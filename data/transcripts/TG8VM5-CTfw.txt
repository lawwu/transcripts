[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.580]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.820]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.960]   Today marks the second episode in our Journal Club series
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.500]   with myself and Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.320]   Dr. Peter Attia, as many of you know,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.460]   is a medical doctor who is a world expert
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.280]   in all things healthspan and lifespan.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.080]   He is the author of the bestselling book, "Outlive,"
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.520]   as well as the host of his own terrific podcast, "The Drive."
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.460]   For today's episode,
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.800]   Peter and I each select a different paper to share with you.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.840]   We selected these papers
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.180]   because we feel they are both extremely interesting
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.880]   and extremely actionable.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.840]   First, I present a paper that is about how light exposure
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.540]   during the morning and daytime,
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.240]   as well as dark exposure at night,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.800]   each have independent and positive effects on mental health,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.840]   as well as the ability to reduce the symptoms
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.600]   of many different mental health disorders.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.980]   Now, I've talked before on this podcast and elsewhere
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.160]   about the key importance of seeing morning sunlight,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.680]   as well as trying to be in dim light at night.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.160]   However, the data presented in the paper today
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.720]   really expands on that by identifying the key importance
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.480]   of not just morning sunlight,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.440]   but getting bright light in one's eyes
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.200]   as much as is safely possible throughout the entire day
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.200]   and a separate additive effect of being in as much darkness
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.880]   at night as possible.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.720]   I describe the data in a lot of detail,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.880]   although you do not need a background in biology
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880]   in order to understand that discussion.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.840]   And there's a key takeaway,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.760]   which is that if you can't get enough light in your eyes
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.540]   during the daytime, you would be well-advised
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.720]   to get as much darkness exposure at night.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.120]   In other words, light and dark have independent
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.600]   and additive effects on mental health.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.700]   And during today's discussion,
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.160]   you'll learn exactly how to apply light exposure
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.780]   and dark exposure in order to get those benefits.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.080]   Then Peter presents a paper
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.620]   about novel treatments for cancer.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.880]   I must say it's an extremely important conversation
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.520]   that everybody, regardless of whether or not
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.820]   you may have had cancer or know somebody who's had cancer,
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.160]   ought to listen to.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.100]   He highlights the current technology of cancer treatments,
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.320]   as well as the future technology of cancer treatments,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.880]   and the key role that the immune system
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.120]   and the autoimmune system play in treatments for cancer.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.300]   I assure you that by the end
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.140]   of today's Journal Club episode,
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.680]   you will have learned a ton of new information
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.280]   about light and dark and mental health,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.620]   as well as cancer and the immune system
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.800]   and treatments for curing cancer.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.300]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.000]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.060]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.940]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.940]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.420]   to the general public.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.540]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.560]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.220]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.100]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.100]   I've spoken many times before in this podcast
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.160]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.760]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.420]   Now, a key component of getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020]   is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.840]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.460]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.500]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.520]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.300]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.600]   One of the best ways to make sure
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.120]   that those temperature changes occur
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.880]   at the appropriate times, at the beginning and throughout,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.020]   and at the end of your night when you wake up,
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.580]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.680]   And that's what Eight Sleep allows you to do.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.040]   It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.140]   and sleeping environment such that you fall
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.540]   and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.980]   feeling incredibly refreshed and energized.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.740]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.100]   for almost three years now,
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.940]   and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.740]   So much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.300]   or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my Eight Sleep,
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.740]   I very much look forward to getting home
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.600]   because my sleep is always better
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.660]   when I sleep on my Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.980]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.920]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.080]   to get $150 off their Pod3 mattress cover.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.040]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.260]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.680]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.800]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.580]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.480]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.180]   I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.660]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.100]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.700]   but pretty soon I realized
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.520]   that therapy is extremely valuable.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.820]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.580]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.900]   including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.980]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.940]   The reason I know therapy is so valuable
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.680]   is that if you can find a therapist
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.280]   with whom you can develop a really good rapport,
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.580]   you not only get terrific support
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.520]   for some of the challenges in your life,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.140]   but you also can derive tremendous insights
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.260]   from that therapy.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.020]   Insights that can allow you to better
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.700]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.980]   but of course also the relationship to yourself
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.300]   and to your professional life, to all sorts of career goals.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.540]   In fact, I see therapy as one of the key components
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.260]   for meshing together all aspects of one's life
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.180]   and being able to really direct one's focus and attention
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.900]   toward what really matters.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.100]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.580]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.220]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.140]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.020]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.340]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.480]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.780]   on this podcast, it's the incredible role
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.140]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.580]   Of course, I'm always telling people
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.180]   that they should get sunlight in their eyes
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.620]   as soon as possible after waking on as many days
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.100]   of their life as possible
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.600]   for sake of setting circadian rhythm,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.740]   daytime mood focus and alertness, and improve sleep.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.520]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.300]   red light and near infrared light
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.740]   has been shown to have positive effects
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.100]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.500]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.620]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.360]   even improvements in acne, or that is removal of acne,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.120]   reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.980]   improving mitochondrial function,
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.500]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   What sets Juve apart
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.860]   and why it's my preferred red light therapy device
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.760]   is that it has clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.540]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.800]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.620]   that trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.760]   Personally, I use the handheld Juve every day.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.020]   The handheld Juve is about the size
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.500]   of a thick piece of toast.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.080]   And I also own a Juve panel
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.460]   that allows for full body exposure.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.780]   And I use that one approximately five times per week
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.040]   for about 10 to 15 minutes per session.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.160]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.040]   you can go to Juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.840]   Again, that's juve.com/huberman.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.880]   For this month only, January, 2024,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.080]   Juve is offering exclusive discounts
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.600]   to Huberman Lab listeners
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.500]   with up to $500 off select Juve products.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.680]   Again, that's juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.720]   to get up to $500 off select Juve products.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.960]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.900]   Andrew, great to have you here for Journal Club number two.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.040]   I'm already confident this is gonna become a regular for us.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.880]   I'm excited.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.720]   I really enjoy this because I get to pick papers.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.000]   I get to hear papers that you're excited about.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.960]   And we get to sharpen our skills
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.700]   at reading and sharing data.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.160]   And people listening can do that as well.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.640]   So last time I went first,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.740]   so I think I'm gonna put you on the hot seat first
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.180]   and have you go first and I'll follow you.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.800]   Okay.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.880]   Well, I'm really excited about this paper
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.160]   for a number of reasons.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.480]   First of all, it, at least by my read,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.960]   is a very powerful paper in the sense
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.840]   that it examined light exposure behavior
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.260]   as well as dark exposure behavior.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.880]   And that's gonna be an important point
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   in more than 85,000 people as part of this cohort in the UK.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.900]   I'll just mention a couple of things
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.880]   to give people background,
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.360]   and I'll keep this relatively brief.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.000]   First of all, there's a longstanding interest
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.680]   in the relationship between light and mental health
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.800]   and physical health.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   And we can throw up some very well-agreed-upon bullet points.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.640]   First of all, there is such a thing
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.440]   as seasonal affective disorder.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.180]   It doesn't just impact people
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.560]   living at really northern locations,
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.480]   but basically there's a correlation
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.380]   between day length and mood and mental health,
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.600]   such that for many people, not all, but for many people,
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.960]   when days are longer in the spring and summer,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.240]   they feel better.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.940]   They report fewer depressive symptoms.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.940]   And conversely, when days are shorter,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.920]   significantly more people report
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.000]   feeling lower mood and affect.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.080]   Okay, so there's a longstanding treatment
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.900]   for seasonal affective disorder,
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.600]   which is to give people exposure to very bright light,
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.900]   especially in the morning.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.900]   The way that that's normally accomplished
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.520]   is with these SAD lamps, seasonal affective disorder lamps.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.860]   And those lamps are basically bright,
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.340]   meaning more than 10,000 lux lights
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.420]   that they place on their kitchen counter
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.060]   or at their table in the morning or in their office.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.500]   So they're getting a lot of bright light.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.620]   That has proven to be fairly effective
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.120]   for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.360]   What's less understood is how light exposure
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.200]   in the middle of the night
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.400]   can negatively impact mood and health.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so where we are headed with this
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.300]   is that there seems to be,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.720]   based on the conclusions of this new study,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.900]   a powerful and independent role
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.800]   of both daytime light exposure
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.840]   and nighttime dark exposure for mental health.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.960]   Now, a couple of other key points,
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.680]   the biological mechanisms for all this
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.520]   are really well-established.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.980]   There's a set of cells in the neural retina,
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.500]   which aligns the back of your eye.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.340]   They're sometimes called
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.160]   intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.560]   or sometimes called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.600]   We'll talk about those in a bit of detail in a moment.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.900]   It's well-known that those cells are the ones
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.480]   that respond to two different types of light input,
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.260]   not one, but two different types of light input,
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.320]   and send information to the hypothalamus,
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.400]   where your master circadian clock resides,
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.080]   and then your master circadian clock
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.340]   sends out secretory signals, so peptides, hormones,
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.320]   but also neural signals to the brain and body,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.980]   and say, "Hey, now it's daytime, now it's nighttime.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.500]   Be awake, be asleep."
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.940]   But it goes way beyond that.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.240]   These melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.000]   retinal ganglion cells, we know,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   also project to areas of the brain like the habenula,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.080]   which can trigger negative affect, negative mood.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.720]   They can trigger the release of dopamine
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.320]   or the suppression of dopamine, the release of serotonin,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.400]   the suppression of serotonin.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.620]   And so they're not just cells
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.000]   for setting your circadian clock.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.340]   They also have a direct line, literally one synapse away,
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.800]   into the structures of the brain
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.720]   that we know powerfully control mood.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.320]   So the mechanistic basis for all this is there.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.760]   So there's just a couple of other key points to understand
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.980]   for people to really be able to digest
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.040]   the data in this paper fully.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.400]   There are basically two types of stimuli
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.280]   that these cells respond to.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.000]   One is very bright light, as we just talked about.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.240]   That's why getting a lot of daytime sunlight
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.340]   is correlated with elevated mood.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.060]   That's why looking at a 10,000 lux artificial lamp
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.160]   can offset seasonal affective disorder.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.540]   - By the way, just a couple of questions on that.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.440]   How many lux does the sun provide on a sunny day at noon?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.760]   - Okay, great question.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.160]   So if you're out in the sun with no cloud cover
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.840]   or minimal cloud cover in the middle of the day at noon,
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.320]   chances are it's over 100,000 lux.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.880]   On a really bright day, could be 300,000 lux, okay?
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.980]   Most indoor environments,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.300]   even though they might seem very bright,
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.800]   I like to think of your kind of like department store
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.920]   with the bright lights, believe it or not,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.740]   that's probably only closer to 6,000 lux maximum
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.520]   and probably more like 4,000 lux.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.560]   Most brightly lit indoor environments are not that bright
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.320]   when it comes down to total photon energy.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.520]   Now, here's the interesting thing.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.240]   On a cloudy day, when you're outside,
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:43.040]   it can be as bright as an average of 100,000 lux,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.020]   but it won't seem that bright
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.700]   because you don't quote unquote see the sun,
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.640]   but it's also because when there's cloud cover,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.540]   a lot of those long wavelengths of light,
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.560]   such as orange and red light, aren't coming through.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.000]   However, and this is so important,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.420]   the circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.900]   it sums photons.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.900]   It's a photon summing system.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.080]   So basically if you're outside in 8,000 lux,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.540]   very overcast UK winter day,
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.440]   and you're walking around hopefully without sunglasses
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.760]   because sunglasses are gonna filter
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.200]   a lot of those photons out,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.400]   your circadian clock is summing the photons.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.920]   So it's an integration mechanism.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.760]   It's not triggered in a moment.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.120]   And actually the experiments of recording from these cells
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.200]   first done by David Berson at Brown
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.040]   were historic in the field of visual neuroscience
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.800]   when shown bright light
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.400]   on these intrinsically photosensitive cells,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.800]   crank up the intensity of the light
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   and the neurons would ramp up their membrane potential
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.040]   and then start spiking, firing action potentials,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.600]   long trains of action potentials
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.440]   that have been shown to go on for hours.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.520]   And so that's the signal that's propagating
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.440]   into the whole brain and body.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.120]   Okay, so the important thing to understand
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.880]   is this is not a quick switch.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.560]   That's why I suggest on non cloudy days, we'll call them,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.400]   that people get 10 minutes or so of sunlight in their eyes
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.000]   in the early part of the day,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.980]   another 10 minimum in the later part of the day,
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.240]   as much sunlight in their eyes
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.720]   as they safely can throughout the day.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.680]   But since you're a physician, I should just,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.480]   and you had a guest on talking about this recently,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.440]   when the sun is low in the sky, low solar angle sunlight,
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.440]   that's really the key time
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.000]   for reasons we'll talk about in a moment.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.900]   And when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.480]   you run very, very little risk of inducing cataract
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.200]   by looking in the general direction of the sun.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.660]   You should still blink as needed to protect the eyes.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.320]   It's when the sun is overhead
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   and there's all those photons coming in quickly
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.840]   in a short period of time that you do have to be concerned
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.660]   about cataract and macular degeneration
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.940]   if you're getting too much daytime sunlight.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.300]   So the idea is sunglasses in the middle of the day are fine,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.660]   but you really should avoid using them
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.460]   in the early and later part of the day,
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.020]   unless you're driving into the sun
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.620]   and you need, you know, for safety reasons.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.700]   - Another question, Andrew. - Yeah.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.960]   - If a person is indoors, but they have large windows,
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.340]   so they're getting tons of sunlight into their space,
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.820]   they don't even need ambient indoor light,
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.300]   how much of the photons are making it through the glass?
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.480]   And how does that compare to this effect?
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.140]   - Yeah, in general,
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.080]   unless the light is coming directly through the window,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.680]   most of the relevant wavelengths are filtered out.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.740]   - In other words, if you can't see the sun
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.860]   through the window,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.580]   even if sufficient light is being provided,
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.400]   that's insufficient to trigger this phenomenon?
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.240]   - That's right.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.820]   However, if you have, you know, windows on your roof,
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.540]   which some people do, skylights,
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.260]   that makes the situation much, much better.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.940]   In fact, the neurons that, in the eye,
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.120]   that signal to the circadian clock
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.540]   and these mood centers in the brain reside mainly
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.340]   in the bottom two thirds of the neural retina
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.020]   and are responsible for looking up, basically.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.220]   They're gathering light from above.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.420]   These cells are also very low resolution,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.940]   so think of them as big pixels.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.540]   They're not interested in patterns and edges and movement.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.260]   They're interested in how much ambient light
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.360]   there happens to be.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.560]   Now, keep in mind that this mechanism is perhaps
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.280]   the most well-conserved mechanism in cellular organisms.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.780]   So there, and I'll use that as a way to frame up
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.180]   the four types of light that one needs to see
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.500]   every 24 hours for optimal health.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.960]   And when I say optimal health,
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.860]   I really mean mental health and physical health,
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.720]   but we're gonna talk about mental health mainly today
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.560]   in this paper.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.160]   There's an absolutely beautiful evolutionary story
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.300]   whereby single cell organisms, all the way to humans,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.580]   dogs, rabbits, and everything in between
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.180]   have at least two conopsins,
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.040]   one that responds to short wavelength light,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.360]   AKA blue light, and another one that responds
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.580]   to longer wavelength light, orange and red.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.400]   So your dogs have this, we have this,
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.520]   and it's a comparison mechanism in these cells of the eye,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.380]   these neurons of the eye.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.440]   They compare contrast between blues and orange,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.060]   or sometimes blues and reds and pinks,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.360]   which are also all long wavelength light.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.540]   There are two times of day when the sky is enriched
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.980]   with blues, oranges, pinks, and reds,
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.440]   and that's low solar angle sunlight at sunrise
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.480]   and in the evening.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.420]   These cells are uniquely available to trigger
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.740]   the existence of those wavelengths of light
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.460]   early in the day and in the evening,
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.820]   not in the middle of the day.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.980]   So these cells have these two cone photopigments
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.800]   and they say, "How much blue light is there?
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.940]   How much red light is there?" or orange light.
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.300]   And the subtraction between those two
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.540]   triggers the signal for them to fire the signal off
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.460]   to the circadian clock of the brain.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   And that's why I say,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.940]   "Look at low solar angle sunlight early in the day."
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.300]   What that does is it,
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.480]   what we call it is phase advances the clock.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.540]   This can get a little technical
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.880]   and we don't want to get too technical here,
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.080]   but think about pushing your kid on a swing.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.820]   The period of that swing, the duration of that swing
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.480]   is a little bit longer than 12 hours, okay?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.000]   So when you stand closer to the kid,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.340]   so your kid swings back and you give it a push,
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.980]   you're shortening the period, right?
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.620]   You're not allowing the swing to come all the way up.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.720]   That's what happens when you look at morning sunlight.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.520]   You're advancing your circadian clock.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.980]   Translated to English or non nerd speak,
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.440]   you're making it such that you will want to go to bed
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.360]   a little bit earlier and wake up a little bit earlier
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.200]   the next day.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.280]   In the evening, when you view low solar angle sunlight,
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.960]   so in the afternoon setting sun or evening setting sun,
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.400]   you do the exact opposite.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.000]   You're phase delaying the clock.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.120]   It's the equivalent of your kid
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.000]   being at the very top of the arc.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.480]   And so it's gone maybe 12 and a half hour,
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.640]   let's say 12 and a half hours
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.520]   is the duration of that swing.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.920]   And you run up and you push them from behind
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.400]   and give them a little more push.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.960]   That's the equivalent of making yourself
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.580]   stay up a little later and wake up a little later.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.880]   These two signals average so that your clock stays stable.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.720]   You don't drift,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.520]   meaning you're not waking up earlier every single day
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.480]   or going to sleep later every single day.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.320]   This is why it's important to view low solar angle sunlight
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.500]   in the morning and again in the evening
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.600]   as often as possible.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.120]   And it's done by that readout of those two photo pigments.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.120]   Now, midday sun, which contains its bright light,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.680]   but you see it as white light,
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.640]   contains all of those wavelengths at equal intensity.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.780]   So the middle of the day
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.300]   is the so-called circadian dead zone.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.620]   In the middle of the day,
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.260]   bright light triggers the activation of the other ops
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.760]   and the melanopsin, which increases mood,
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.200]   increases feelings of wellbeing,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.320]   has some other consequences.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.980]   But you can't shift your circadian clock
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.840]   by viewing the sun in the middle of the day
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.540]   because it's in the circadian dead zone.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.820]   It's the equivalent of pushing your kid on the swing
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.060]   when they're at the bottom of the arc.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.180]   You can get a little bit more, but not much.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.860]   And in biological terms, you get nothing.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.140]   So this is why looking at sunlight
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.180]   in the middle of the day is great,
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.340]   but it's not gonna help anchor your sleep-wake cycle.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.780]   And if you think about it, this is incredible, right?
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.280]   Every organism from single cells to us has this mechanism
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.680]   to know when the sun is rising and when the sun is setting.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.040]   And it's a color comparison mechanism,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.940]   which tells us that actually color vision evolved first,
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.160]   not for pattern vision, not for seeing beautiful sunsets
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.540]   and recognizing that's beautiful
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.460]   or paintings or things of that sort,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.580]   but rather for setting the circadian clock.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.080]   - Now, what if you only do one of these, Andrew?
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.580]   So what if you've got constant exposure
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.680]   to low morning light, but your job prevents you
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.460]   from doing the same in the evening or vice versa?
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.860]   - Yeah, a great question.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.860]   Better to get the morning light
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.140]   because if you have to pick between low solar angle light
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.860]   earlier or later in the day.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.080]   And keep in mind, if you miss a day, no big deal.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.780]   It's a slow integrative mechanism
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.620]   averaging across the previous two or three days.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.460]   But if you miss a day,
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.620]   you'll wanna get twice as much light in your eyes
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.780]   that next morning.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.580]   The reason it's better to do in the morning
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.680]   as opposed to the evening,
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.620]   although best would be to do both, excuse me,
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.420]   is that most people are getting
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.020]   some artificial light exposure in the evening anyway.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.220]   And here's the diabolical thing.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.220]   Your retina is very insensitive to light
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.060]   early in the day.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.260]   You need a lot of photons to trigger this mechanism
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.220]   early in the day.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.760]   As the day goes on, retinal sensitivity increases
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.020]   and it takes very little light
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.820]   to shift your circadian clock late in the day.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.460]   Keep in mind also that if you do see afternoon
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.700]   and evening sunlight,
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.620]   there's a beautiful study published in Science Reports,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.260]   yes, Science Reports, two years ago,
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.580]   showing that that can partially offset
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.420]   the negative effects of artificial light exposure at night.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.140]   I think of this as your Netflix inoculation.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.940]   The amount of melatonin suppression
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.840]   from nighttime light exposure
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.540]   is halved by viewing evening setting sun.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.380]   Now, keep in mind,
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.020]   you don't need to see the sun cross the horizon.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.820]   It can just be when it's low solar angle.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.700]   So you're looking for those yellow, blue,
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.220]   or blue, pink, blue-red contrasts.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.180]   And on cloudy days, believe it or not, they're still there.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.300]   Just you don't perceive as much of it coming through.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.660]   So that's three things that we should all strive to do.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.820]   View low solar angle sunlight early in the day,
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.980]   view solar angle sunlight later in the day,
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.060]   and get as much bright light in our eyes as we safely can,
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.180]   ideally from sunlight throughout the day.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.300]   And if you can't do that,
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.820]   perhaps invest in one of these satellites
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.580]   so that they can be a bit expensive.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.420]   There are a couple of companies
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.180]   that are starting to design sunrise simulators
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.620]   and evening simulators that are actually good,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.400]   that actually work.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.780]   But right now, my read is that aside from one company
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.340]   out there, which by the way, I have no relationship to,
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.420]   it's called the TUO light, T-U-O.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.300]   And that light bulb was developed by the biologists
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.280]   at the University of Washington who basically discovered
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.180]   these color opponent mechanisms.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.740]   Those lights are not particularly expensive,
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.500]   but they do seem to work.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.740]   In fact, the study that is emerging,
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.620]   again, unpublished data seems to indicate
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.300]   that if you look at it for more than five or six minutes,
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.260]   it can induce a mild euphoria.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.460]   That's how powerful this contrast is.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.700]   And what they did there in that light,
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.140]   I'll just tell you the mechanism is they figured out
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.180]   that when most people look at low solar angle sunlight
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.100]   in the morning, they're getting 19 reversals
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.780]   of blue-orange per second.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.760]   So when you look at this light,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.300]   it looks like a barely flashing white light,
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.320]   but it's reversals of orange and blue,
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.860]   orange and red and blue, and it's happening very fast.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.900]   - And so what does the person looking at it perceive?
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.460]   - Well, I've used one of these.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.700]   It just looks like a flickering light.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.500]   And of course, there's always the potential
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.660]   of a placebo effect, but--
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.500]   - Well, that's what I was gonna say.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.740]   Is there a way to control for that by having something
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.420]   that looks the same to the user,
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.340]   but of course is not producing the same photo effect?
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.320]   - Yeah, well, they've done that
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.020]   with the 10,000 lux sad lamps,
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.720]   and which most people use to try
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.760]   and induce sunrise simulation in their home.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.340]   But keep in mind that sunrise gives you this comparison
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.660]   of short and long wavelength light.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.960]   Just a bright 10,000 lux light triggers one of the options,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.980]   but it won't set your circadian clock.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.340]   So most of the sad lamps that are out there
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.320]   are activating only one of the mechanisms
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.060]   in these cells that's relevant,
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.020]   and not the one that's most relevant.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.920]   So I'm excited about what TUO is doing.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.580]   I think that, and again, I have no relation to them,
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.540]   except that I know the biologists who did the work
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.400]   that provide the mechanistic logic for that engineering.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   I still think we're in the really early days of this stuff.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.840]   What should be done is to have this stuff
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.960]   built into your laptop, right?
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.360]   It should be built into your phone,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.680]   and hopefully it will be.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.640]   Now, I mentioned this color contrast thing
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.000]   in sunrise and sunset.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I mentioned the bright light throughout the day,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.120]   but there's a fourth light stimulus
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.400]   that turns out to be really important,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.760]   and this will provide the segue into the paper.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.180]   Turns out that dark exposure at night, independent
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.660]   of light exposure during the day,
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.100]   is important for mental health outcomes.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.980]   Now, most people think dark exposure,
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.880]   how do I think about that?
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.740]   Well, it is dark yet- - Absence of light exposure.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.380]   - It's the absence of light,
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.900]   but what this paper really drives home is that people
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.860]   who make it a point to get dark exposure at night,
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.660]   AKA the absence of light at night, actually benefit,
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.900]   even if they're not getting enough sunlight during the day,
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.540]   and this is especially true for people
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.740]   with certain mental health issues.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.500]   So I don't think we can overstate the value
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   of accurately timed light exposure to the eyes
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.220]   in the context of mental health.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.940]   I think, you know, there's so much data by now.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.640]   I will say, however, that some people seem more resilient
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.100]   to these light effects than others, meaning some people,
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.260]   you know, also don't suffer from jet lag too much.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.760]   Some people can stay up late,
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.560]   get a lot of bright light exposure in the middle of the night
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.100]   and during the day, they've got their sunglasses on all day
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.780]   and they're in a great mood all the time.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.180]   Other people are more susceptible to these sorts of things.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.620]   And we don't know whether or not
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.900]   polymorphisms underlie that.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.820]   I personally am very sensitive to sunlight
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.140]   in the sense that if I don't get enough sunlight,
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.520]   I don't feel well after a couple of days,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.900]   but I'm less sensitive to light exposure at night,
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:25.860]   for instance.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.980]   But I think it is perhaps, this is a big statement,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.260]   but it is perhaps the most fundamental
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.460]   environmental stimulus for levels of arousal and alertness,
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.580]   which correlate with all sorts of, you know,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.660]   neuromodulator and hormone outputs.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.860]   And so none of this should come as any surprise.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.020]   I will mention one last thing.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.400]   There was a study published, gosh, over 10 years ago now
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.020]   from Chuck Zeisser's lab at Harvard Medical School.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.420]   It's a phenomenal lab exploring
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.140]   circadian human health behavior.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.000]   He's just considered, no pun, a luminary in the field.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.300]   But there wasn't a study that was in error
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.300]   where they had published in Science Magazine
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.440]   that light shown behind the knee
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.940]   could shift circadian rhythms.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.300]   And that paper was retracted.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.160]   And a lot of people don't know that it was retracted.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.920]   Light exposure to the eyes is what's relevant here.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.020]   And as far as we know, the color of one's eyes,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.920]   like the darkness or lightness of one's eyes,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.200]   bears no relevance on their sensitivity
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.220]   to these types of mechanisms and on and on.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.660]   - So one question, one comment.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.040]   The question again is going back
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.540]   to the morning, evening light.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.040]   And I spend a lot of time looking at those types of skies,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.260]   for example, just 'cause of the nature of my hobbies,
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.980]   'cause I'm always doing archery in the morning
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.500]   and rucking in the afternoon.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.420]   So it's not uncommon that I'm seeing both of those.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.100]   How relevant is it that the sun be above the horizon?
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.840]   So for example, it begins to get light
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.860]   about 30 minutes before sunrise.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.860]   And then, so if sun rises at 7.30, first light is seven.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.240]   And then, sort of 7.15 to 7.30 is actually quite bright.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.080]   I mean, you can see anything and everything.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.680]   And the same is true at sunset.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.060]   So does that 30 minutes pre,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.320]   or when sun is beneath the horizon,
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.820]   constitute part of that 10 minutes?
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.660]   - It does.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.520]   I mean, in an ideal circumstance,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.100]   you'd get outside and see the sunrise every day,
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.420]   and you'd see the sunset every day, even on cloudy days.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.500]   Some people, like myself, wake up before the sun comes up.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.520]   And I get this question all the time.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.400]   Well, in the absence of powers to make the sunrise faster,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.820]   which I'm not aware anyone has, certainly not me,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.380]   I think the best thing to do is simply
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.500]   to turn on as many bright lights as you can indoors
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.020]   to trigger that melanopsin mechanism.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.500]   If you wanna be awake, if you wanna stay asleep or sleepy,
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.060]   then keep them dim, and then get outside
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.180]   once the sun is starting to come out.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.120]   Some people wake up after the sun has risen, right?
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.020]   In which case, get what you can.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.260]   And some people wake up 10 a.m. or noon,
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.420]   in which case, you can still get the bright light exposure,
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.900]   but you won't shift your circadian clock.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.380]   Now, in the evening, especially in the winter months,
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.200]   it's important to look west and try and get some sunlight
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.240]   in your eyes in the evening.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.060]   If you've ever gone into the clinic, for instance,
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.640]   at two o'clock in the afternoon, after lunch,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.440]   and then in the winter, and then come out and it's dark
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.220]   when you're walking to your car,
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.960]   it's a kind of eerie feeling.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.880]   That sort of eerie feeling may correlate
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.820]   with the fact that you missed a signal.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.980]   Your brain is trying to orient your brain and body in time,
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.680]   and that's what all of this is, right?
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.060]   It's trying to orient in time.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.820]   And again, some people are more susceptible
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.660]   to that than others.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.920]   Some people might like that feeling of,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.320]   oh, I went in when it was bright,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.820]   and I come out when it's dark.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.420]   But the vast majority of people feel better
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.580]   when they're getting this morning
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.820]   and evening sunlight exposure.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.260]   And this is especially important in kids, all right?
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.740]   This is one of the things that this paper points out,
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.220]   and there are good data, that people are spending
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.160]   approximately 90% of their time indoors nowadays.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.260]   Daytime time, indoors.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.700]   And those indoor environments are simply not bright enough.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.060]   You think, oh, there's all these bright lights.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.100]   And some people are putting blue blockers on
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.180]   in the middle of the day,
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.100]   which is the worst thing you could possibly do.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.260]   If you're gonna wear blue blockers,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.420]   and I don't think they're necessary,
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.260]   but if you're going to wear them,
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.180]   you'd wanna wear them at night.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.580]   And in the evening, you don't need to wear blue blockers,
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.700]   you just simply should dim the lights,
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.660]   and ideally have lights that are set
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.660]   a little bit lower in your environment,
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.160]   which the Scandinavians have been doing for a long time.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.580]   So kill the overhead lights.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.340]   And don't obsess about bright light exposure
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.180]   in the middle of the night.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.600]   In fact, for a long time,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.060]   I and some other people were saying,
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.180]   oh, you know, even just a brief flash of light
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.700]   in the middle of the night can quash your melatonin.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.100]   That's true, but the other time in which
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.420]   you're in this quote unquote circadian dead zone
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.660]   is in the middle of the night.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.120]   You can't shift your circadian clock
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.780]   in the middle of the night.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:53.180]   But all of this gets down to interweaving rhythms
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.940]   of light sensitivity, temperature, hormone output, cortisol.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.700]   I mean, there's a whole landscape of circadian biology.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.760]   This paper, which was published in a new journal
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.380]   I'm really excited about called "Nature Mental Health,"
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.380]   this journal was just launched recently,
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.060]   is entitled "Day and Night Light Exposure are Associated
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.060]   with Psychiatric Disorders and Objective Light Study
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.100]   in More Than 85,000 People."
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.180]   Now I have to say that I think the title
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.020]   of this paper is terrible.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.840]   Sorry, folks at "Nature Mental Health,"
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.720]   because if one just read the title,
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.780]   it sounds like day and night light exposure
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.440]   are associated with psychiatric disorders, right?
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.700]   If this were a newspaper headline, you'd be like,
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.740]   oh my goodness, well, what are you supposed to do, right?
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.140]   But that's not the conclusion.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.980]   The conclusion is that getting a lot of sunlight exposure
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.080]   during the day and getting a lot of dark exposure at night
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.860]   is immensely beneficial for psychiatric health
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.940]   and in a number of ways.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.620]   Now, I'm not one to bring up another paper unannounced,
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.280]   but I will say that this paper built off a previous study
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.800]   entitled "Time spent in outdoor light is associated
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.300]   with mood, sleep, and circadian rhythm related outcomes."
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.500]   And that was a cross-sectional longitudinal study
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.060]   in 400,000 biobank participants.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.520]   So this UK biobank is an incredibly valuable resource,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.920]   and there are now multiple studies establishing
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.060]   that one's pattern of light exposure is extremely important.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.980]   Now, the previous study in 400,000 participants
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.580]   basically nailed home the idea
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.620]   that the more time you spend outdoors,
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.820]   the better is your mood, the better is your sleep,
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.800]   the better is the rhythmicity of your sleep-wake cycles,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.820]   and on and on.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.140]   Something that I think, even though people will say,
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.540]   we've known that for thousands of years,
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.780]   needed scientific substantiation.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.000]   This new study essentially looked at
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.600]   the relative contributions of daytime light exposure
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.520]   and nighttime dark exposure,
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.460]   and they did that on a background of looking,
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.600]   in particular, people who had major depressive disorder,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.680]   generalized anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:04.540]   Here's the basic takeaway, and I'll quote them here,
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.860]   and then I'll tell you my interpretation.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.700]   Here I'm quoting,
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.440]   "Avoiding night at light and seeking light during the day,"
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.760]   I love that word, seeking,
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.820]   "may be a simple and effective non-pharmacologic means
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.580]   for broadly improving mental health."
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.340]   So that's a pretty bold statement, right?
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.620]   And I love that they say seeking
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.300]   because it implies that people aren't reflexively
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.040]   getting the light exposure that they need,
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.540]   that this needs to be a practice,
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.540]   much like zone two cardio or resistance training.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.000]   Okay, so what do they do in this study?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.340]   So basically, they gathered up 100,000 people or so,
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:42.200]   it eventually was paired down to about 86,000 participants
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.840]   'cause some just didn't qualify
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.900]   or didn't report their data back.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.200]   They equipped them with accelerometers on their wrist,
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.580]   and those wrist devices also could measure ambient light.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.140]   Now, that's not a perfect tool
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.800]   'cause what you'd love to do is measure ambient light
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.440]   at the level of the eyes.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.380]   By the way, will somebody design an eyeglass frame
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.460]   that changes color when you've gotten sufficient light
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.660]   from sunlight during the day,
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.260]   and then at night is a different color,
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.880]   and then if you're getting too much light exposure,
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.420]   will go to a different color frame?
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.340]   This has to be possible so that you don't have to wonder
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.340]   if you got enough light during the day.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.220]   And of course, if it's at the level of the eyes,
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.340]   then you know that's what's landing at the eyes.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.700]   - Ian, I mean, that's what I was gonna ask you about that.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.380]   Do these wrist-based devices
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.580]   potentially get covered by clothing in some-
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.280]   - Turned over. - You have your sleeves down.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.340]   I have my sleeves up.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.820]   - They had it on the outside of the sleeve,
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.140]   but they asked that people just keep it
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.340]   on their dominant hand.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.820]   It's not perfect,
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.300]   but in some ways it's kind of nice that it's not perfect.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.660]   We could turn that disadvantage into advantage by thinking,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.060]   when the person is out and about,
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.860]   they're not often looking right at the sun.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.940]   If you're talking to a colleague
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.980]   under an overhang, for instance.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.420]   So it's not perfect. - It's directionally.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.860]   - It's directionally right.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.160]   Okay, and then they had two hypotheses,
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.240]   two primary hypotheses.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.780]   One, that greater light exposure in the day
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.140]   is associated with lower risk for psychiatric disorders,
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.180]   and two, second hypotheses,
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.620]   greater light exposure at night
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.460]   is associated with higher risk for psychiatric disorders
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.580]   and poorer mood.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.060]   This is oh so relevant for the way we live now,
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.760]   people on screens and tablets in the middle of the night.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.980]   Okay, then they collected information
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.800]   about how much light exposure people were getting,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.280]   as well as their sleep and their activity and so on.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.020]   I should mention this was done in males and females.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.620]   It was a slightly older cohort
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.840]   than one is used to seeing people in their 50s and 60s.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.180]   They had psychiatric diagnosis information,
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.500]   and then they divided people into essentially two groups,
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.420]   but they had a lower, so a Q1 and a Q2, a lower quartile.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.940]   That meant people that were getting less daytime light
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.180]   as opposed to the third and fourth quartile,
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.540]   more daytime light.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.340]   They also had a nighttime light exposure evaluation,
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.280]   and they had people in the low Q1 and Q2,
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.260]   so these people are getting less nighttime light
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.600]   versus Q3, Q4, more nighttime light.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.020]   Nicely, they also looked at sleep duration,
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.240]   and they looked at photo period,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.020]   meaning how long the days were for those individuals,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.140]   how active they were, like 10 hours a day, 14 hours a day,
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.940]   because the more active you are,
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.920]   the more opportunity for light exposure you have
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.180]   during the day or night, for instance.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:24.180]   Okay, so they had, I would say, fairly complete data sets.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:29.420]   Then, and I'm just gonna hit the top contour
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.260]   of what they did in each.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.060]   Sorry, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, et cetera,
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.800]   was determined off the accelerometer.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.900]   That's right, as well as self-report.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.500]   Yeah, not ideal, right?
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.520]   You'd love for people to be wearing a whoop bander
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.540]   or a ring or something of that sort,
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.800]   but this was initiated some time ago,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.040]   so they either didn't have access to that technology
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.080]   or, for whatever reason, didn't select it.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.620]   I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.580]   and thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.200]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.480]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.600]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.880]   The reason I started taking it
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.680]   and the reason I still take it every day
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.020]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.800]   for vitamins and minerals,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.660]   and it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.180]   to support gut health.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.640]   Now, gut health is something that, over the last 10 years,
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.620]   we realized is not just important
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.440]   for the health of our gut, but also for our immune system
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.600]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.160]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin,
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.120]   in other words, gut health is critical
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.000]   for proper brain functioning.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.680]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.120]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.080]   but there are a number of things in AG1,
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.760]   including specific micronutrients
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.320]   that are hard to get from whole foods
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.200]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.620]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.400]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.960]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.120]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.700]   what that supplement should be,
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.240]   I tell them AG1,
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.540]   because AG1 supports so many different systems
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.740]   within the body that are involved in mental health,
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.360]   physical health, and performance.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.260]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.400]   and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.500]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.080]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.860]   Then what they did is they have information
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.840]   on who has major depressive disorder,
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.740]   who has PTSD, generalized anxiety, bipolar, psychosis,
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:32.160]   et cetera, and then they ran three models.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.300]   And you can tell me what you think
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.540]   about the power of these models,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.480]   but as somebody who thinks about the mechanistic aspect
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.640]   of all of this a lot,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.080]   but not somebody who's ever run this type of study,
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.600]   I'd be really curious.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.680]   Model one examined the unadjusted association
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.820]   between day and nighttime light exposure
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.000]   and psychiatric outcomes.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.880]   So just basically asking, is there a relationship
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.000]   between how much light you get during the day
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.840]   and how much light you get at night
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   and how bad your depression is or anxiety is, et cetera.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.520]   Looking at just a standard ratio of the probability
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.320]   that you have a certain symptom or set of symptoms
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.720]   versus you don't given a certain amount of light exposure.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.280]   Model two adjusted for the age of the person,
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.080]   their sex and ethnicity, and photo period.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.000]   So they looked at how long the days were
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.520]   in that given person's region of the world.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.360]   And then model three--
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.080]   - Were these people were all in the UK
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.920]   or were they around the world?
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.680]   - They were all in the UK, as far as I know.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.260]   And then model three adjusted for employment.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.920]   So employed versus unemployed,
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.600]   which if you think about it is pretty important.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.020]   Like you say, well, an unemployed person
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.440]   has a lot more time to control these variables,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.160]   but an employed person who's doing shift work does not.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.640]   And they incorporated information
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.280]   about employed versus unemployed physical activity,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.440]   which turns out to be very important.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.000]   And then things like shift work, et cetera.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.160]   And so these, what we can say very safely
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.300]   is that the outcomes with each of these models,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.780]   the results were very similar.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.820]   So we don't want to discard the differences
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.180]   between those models entirely.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.480]   But in my read is in every figure of the paper,
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.080]   it doesn't seem like model one, two or three differ
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.160]   from one another in terms of total outcome.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.220]   - Yeah, that's an unusual aspect of this paper.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.640]   So these adjustments are very standard, right?
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   So this is a classic tool that's used in most epidemiology
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.300]   because you don't have randomization.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   So once randomization is out the window,
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.920]   like so for example, the paper I'm going to present
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.700]   is based on an RCT, there will be no models.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.040]   It's just here are the data.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.520]   - Yeah, here they're asking people, what do you do?
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.940]   Report back to us, we're going to measure
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.920]   your light exposure, but no one was assigned
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.240]   to any groups or swap.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.220]   Whatever quote unquote controls are there,
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.080]   they're really not there.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.000]   It's just comparisons between groups.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.960]   - So what is interesting to me is that
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.240]   it's exactly as you said, and we'll make all these figures
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.960]   available in addition to the papers.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   But I mean, it's very unusual that there's no difference
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.520]   between the unadjusted and the adjusted models.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.520]   And as you say, there's probably two places out of 30
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.120]   when you look at all the different quartile comparisons
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.760]   where you might creep from statistically significant
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.340]   just out of it or just into it.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:35.280]   But yeah, you could simplify this figure two completely
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.800]   by just showing one of the models and you would be
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.480]   getting 95% of the information, which is, you know.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.160]   I mean, I think in one way that suggests
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:52.500]   that there's less dependency on those variables.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.880]   Of course, it still doesn't address
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.440]   probably the greatest question I have here,
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.000]   which I'm sure we'll get to at some point as you continue.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.160]   - Yeah, so I'm very curious what that question is,
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.520]   but I'll suppress my curiosity for the moment.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.320]   You know, so if we look at figure two of this paper,
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.840]   and I realize a lot of people are listening
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.600]   and they're not able to look at this,
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.960]   although we have posted the figures
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.900]   on the YouTube versions of this,
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.080]   just want to make clear what's going on
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.340]   just for those that are listening.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.720]   Essentially what they're looking at
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.380]   is what they call the odds ratio,
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.260]   which is the probability of something happening
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.780]   in one group divided by the probability
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.120]   of something happening in another group.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.880]   I guess, by way of example would be, you know,
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.960]   if you were going to look at the odds ratio of, you know,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.560]   the probability of somebody getting lung cancer
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.080]   if they smoke versus probability
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.640]   of somebody getting lung cancer if they don't smoke.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.160]   - So odds ratios and hazard ratios are often confused.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.840]   They're very similar,
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.160]   and odds ratios generally refer to a lifetime exposure,
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.060]   whereas a hazard ratio is defined
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.760]   over a specific period of time.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.060]   But the math is still effectively the same.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.080]   And using the example you gave,
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:05.000]   if you took the odds ratio of, you know, death,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.020]   so let's talk all-cause mortality for a smoker
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.840]   versus a non-smoker, and the answer were 1.78.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.440]   I'm making that up, but that's directionally correct.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   1.78 as an odds ratio means there's a 78% chance greater
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.000]   of the outcome of interest, in this case,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.120]   death by any cause in the affected group,
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.100]   which would be the smokers.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.120]   So odds ratio of two is 100%,
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.480]   and odds ratio of three is 200%.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.200]   So the math is take the number,
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.600]   subtract one, and that's the percent.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.320]   You know, figure two of this paper
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.160]   is one of the key take-homes.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.920]   They essentially look at the odds ratio
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.120]   of people who are in the, let's say that,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.000]   let's just look at the nighttime light exposure.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.280]   - And just remind me, Andrew,
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.760]   'cause, and everybody else watching,
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.120]   every one of these is showing second, third, fourth
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.120]   as your x-axis, meaning they're all being compared
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.880]   to the first quartile, and the first quartile
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.120]   is lowest light exposure or highest light exposure?
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.400]   - Lowest, well, we have to--
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.840]   - With the differentiate between day and night.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.680]   - That's right.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.920]   - Okay, so restate it.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.880]   - Sure, so if we look at, you know,
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.000]   what is your risk of a psychiatric challenge,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.840]   broadly speaking?
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.940]   Well, panel A is major depressive disorder.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.840]   If you are in the second quartile, third quartile,
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.240]   or fourth quartile of nighttime light exposure,
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.540]   so second being the least amount of nighttime light exposure,
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.240]   third being more nighttime light exposure,
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.960]   and fourth, the most nighttime light exposure
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.540]   relative to the first quartile.
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.160]   - This is just a stupid thing.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.460]   Like, if I were doing this figure,
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.920]   if you were doing this in a lecture,
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.940]   you know what you would do to make it so easy?
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.280]   You would draw arrows on it
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.880]   that say increasing light exposure at night,
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.000]   decreasing light exposure in the day.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.180]   It's the same information.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.360]   It just makes it easier for the reader to understand.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.920]   - But maybe the teaching point, I think,
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.900]   is for people when they review articles,
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.600]   like, don't be afraid to do that and just kind of like,
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.960]   oh, I've got scribble all over this.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.260]   So it's like, I draw the arrow.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.160]   That's increasing light, that's decreasing light,
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.320]   and that's how I can pay attention
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.240]   to what's actually happening.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.920]   - Right, and I'm actually in touch with the editorial staff
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.880]   at Nature Mental Health,
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.900]   although they don't know that I'm covering this paper
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.000]   until after this comes out.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.840]   You know, I think one thing that scientific journals
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.400]   really, really need to do
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   is start making the readability of the articles
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.240]   better for non-experts.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.980]   I mean, chances are, if you can't understand a graph,
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.060]   and this is true for everybody,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.840]   chances are there's a problem with the way it's presented.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.620]   Put it on them, but then, of course, try and parse it,
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.240]   because, you know, rarely, if ever,
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.460]   is it all spelled out clearly.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.860]   But anyway, that's what we're trying to do here.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.620]   So yeah, the way I would have done is, say,
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.620]   second quartile is low amounts of nighttime light exposure
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.100]   and define what that is.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.820]   You know, third quartile is more light exposure,
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.420]   and then fourth, maximum amount of light exposure at night.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.020]   And basically what you see is that the probability
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.140]   of having worse major depressive symptoms
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.380]   linearly increases as you go
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.740]   from the second to third to fourth quartile.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:13.500]   So more nighttime light exposure, worse for you,
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:18.200]   and there's a dose response, if you will, of the effect.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.540]   Now, we can march through or describe figure two
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.620]   pretty quickly by saying the same thing is true,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.540]   and now we're just talking about nighttime light exposure,
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:32.060]   for generalized anxiety disorder, so that's panel C.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.060]   Bipolar disorder, although the difference
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.700]   between the second and third quartile in bipolar disorder
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.260]   isn't as dramatic, once you get up to the fourth quartile,
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.300]   bipolar symptoms get much worse
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.400]   when people are getting nighttime light exposure.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.420]   I really want to emphasize that point,
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.620]   because they go on in the discussion of this paper
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.660]   to reemphasize that point several times.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.900]   In fact, they say that while light exposure during the day,
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.620]   of course, we will go into the data,
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.600]   is beneficial for mental health.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.180]   For people with bipolar disorder,
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.980]   it seems that light exposure at night
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.660]   is especially problematic,
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.000]   independent of how much sunlight
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.840]   they're getting during the day.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.660]   So your bipolar, the person with bipolar disorder
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.660]   who's struggling with either a manic or depressive episode,
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.980]   who's making a point to get sunlight during the day,
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.780]   who's also getting light exposure at night,
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.140]   is making their symptoms worse.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.580]   And keep in mind, they couldn't completely control this,
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.960]   but this is largely independent
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.620]   of things like sleep duration.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.340]   So that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:33.420]   that the person sleeping less,
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.700]   although in a manic episode, presumably they are,
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.460]   it's independent of exercise.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.160]   It's independent of a bunch of other things,
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.320]   because any logical person will hear this and say,
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.880]   "Okay, well, they're getting more light at night
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.500]   because they're doing a bunch of other things."
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.760]   But it's largely independent of those other things.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.860]   Likewise, the symptomology of PTSD gets far worse
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.380]   with increasing light exposure at night.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.380]   Self-harm really takes a leap from being fairly,
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.620]   I don't want to say minimal,
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.660]   at the second and third quartile,
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.380]   so low in, let's say, medium.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.400]   I'm using some, I'm taking some liberties here,
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.460]   but low and medium amounts
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.580]   of artificial light exposure at night.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.480]   Then for people who get quite a lot
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.080]   of nighttime light exposure, self-harm goes up,
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.420]   and probability of psychotic episodes goes up,
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.680]   or psychotic symptoms.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.520]   Now, what's nice is that the,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.080]   what's nice about the data is that the exact inverse
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.400]   is basically true for daytime light exposure,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.580]   although not across the board.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.920]   We can generally say that for major depressive disorder,
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.420]   generalized anxiety, bipolar symptoms,
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.820]   there it's a little more scattered, PTSD, and self-harm,
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.020]   the more daytime light exposure, ideally from sunlight,
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.220]   'cause that's actually what's being measured in most cases,
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.020]   we can talk about how we know that,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   is going to approximately linearly drop the probability
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.380]   or the severity of these symptoms.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.620]   - And we could just explain again
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.300]   that the odds ratios now seem to be going down,
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:09.080]   so an odds ratio of 0.7 now refers to a 30% reduction
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.880]   in the variable of interest here.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.980]   - Exactly.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:16.060]   Now, the psychosis, panel F, which focuses on psychosis,
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:20.480]   I think is also worth mentioning in a bit more detail.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.600]   There's a fairly dramatic reduction in psychotic symptoms
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.060]   as one gets more daytime light exposure,
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.280]   independent of nighttime light exposure.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.800]   There's a well-known phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.440]   which is that people come into the hospital
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.580]   for a broken leg or a car accident,
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.900]   maybe they were getting surgery from Peter back when
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.900]   for something totally independent,
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.080]   they're housed in the hospital,
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.940]   and as anyone who's ever been in a hospital
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.740]   as a patient or visitor knows,
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.080]   the lighting environment of the hospital
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.980]   is absolutely dreadful for health, just dreadful.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.840]   I mean, people often complain about the food
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.180]   in the cafeteria as being unhealthy,
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.860]   that's often not always true, not always true,
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.860]   but the lighting environments in hospitals
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:06.780]   is absolutely counter to health.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.140]   - Especially in the intensive care unit, yeah.
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.060]   - Right, so--
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.140]   - I think the intensive care unit at Hopkins,
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:16.300]   the main one, the main ICU didn't have windows.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.500]   People who go into the hospital with a brain injury
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.280]   or with a stroke or something,
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.540]   I get contacted all the time,
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.540]   even though I'm not a clinician,
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.380]   what should I do for my kid, my parent?
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.060]   I always say, get them near a window
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.860]   and start to the best of your abilities
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.740]   controlling their sleep-wake cycle.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.480]   Now, oftentimes there are nurses coming in
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.580]   and taking blood tests and measuring pulses
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.740]   in the middle of the night, that's disruptive.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.460]   There's bright light, not just blue light,
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.540]   that's disruptive, it's noisy, that's disruptive.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.460]   ICU psychosis is when non-psychotic individuals
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:48.540]   start having psychotic episodes in the hospital
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.260]   because of nighttime light exposure
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.920]   and in some cases, lack of daytime sunlight.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.100]   We can say that with some degree of confidence
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.660]   because when those people go home,
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.540]   even though sometimes their symptoms
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.500]   for what brought them to the hospital
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:06.520]   in the first place get worse, their psychosis goes away.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.780]   Now, and it's independent of medication.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:12.860]   So let's just be really direct.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   There is a possibility that we are all socially jet-lagged,
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:23.860]   that we are all disrupting these mood regulation symptoms,
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:27.140]   the systems, excuse me, by not getting enough daytime light
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.720]   and by getting too much nighttime light.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.660]   If we want to look at just some of the bullet points
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.460]   or the takeaways, and Peter, thank you.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.080]   You highlighted a few of these, but--
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.940]   Can we just go back to this figure too for a second?
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:37.780]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.620]   There's a handful of things that really jumped out.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.760]   I had a feeling Peter was gonna want to dig in the day.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.140]   Yeah, yeah, I just-- Let's do it, let's do it.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.820]   And again, I normally wouldn't make so much hay out of this
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.860]   except for the fact that they're so tight.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.940]   But there are a few that really stand out.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.060]   And again, I love this figure.
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.600]   I would have labeled it a little differently
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.860]   to make it completely user-friendly.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:01.220]   But nevertheless, the increasing light at night
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.920]   and the impact on depression.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:06.240]   Let me be really technical in what I say.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.940]   And the relationship or correlation
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.600]   to depression is very strong.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.460]   The relationship to light and self-harm
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:19.420]   in the upper quartile, so when you take those 25% of people
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.860]   with the most nighttime light,
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.900]   that relationship to self-harm is interesting
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.820]   and completely uncoupled from the other 75%.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.140]   That's interesting.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.440]   By uncoupled, you mean that at the lower levels
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.420]   of light exposure at night,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.460]   you're not seeing an increase in self-harm.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.300]   Not whatsoever.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.080]   And then once you get to that fourth quartile--
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.920]   It's a big step.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.700]   It's like a 30% greater risk of self-harm.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.860]   Yeah, so it's totally flat.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.260]   The first, second, third quartile, no different.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.700]   And then fourth, big jump.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:48.220]   And then the inverse relationship, right?
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.100]   As light increases during the daytime,
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.680]   you see this reduction in self-harm.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.520]   Interesting.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.300]   The PTSD relationship based on nighttime light
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.020]   and the psychosis relationship based on daytime light.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.500]   Those are the ones that really jumped out to me.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:08.500]   I think anxiety relatively less impressive here.
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:13.060]   And bipolar disorder didn't seem as strong as well.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:16.740]   So I think those are the big ones that jumped out to me.
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.580]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.180]   There's a bit more scatter on generalized anxiety
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:25.180]   and the degree of significant change is not as robust.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:28.540]   In other words, getting a lot of daytime light,
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.500]   ideally from sunlight,
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.080]   is not necessarily going to reduce your levels of anxiety.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.340]   Getting a lot of nighttime light exposure
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.620]   is not increasing nighttime anxiety that much.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   Although 20% is not nothing for nighttime light exposure.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:49.580]   But yeah, the psychosis, major depression
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.060]   and self-harm are really, they leap out.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.360]   Actually, maybe we can just drill a little bit deeper
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.200]   on major depression.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.460]   And basically when you go from the second
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.600]   to third quartile of nighttime light exposure,
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.340]   so more than nighttime light exposure,
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.980]   you basically go from no significant increase
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.260]   to almost a 20% increase.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.780]   And then as you get up to the fourth quartile,
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.940]   so the most nighttime light exposure,
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.940]   you're at about 25% increase in major depressive symptoms.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.960]   That's no joke.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:24.240]   And I think that we, if we were to,
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.460]   I mean, we don't have the data right here,
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.060]   but if we were to look at like standard SSRI treatment
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.620]   for major depression, people debate this pretty actively.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:37.540]   But light is a very potent stimulus.
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.940]   And the timing of light is critical
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.300]   because on the inverse is also true.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.500]   As you get to the fourth quartile
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.180]   of daytime light exposure,
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.420]   you get about a 20% reduction in major depressive disorder.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.740]   What I like about a study like this
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.880]   is that it puts the error bars so easy to see on the data.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.100]   And why is that interesting?
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:01.100]   Well, there's a belief that daytime light exposure
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:06.580]   there's a belief that bigger is always better in sample size.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.140]   And we often talk about that
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.120]   through the lens of power analysis, right?
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   So how many subjects do we need to reach a conclusion
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.820]   that is powered to this level?
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.340]   And that's true, but what I don't think gets discussed
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.060]   as often is the opposite of that,
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.220]   which is what if you overpower a study?
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.620]   In other words, what if the power analysis says
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:34.860]   to have a level of power at 90%, you need a thousand subjects
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:38.960]   and you say, great, we're going to do 10,000 subjects.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.700]   Well, you're clearly powered for it,
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:42.020]   but you might be overpowered.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:44.420]   And people might say, well, why would that be a bad thing?
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.500]   It could be a bad thing because it means you are very likely
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.900]   to reach statistical significance
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.980]   in things that might not be actually significant.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:57.740]   And so one thing about this study that is just a quick back,
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.780]   like kind of a quick and dirty way to tell
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.100]   that it's probably not overpowered
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.540]   is that you have varying lengths of error bars.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:10.080]   And what that tells me is that, and again,
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.660]   this is not like a formal statistical analysis.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:13.900]   It's just kind of like a back
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.860]   of the envelope statistical analysis.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.660]   If you look, for example, at self-harm in the top quartile,
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.940]   you actually have pretty big error bars.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.820]   In fact, all the self-harm have sort
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.380]   of slightly bigger error bars.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.860]   And yet, when you look at, for example, the depression,
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.700]   even though the error bars aren't all the same size,
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:28.540]   they're tighter.
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.140]   In fact, when you look at the relationship
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.340]   between depression and daytime light,
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.300]   the error bars are really, really small.
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.680]   So that just gives me confidence
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.460]   that there is variability in this,
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.940]   which paradoxically you kind of want to see
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.900]   'cause it tells me that this wasn't just done,
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.120]   you know, there was, I think you said 8,000 subjects
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.860]   were in this, and I realized--
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.260]   - More than 86,000.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.220]   - 86,000, sorry.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.220]   Yeah, you realize that it wasn't that,
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.540]   oh, this should have been done with a 10th of that
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.380]   or a half of that.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:59.300]   And we're picking up signal that is statistically relevant,
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.200]   but clinically irrelevant.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.140]   - Yeah, thanks for that point.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:06.220]   I didn't pay attention to that.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.660]   I mean, I paid attention to the error bars,
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:08.900]   but I didn't know that.
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.760]   So thank you, I'm learning too.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.620]   And I suppose for people that are listening,
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.500]   we can just give them a sense
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.420]   of what the error bar ranges are.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:21.100]   For self-harm, they're running as much as 20%
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.420]   either side of the mean, the average.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.380]   And for major depression,
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:28.240]   it looks like it's more like, let's say eight to 10%.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.080]   - If that, yeah.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.120]   - If that, maybe more like five, right?
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.420]   So, yeah, I see what you're saying.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:38.420]   So when you get a very large sample size,
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.980]   you're going to have some outliers in there
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.760]   and you can mask those outliers
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.740]   just by having so many data points, right?
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.900]   - Yeah, because these error bars directly tell you
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.940]   whether or not you're statistically significant.
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:53.180]   So what's really nice about this type of graph,
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.500]   and you see these in,
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.900]   there's going to be a graph in my paper
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.520]   where you see the same analysis.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:01.740]   They're always drawing the 95% confidence interval
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.660]   on the data point.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.700]   And if the 95% confidence interval
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.740]   does not touch the line of unity,
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:14.160]   which in this case is the HODS ratio of 1.0 over the X-axis,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.040]   then you know it's statistically significant
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.720]   to the confidence interval they've defined,
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.700]   which is almost assuredly 95%.
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.780]   Sometimes they'll make it tighter at 99.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.920]   And so that's why you can just look right at these and go,
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.060]   oh, look, you know, in depression,
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:29.280]   the second quartile didn't reach statistical significance
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.460]   'cause the error bars are touching the line,
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.420]   just as the case for the second and third quartile
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.940]   for self-harm.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.720]   But when you look at the fourth quartile,
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.420]   you can see that the lower tip of the error bars
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.140]   isn't anywhere near unity.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.060]   And so we know without having to look up the P value
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.500]   that it's smaller than either 0.05 or 0.1,
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.900]   however they've defined it.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.600]   And it's really amazing when you see these
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.860]   overpowered studies,
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.720]   which are easier to do epidemiologically,
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.180]   where the P value ends up being microscopic.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.100]   They can drive their P values down to anything low
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.700]   because sample size can be infinite,
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:08.560]   but you can see that it's just like the error bar
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:13.240]   is just skimming above the unity line,
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.880]   but it's so, so, so tight.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.980]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.580]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Element.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.240]   Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.160]   and nothing you don't.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.500]   That means zero sugar
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.860]   and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte,
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.160]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.940]   And that correct ratio of electrolytes
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.100]   is extremely important because every cell in your body,
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.380]   but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.440]   relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.940]   So when you're well hydrated
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.820]   and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.680]   in your system, your mental functioning
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.760]   and your physical functioning is improved.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.620]   I drink one packet of Element dissolved
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.020]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.580]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.540]   as well as while I exercise.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.620]   And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.080]   I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.060]   in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.220]   Element comes in a variety of different flavors,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.180]   all of which I find really tasty.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.820]   I like the citrus, I like the watermelon,
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.900]   I like the raspberry.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.760]   Frankly, I can't pick just one.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.840]   It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint,
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.300]   which I find tastes best if they are put into water,
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.100]   dissolved, and then heated up.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.560]   I tend to do that in the winter months
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.020]   because, of course, you don't just need hydration
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.620]   on hot days and in the summer and spring months,
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.700]   but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.700]   and the environment tends to be dry.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.860]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.120]   you can go to Drink Element, spelled lment.com/huberman,
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.340]   to try a free sample pack.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.600]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.060]   One thing that I hope people are taking away from this study
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.500]   is that imagine you're somebody
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:50.340]   who has a very sensitive circadian mood system.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:54.660]   Well, that would mean you need less daytime light exposure
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.960]   to feel good or less bad,
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.160]   but it also means that you might need
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.960]   very little light at night
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.960]   in order to negatively impact your mood systems.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.440]   And in fact, they make this argument in the discussion
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.100]   as an interesting point that I think is worth mentioning,
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.140]   because here, again, what I like about this study
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:19.100]   is that they've separated day and nighttime light exposure.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.280]   Turns out that many of the drugs
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.500]   that are used to treat bipolar disorder
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.060]   reduce the sense, are effective,
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:30.820]   perhaps in part because they reduce the sensitivity
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:35.220]   of the light-sensing circadian apparati.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.740]   Now, that's interesting, right?
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.180]   If you think about this, okay,
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.780]   so these are drugs that can ameliorate
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.340]   some of the symptoms of bipolar,
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.600]   perhaps in part by reducing the extent
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.580]   to which nighttime light exposure
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.760]   can relieve bipolar symptoms,
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.180]   excuse me, can exacerbate bipolar symptoms.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.720]   Conversely, there's evidence
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.640]   that people who take certain antidepressants
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.120]   may suppress the ability for daytime light
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.780]   to positively impact the mood systems of the brain.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.400]   Now, of course, we don't want people halting their medication
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.720]   on the basis of that statement alone, please don't,
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.840]   talk to your psychiatrist.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.740]   But if we know one thing for sure,
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.700]   it's that if you want a significant outcome
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.700]   and a paper as a scientist, give a drug, any drug,
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:25.460]   and look at the amount of rapid eye movement,
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.200]   sleep, or the circadian cycle,
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.900]   pretty much any drug alters the circadian rhythm
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:32.540]   for better or worse.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.900]   But if we start to think about which medications
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.540]   might adjust our overall sensitivity to light,
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.780]   sometimes this could be a good thing.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.160]   You think less sensitivity to light,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.960]   well, for people who have bipolar disorder,
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.640]   the amount of daytime light exposure
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.400]   isn't that important for their overall mood regulation,
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.440]   but the amount of nighttime light exposure really is.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.640]   In other words, darkness for eight hours every night
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.260]   should be viewed, in my opinion,
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.560]   as a treatment for bipolar disorder, not the only treatment.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.100]   But it's also clear that we should all be avoiding
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.200]   really bright, extensive really bright
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.280]   nighttime light exposure.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.500]   I mean, if anything, you know,
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.260]   my takeaway from this study is that darkness at night
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.620]   is the fourth key light stimulus.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.540]   Now, a couple of things, very bright moonlight,
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.380]   very bright candlelight is probably only like,
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.460]   gosh, three to 50 lux.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.300]   What?
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:29.780]   When you go outside on a brightly lit full moon night,
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.780]   I encourage people to download this free app,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.860]   I have no relationship to it, called Light Meter,
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.440]   and it gives you a pretty good read
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.460]   of what the lux are in that environment.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.180]   By the way, a lot of people don't realize this,
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.520]   they think you just tap the button
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.420]   and then it tells you how many lux, you hold it down,
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.220]   it's kind of fun, you can scan around the room
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.080]   and see how many lux are on average
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.100]   coming from that location or outside.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.220]   Go out on a really bright moonlit night.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.580]   - I mean, we should have a full moon tonight.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.900]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.620]   You're not gonna get above 100 lux.
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.460]   - That's incredible.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.100]   - You're sitting at a candlelight dinner
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.920]   with your spouse or with friends,
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.100]   and it's clearly bright enough to see them.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:06.860]   Put that lux meter right up, not too close to the flame,
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.860]   50 to 200 lux.
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.580]   Maybe 400 lux. - I had an interesting
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.860]   experience a couple of months ago on an elk hunt
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.860]   where it was a full moon,
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.700]   which actually makes the hunting not so great,
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.100]   but it was the first time I've ever noticed
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:24.180]   my shadow in relation to the moon.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.580]   That's how bright it seemed the light was.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.100]   - This is Halloween appropriate.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Since we're coming up,
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.620]   we're recording this close to Halloween.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:34.260]   - So, super interesting to think it could be that dim.
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.680]   - Campfire, you know, and firelight,
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.320]   you think, okay, gathering around a campfire,
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.500]   well then, okay, you know, everyone's circadian rhythm
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.060]   must have been disrupted for ages
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.980]   before the development of electricity.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.940]   No, no, those campfires are extremely bright,
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:51.340]   but they're not that bright
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.900]   compared to a very densely overcast day.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.020]   - And what is your phone
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:05:00.020]   if you don't use any sort of light mitigating tech on it?
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.740]   - Well, distance matters.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.220]   - But at the distance we're holding it?
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.960]   - Yeah, so with all the wavelengths cranked up,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.360]   so there is a nice feature intrinsic to the phone
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.920]   where you can eliminate the blues at night
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.320]   or, you know, this kind of thing,
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.280]   but if you crank it up to maximum light intensity,
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.240]   probably something like, you know, 500 to 1000 lux.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.560]   Now, keep in mind though, it's additive, right?
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.800]   So it's over time.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.680]   So lux is a measure of,
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.000]   I think it relates back to candelas
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.120]   is the amount of light shown,
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:35.080]   and I think it's like the one meter away
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.260]   and there's a squaring and a falling off of distance.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.580]   We can look it up.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.780]   These are old school measurements converted to lux,
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.740]   but keep in mind that if you're looking at your phone
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.480]   or tablet at 800 lux or 500 lux in the evening,
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.080]   and you do that for two hours,
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.880]   well, you're summing quite a lot of photons.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.680]   Now it is true, and I do want to be fair to the biology,
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.220]   and it'd be dishonest to say anything different.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.820]   You know, we've hammered on people
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.100]   about not shifting their circadian rhythm with light at night
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.260]   but we know that the middle of the day
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.020]   and the middle of the night are circadian dead zones.
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.020]   You can't shift your circadian rhythm that well
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.460]   in the middle of the day, in the middle of the night,
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.220]   but you can provide a wake up signal
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.480]   for your body and brain.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.660]   It's really that sunrise and sunset that are critical.
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.720]   That's why I said there are four things,
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.200]   see sunrise or sun rising.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.500]   You don't need to see across the horizon.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.280]   Sunset, bright light during the day,
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.060]   minimize light exposure at night,
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:29.220]   and you don't need pitch black.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.060]   In fact, pitch black probably just increases
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.060]   the frequency of injury.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.220]   You know, I get up in the middle of the night,
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.820]   use the bathroom probably once, I think it's normal.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.380]   I go back to sleep.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.140]   You know, if it were pitch black, I'd probably injure myself.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.780]   So just dim it down.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.580]   Some people use red lights, you know,
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.180]   our friend Rick Rubin-- - Our mutual friend.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.780]   - Yeah, Rick Rubin is--
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.060]   - Can we tell a funny story about Rick?
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.540]   - Yeah, of course, of course.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.380]   - You know this story, but just in case Rick's listening,
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.540]   he'll appreciate this.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.600]   You know, when Rick was here staying last summer,
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.300]   he's up in our guest house and he came down
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.300]   after the first night and he was like unacceptable.
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:04.140]   You know what I'm talking about, right?
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.580]   - Yeah, unacceptable accommodations.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.780]   - What did he do?
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:10.340]   - He removed all the lighting that existed in that room
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.340]   and replaced it with red light bulbs,
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.380]   which I later used when I stayed here
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.580]   and then later stole when I left.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:19.820]   The teenage me, I took them.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.860]   I took them, that's why Derek, when he stayed here,
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.380]   Elaine or anyone else, he stayed here.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.920]   Conti or anyone else didn't have those.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.300]   I took them, I love them.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.320]   - So funny.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.780]   Jill is like, you know Rick changed every light
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.360]   in the guest house to red?
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.340]   I'm like, yeah, no, I didn't know that,
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.300]   but I'm not surprised.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.420]   - Yeah, well in his place,
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.860]   he has mostly either no lighting or red lighting.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.760]   So during the day, he just goes by ambient light
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.820]   and then red light in the evening or candlelight.
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:47.700]   And it's great.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.060]   And you know, people hear red lights
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:49.940]   and they think they have to buy
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.580]   these expensive red light units,
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.220]   but that's not what we're talking about.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:56.780]   You can literally buy red party lights or just a red bulb.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.920]   Some people say, well, can I just use a red film
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.420]   or can I put a t-shirt over the lamp?
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.260]   I worry about people putting t-shirts over lamps
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.620]   because of the fire hazard.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:07.820]   But I'll be honest, I dim the lights in my home at night.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.060]   When I travel, sometimes I will bring one of the stolen
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.820]   from Rick Rubin red lights.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.380]   - The Rick Rubin's dash.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.780]   Here's something where I've sort of softened my tune.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.500]   So I used to be kind of a hard liner,
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.980]   no blue light in the evening guy, you know,
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.900]   had the, you know, everything was red light at night
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.780]   as far as my phone using flux on the computer,
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.020]   you know, whatever it was.
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:36.060]   I suspect that that matters somewhat,
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.860]   but I think what matters more is the stimulation
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.540]   that may come from those things.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:44.800]   And what I've come to realize, at least in me,
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.180]   which means it probably is true in others as well,
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.820]   and at least some others,
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:53.620]   is that what I'm doing on my phone matters more
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.580]   than how bright my phone is.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.460]   In other words, if I've got the best blue light filter
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.780]   in the world on my phone,
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.460]   but I'm doom scrolling social media
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.820]   and getting lit up on email,
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:07.020]   that's way worse for me
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:10.660]   than if I've got my phone on maximum light
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:15.660]   and I'm like watching YouTube videos of F1 cars
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.280]   and driving around having fun.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.260]   Like, it's a totally different experience.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.380]   So the context matters.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.880]   And I think for that reason,
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.220]   I would want people to be mindful of the whole picture.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.260]   You know, going to bed under a period of, you know,
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:35.440]   intense duress brought on by something, you know,
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.380]   that's an equally dangerous component to all of this.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.480]   That's distinct from what we're talking about.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.760]   But, you know, I want people to be able to think of this
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.920]   in the context of everything.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.500]   - Yeah, it's a really important point.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.580]   One thing I'll say is that if you're going to stay up
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.060]   past your normal bedtime,
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.020]   if you're going to get a lot of light in your eyes,
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.820]   I would hope that it would be for fun reasons
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.060]   and for reasons you enjoy.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.600]   You should definitely spend some nights out.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.800]   You should definitely do some all-nighters studying
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.720]   if you really, you know,
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.520]   if it's going to help you get the grade that's permanent.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.740]   Right, I'd certainly have done all-nighters studying
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:09.220]   and grant writing for years.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.820]   You know, there are going to be the inevitable all-nighters
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.520]   due to, God forbid, a trip to the hospital
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.540]   or you heard something on the news that really amped you up
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.740]   or you just simply can't sleep.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.620]   That stuff is going to happen.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.020]   So I think the goal should be
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.500]   to minimize light exposure at night.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.420]   And I think what you just said is especially true
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.460]   because we don't know, for instance,
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.540]   people talk about the negative impact of social media.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.220]   Is it the fact that people are looking at this little box
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.540]   for so many hours per day?
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.340]   Is it all the things they're not doing?
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.100]   Is it what they're looking at per se?
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.700]   All of those things interact and are really important.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.980]   We know based on studies from the Stanford Sleep Lab
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.780]   that if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.780]   looking at what time it is can be very disruptive
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:51.900]   to your ability to fall back asleep
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.780]   and to your sense the next day.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.300]   It's a placebo effect, but it's a powerful one
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.100]   of how tired you are the next day.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.460]   They've done this where they wake people up
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.500]   in the middle of the night and then they say it's 4 a.m.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.580]   versus 2 a.m. versus 6 a.m.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.700]   And people's perceived levels of energy during the day
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.900]   in some ways correlate with what they think,
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.020]   how much sleep they think they got.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.940]   Likewise, and this is one of the concerns,
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.380]   potential concerns with sleep trackers.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.020]   Allie Crum talked about this when she came on our podcast.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.900]   If people see a poor sleep score,
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.180]   they often feel worse than if they see a good sleep score.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.900]   Now, of course, physiology matters.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:31.140]   You can't lie to yourself and say you got a great night's
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.720]   sleep simply by virtue of a sleep score.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.460]   But I worry more about the false,
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.020]   well, if it's a false negative,
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.800]   that we don't wanna put valence on this.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.700]   Seeing a bad sleep score and then deciding
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.900]   that you're gonna have a terrible day.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.660]   I think a bad sleep score is an indication
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.580]   that you might need to dial some things in a bit better.
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.340]   Getting a great sleep score is an indication
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.060]   that you might be doing a number of things right
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.180]   and start looking at these things as averages.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.020]   Would you agree?
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:55.860]   - Yeah, completely.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.240]   I don't think it's that different from CGM, right?
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.260]   Like I think that CGM is an amazing tool to provide insight.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.140]   And you pretty much know the insights
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.380]   after a relatively short period of time.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.980]   30 days, maybe at the outside 90
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.020]   for a person with a very complicated life.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.260]   And you know all you need to know
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.860]   about how the inputs affect the output.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.040]   Thereafter, if you choose to use it, it's a behavioral tool.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.580]   In other words, you're using this
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.340]   to build in a Hawthorne effect.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.340]   I think the same is largely true with sleep trackers.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.720]   Most people have this profound sense of learning
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.180]   when they first encounter one of these things.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.780]   And it's again, you've heard it all a hundred times.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:37.020]   Oh my God, I can't believe what alcohol does to my sleep.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.140]   - Or caloric trackers.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:38.980]   - Exactly.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:41.200]   - Like I think a Lane Norton's app, Carbon,
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.360]   I have no financial relationship to it.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.060]   I use it and it's taught me, wow,
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.880]   like I consume a lot of calories
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.980]   in the form of certain things at certain times of day.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.860]   And there's just a lot of good learning in that.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.560]   - But it's the act of tracking that helps you manage it.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.020]   And similarly, I think it's the act of knowing
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.600]   you're gonna be looking at that score that gamifies it,
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.700]   that kind of helps people do the right things.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.540]   Oh, you know what?
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.340]   I'm not gonna have that drink tonight,
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.620]   or I'm not gonna eat that snack before bed
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.980]   because I've now been conditioned
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.420]   to see how that impacts score.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.680]   That said, I think that, you know,
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.740]   recovery scores and things like that
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:20.260]   are just notoriously poor at predicting performance.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:23.060]   And I think there's a reason that serious athletes
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.100]   would never use things like that.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.920]   They would tend to rely on the more tried and true methods
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.100]   of predicting behaviors, such as heart rate,
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.480]   maybe heart rate variability,
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.840]   but morning resting heart rate,
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.700]   probably more predictive than anything else.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.520]   And then, you know, in workout things such as heart rate,
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.680]   heart rate recovery, lactate threshold, things like that.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.380]   So yeah, I agree.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.480]   I think we have to, and I say this as a guy
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.420]   who's generally perceived to be the most pro-device guy
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.180]   in the world, people would be surprised
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:54.320]   how sparingly I use things like that.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.860]   - I mean, I do some tracking, not as much as you.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:02.760]   I love things that seem to work the first time
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.580]   and every time in terms of our natural biology,
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.680]   based on a couple of criteria.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.380]   There's an established mechanism.
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:12.460]   It's been explored in the context of pathology,
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.860]   like mental health disorders,
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:17.940]   as well as pro-health in healthy individuals.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.620]   That it make really good sense
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:23.820]   at the level of kind of wellness
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:26.660]   and let's just say ancient health.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.340]   You know, when you talk about getting a lot of sunlight
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.080]   during the day, like a lot of people will say,
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.260]   well, of course, get outside and play.
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.940]   Not getting too much light at night.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.740]   Of course, this is just good old quote unquote,
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.760]   good old fashioned advice.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.680]   People spend 90% of their time indoors now.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.380]   Their daytime environments are too dim.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.860]   Their nighttime environments are too bright.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:50.820]   And this kind of misleading aspect of artificial light
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.460]   that when you see a bright bulb,
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.320]   you think I'm getting a lot of photons
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.940]   is part of the problem.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.420]   And the fact that when you're out on an overcast day
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.280]   and it, you know, you think there's sun,
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.940]   quote unquote, isn't out.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.820]   Well, it's hidden by cloud cover,
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.460]   but just think about how well you can navigate
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.380]   that environment without a flashlight
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:13.780]   versus at night where you would require a flashlight.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.420]   We evolved under this traumatic difference
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:20.060]   in day/night availability of photons,
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.420]   independent of whether or not you can quote see the sun.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:27.540]   And it's just very clear that all the mechanisms
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.380]   in our brain and body that regulate mood
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.580]   are just powerfully regulated by this stuff.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.980]   So I've made it a point to really reduce
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.260]   the amount of nighttime light that I'm getting,
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:39.060]   but I'm less concerned about flipping on the light switch
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.140]   to use the bathroom as I used to be.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.420]   I used to think, oh, I'm like quashing all my melatonin.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.000]   This is terrible.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.980]   I know I can't shift my circadian clock then.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.460]   I know that that light, yes, while it's bright,
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.740]   if it's brief, I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.900]   Would it be better to have a, you know,
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.840]   a dim light on as opposed to a bright light?
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.340]   Sure, but I'm not gonna stress it in a hotel bathroom
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.180]   or something.
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.800]   I'm not gonna walk around, you know, shielding my eyes.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.700]   So people sometimes ask me, by the way,
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.140]   is it different to look at the phone directly
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.060]   versus if you tilt the phone away?
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.400]   Well, it absolutely is.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.540]   I mean, think about a flashlight shown on the ground
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.580]   in front of you.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.860]   Very few photons getting in your eyes
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.600]   versus shown directly in your eyes.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.980]   Think about ambient light from the sun going everywhere
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.480]   versus looking in the general direction of the sun.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.820]   So east in the morning, west in the afternoon, of course.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.980]   The directionality of the light matters.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.300]   So I'm not saying it, you know,
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.460]   that you need to like peek at your phone
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.580]   as if you're looking, you know,
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.260]   over the edge of a bowl or something into it.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:36.140]   But my friend, Samir Hattaru,
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.320]   who's head of the chronobiology unit at the National
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.860]   Institutes of Mental Health,
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.340]   we used to room together at meetings.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:43.440]   We stopped 'cause he's a terrible snorer.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.980]   So I just could, there were a few times
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.420]   when I considered suffocating him in the middle of the night
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.000]   since he was already suffocating himself.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.960]   Now we just, we don't stay in the same rooms anymore.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.600]   We're no longer postdocs.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.540]   But I caught him looking at his phone
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.440]   in the middle of the night and he would tilt it like away,
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.040]   like he's holding a platter for those
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.200]   that are just listening and kind of like looking over
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.600]   at the screen there and like, what are you doing?
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.440]   This is ridiculous.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.320]   I'm trying not to get so much light in my eyes.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.960]   That's a little extreme, but I think it illustrates the point
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.640]   which is how much direct light exposure
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.900]   you get at night matters.
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:15.960]   How much direct sunlight exposure you get,
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.000]   especially early in late, early morning, late afternoon
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.980]   and throughout the day, it really matters.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:21.960]   - Now remind me, Andrew,
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.740]   what is the wavelength of sunlight?
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.520]   - Great, so sunlight is going to include all visible,
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.400]   visible spectrum, right? - Which runs from how many?
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.040]   - Yeah, so, well, let's, let's,
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.280]   we can answer two questions there.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.080]   This wrist sensor detected 470 degree,
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.440]   70 nanometer to 650 nanometer light.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.500]   So that's going to be blue and ultraviolet.
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.340]   Ultraviolet's kind of-
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:45.000]   - Yeah, that's kind of like blue to orange.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.600]   - Yeah, blue, blue to orange.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.960]   That's what this was measuring.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.500]   So red light is going to be more like 680.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.320]   Far red is getting out to 7720 and up, upwards of that.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.940]   Blue light is going to fall somewhere in the low fours.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.700]   Ultraviolet is getting down into the high threes
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.900]   and, and lower.
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.860]   And so these, these spectra of light.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.720]   So during the day, you know, midday light,
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.980]   you're getting what looks like white light.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.220]   You'll see, oh, the sky's blue
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.220]   and the sun is bright white light.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.260]   It's not even yellow to your eye.
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:14.540]   And of course don't stare at it,
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.380]   especially in the middle of the day.
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:18.800]   You're getting all visible spectra.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.360]   So you're getting everything from UV
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.020]   all the way out to red light.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:24.100]   It's just coming in at equal intensities.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.280]   - So is that a potential limitation of this study
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.940]   in that it didn't have a sensor that could pick up
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.520]   the full spectrum of light?
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.300]   - Potentially, especially since they're, you know,
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.240]   we don't think of humans as UV capable.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.480]   Like we can't perceive UV light.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.240]   Like a ground squirrel for instance can,
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.080]   has UV sensors in its eyes.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.120]   Turns out, you know why they use this, it's crazy.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.480]   They actually, you know, when the ground squirrels sit up
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.720]   on their haunches, they're actually signaling one another.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.840]   They rub urine on their belly and it reflects UV.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:57.220]   The New York Times for some reason has been running
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:01.620]   a series of papers or articles rather about
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.120]   naturally occurring fluorescence at night
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.180]   and all sorts of these scorpions and monotremes
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:08.480]   like the platypus.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.000]   No one really knows the reason for these odd,
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.100]   odd wavelength of light emissions for all these animals.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.820]   But you know, we view things in the blue, violet
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.800]   and up to red and you know, we're not pit vipers.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.580]   We can't see far red, but we can see lower than 470 nanometers
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.160]   and we can see higher than 650.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.060]   - Is there a technology reason why they had such a narrow
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.120]   band in these sensors?
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.180]   Is it not possible that they could have used a wrist sensor
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.880]   that was wider?
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.560]   - This study was initiated in 2013.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:42.360]   The tech was probably far worse than it is now.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.180]   Again, I would love for somebody to design an eyeglass
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.480]   where it's measuring how many photons you're getting
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.600]   across the day.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.520]   I'm not a big fan of having everything be amplified.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.220]   So I would love it if the frame would just shift color
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:57.060]   across the morning.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.700]   Like you go outside on a cloudy day, you know,
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.240]   you wear these glasses and by the way,
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.020]   it's fine to wear eyeglasses or contacts
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:06.100]   for sunlight viewing for setting your circadian rhythm.
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.000]   People always say, well, why is that okay
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:08.840]   when a window's not?
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.060]   Well, corrective lenses are actually focusing the light
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.100]   onto your retina.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.000]   The windows and windshields are scattering the light
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.840]   and filtering.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.380]   - And how much are sunglasses filtering this out?
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.760]   - Way too much.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.100]   We can safely say way too much.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:26.100]   Probably causing a tenfold decrement in the total lux count
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.060]   that's landing on your retina.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.200]   But of course, you know, sunglasses are important
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.140]   driving into sun and some people have very sensitive eyes.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.760]   I can't sit at a cafe with a bright,
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.460]   brightly reflective table in the afternoon.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.100]   I just squint like crazy.
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:41.940]   I can't do it.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.560]   My dad who's, you know, darker eyed
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.780]   and, you know, he's South American descent.
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:48.620]   He, you know, he can just sit there just fine.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:50.780]   My mom who's got light eyes like me, you know,
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.140]   we're like, ah, it's really tough.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.600]   We just have a terrible time.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.900]   You know, people differ in their light sensitivity.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:02.300]   - So there's one other macro question I have here
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.820]   and it's not answerable because without randomization
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.380]   we can't know it.
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:12.220]   But it's the question of how much reverse causality
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.460]   can exist in these observations.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:18.100]   So again, these observations demonstrate
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:21.180]   very tight correlations, very strong associations,
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.680]   especially in the five areas that we highlighted.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:30.220]   But it's possible that part of what we're seeing
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:35.180]   is reverse causality brought on by both the treatments
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.780]   which you've already kind of alluded to
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.620]   and also the condition itself.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.580]   - You want to explain reverse causality for people
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:43.480]   and maybe could you mention for those that missed
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.700]   the Hawthorne effect just 'cause you, yeah.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:50.700]   - Yeah, the Hawthorne effect is an effect that is named
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.780]   after an observation of what took place in a factory
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.380]   where they were actually studying worker productivity
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.580]   with light of all things.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.940]   But what it refers to is the idea that people
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.260]   will change their behavior when they are observed.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:09.460]   So if I said, well, I really want to know
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.380]   what a day in the life is like for Andrew Huberman,
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.720]   I'm going to follow him around for a day.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.620]   It's very unlikely that his behavior that day
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.500]   will be exactly as it was if I wasn't there.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.580]   And so the reason-- - Which is why you probably
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.480]   will never see a day in the life of Andrew Huberman.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.380]   Although it's pretty scripted unless I'm traveling.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.860]   It's morning sunlight, hydration and some cardio
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.420]   or weight training and then a lot of time reading papers.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.740]   It'd be the most boring video in the world
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:39.060]   'cause it's mostly me reading and underlining things.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:43.920]   - But it's why gamifying things can be beneficial, right?
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.460]   It's why a CGM can be beneficial
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.860]   because it's sort of like somebody's watching you
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.080]   and you're going to modify what you eat in response to it
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.040]   or why tracking can really be an effective way
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.060]   to reduce input because there's a sense of being monitored
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.260]   by doing that, especially if someone literally monitors it.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.720]   In other words, you can set up an accountability partner
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.280]   where your health coach or someone
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.060]   is actually seeing the data.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:08.300]   So that's what it is.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.500]   Now, as far as reverse causality,
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.960]   when you look at variables,
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.960]   so let's just pick a common one that's unrelated to this.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:23.240]   So there's an association that more diet soda consumption
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.380]   is associated with greater obesity.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.700]   It's a bit paradoxical, right?
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.540]   - Is that true?
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:32.780]   - It is, yeah, it's been demonstrated in many series
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:36.100]   that the greater the consumption of diet soda,
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:39.300]   the greater the prevalence of obesity.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.740]   And that has been postulated by some to suggest
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:44.800]   that non-nutritive sweeteners,
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.580]   such as aspartame or sucralose or things like that,
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:50.300]   are actually part of what's causing obesity.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:54.660]   And while there are probably some arguments you could make
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.420]   around the impact that those things might have
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.540]   on the gut microbiome,
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.780]   and maybe there's some way and that's happening,
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.300]   it's also equally likely, if not probably more likely,
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.980]   that there's reverse causality there.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:08.640]   That a person who is obese is therefore contemplating
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.300]   how much they're eating or thinking,
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.380]   hey, what's an easy way that I can reduce calories?
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:16.700]   How about instead of drinking a Coke, I drink a Diet Coke?
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:20.780]   And so there, the causality which you would impute to mean
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.220]   the drink is causing the obesity,
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:26.440]   it might be, no, the obesity is causing the choice of drink.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.560]   So here, the question is,
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:32.180]   how much of the effect we're seeing
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:36.120]   is a result of the condition that's being studied, right?
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:40.960]   How much of the disruption in both day and night,
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.040]   light exposure is the result of the depression?
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.920]   It's dysregulating the sleep.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.820]   Maybe they're sleeping more during the day
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:50.280]   and more awake at night because of depression.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.600]   Again, these are, you can't know this.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.960]   This is where epidemiology never allows us to determine this.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.800]   And sadly, these questions can only be answered
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.880]   through either direct randomization
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.660]   or Mendelian randomization,
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.460]   which by the way, I was going to also ask you,
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.780]   do you know if anyone has examined this
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.860]   from a Mendelian standpoint?
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.080]   That would be very interesting
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.940]   'cause I have to believe, well, it would be interesting.
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.400]   I don't know enough about the biology
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:20.340]   to know what SNPs would be studyable,
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.020]   but that would be interesting.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.500]   - What Peter is saying is, you know,
[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:27.000]   if you knew something about the genomes of these people,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.500]   you would be in a great position to perhaps even link up
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.800]   light susceptibility genes or like sensitivity genes
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.480]   with genes for, you know,
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.160]   pathways involved in major depression, bipolar.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.200]   I mean, getting to this issue of reverse causality,
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.840]   I mean, I think it's very straightforward to imagine
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.200]   that the person who's experiencing a manic episode
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.600]   is going to be up for two weeks at a time, sadly,
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.940]   and getting a lot of nighttime light exposure.
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.200]   You know, now nighttime dark exposure
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.280]   as a treatment for bipolar
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.440]   is something that people are starting to talk about.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.300]   So making sure that even those people are awake,
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:07.020]   that they're at least blue blocking at night,
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.520]   reducing their online activities,
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.360]   but people with severe manic episodes
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.800]   have a hard time regulating their own behavior, of course.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.880]   - And it's not one or the other.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.900]   Like, I don't want the question to come across
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:19.640]   to the listener that it has to be one or the other.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.140]   It's only A can cause B or B can cause A.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.360]   No, it's actually,
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.120]   a lot of times these things feed off each other.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.120]   Going back to the soda example,
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.440]   I actually think there's a bit of both, right?
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.020]   I actually think there's a real clear body habitus
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:35.920]   dictates beverage choice,
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.280]   but I also am starting to think
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.720]   that in susceptible individuals,
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.200]   non-nutritive sweeteners will alter the gut biome
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.360]   and that alters metabolism.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.720]   - What about just hunger?
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.160]   I remember Lane telling me,
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:54.580]   and I've seen at least one of the studies that, you know,
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:57.560]   water is probably better for us than diet soda,
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.400]   but that for some people,
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:03.600]   diet soda is a great tool for reducing caloric intake.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.880]   I also know some individuals, not me, who drink diet soda.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.780]   I drink diet soda from time to time,
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:11.320]   mainly Stevia sweetened sodas,
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.140]   but what I'm referring to here are people besides myself
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.560]   who drink diet soda and it seems to stimulate their appetite.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.840]   There's something about the perception of sweet
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.520]   as driving hunger, whereas not eating,
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.080]   or drinking anything with any sweetness
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:29.920]   doesn't seem to.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.000]   This is one of the things I wonder if it impacts
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.520]   why some people like intermittent fasting,
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.160]   because for some people, you know,
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.720]   just even the perception,
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.800]   I wonder if the perception of sweetness
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.160]   or even just the smell of food we know
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.280]   can stimulate appetite.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.580]   So you can mention the perception of sweetness in the mouth,
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.520]   even if there's no calories there.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.680]   I don't think it necessarily makes people hypoglycemic,
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.800]   but perhaps it makes them think about,
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.160]   hmm, like sweet means food.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.440]   For instance, for years, I loved the combination
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.160]   of a diet Coke and a slice of pizza
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.040]   whenever I was in New York, ideally two slices of pizza.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.000]   So now every time I have a diet Coke,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.720]   which isn't that often, but I like diet Coke,
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.720]   especially with a little bit of lemon in it,
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.960]   I just think about a slice of cheese
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.800]   or mushroom or pepperoni pizza.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.440]   It's like, I want it, I crave it more.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.020]   So there's a paired association there that I think is real.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:22.080]   And we know based on Dana Small's lab at Yale,
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.740]   that there's this paired association
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:26.860]   between the sweetness from sucralose
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.800]   and that there's an insulin response.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.620]   They actually had to cease the study in kids
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.980]   because they were becoming pre-diabetic,
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:36.260]   which unfortunately meant the study was never published.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.800]   Have you talked to Dana on this podcast?
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.760]   No, we wrote a premium newsletter on this
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.920]   several months ago.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:47.920]   It's gotta be like, I don't know, 10 to 20,000 words
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.040]   on all things related to sugar substitutes.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:51.880]   Okay, I'll read that.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.840]   So yeah, folks who are interested in this topic,
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.700]   I would refer them to the premium newsletter
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:57.580]   on sugar substitutes.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:00.120]   I think it was our September edition.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.700]   The short of it is the data are a little bit noisy,
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:08.560]   but there is indeed some sweeteners in some studies
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.740]   do result in that phenomenon.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:13.040]   You described the cephalic insulin response.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.820]   And I came away from the research that went into that,
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:22.280]   which was a Herculean effort on the part of the team.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   A little bit more confused than when I went in,
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.360]   but being even more cautious around artificial sweeteners
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.440]   than I was going in.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.160]   And not for the reasons that I don't necessarily,
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.440]   I didn't find any evidence
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.980]   that these things are cancer causing, right?
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.720]   So that's the headline stuff people worry about.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.560]   You have to ingest like 10 grams or something crazy.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   I came away more confident
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.760]   that from a long-term safety perspective,
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:55.000]   in terms of cancer and catastrophic outcomes like that,
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.080]   that wasn't the issue.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.480]   But I came away much more cautious
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.920]   around these things can really be mucking around
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.320]   with both your brain chemistry and your gut chemistry,
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.320]   which can pertain to your metabolism.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:11.120]   And therefore my takeaway was buyer beware,
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.980]   use limited amounts only.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:15.000]   The one, by the way,
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.760]   that still emerged to me as a reasonable one,
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.120]   it's the only one that I use
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.120]   and I've talked about it a lot is Xylitol.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.880]   Xylitol is the, pardon me, I shouldn't say it,
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.880]   Xylitol for chewing, so for gum and Allulose as an additive.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.800]   So those were the-
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.640]   - Safer, you're saying?
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.920]   - Yes, those are basically the only two I will consume.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.680]   - I'll drink a Diet Coke every now and again,
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.300]   if I'm on a plane or something.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.160]   You know, this law that got passed a few years ago,
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.680]   you couldn't bring liquids of your own
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.360]   into the airport and onto the plane.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.960]   Like what a great- - A few years ago.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.440]   - What a great scheme.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.120]   What a great scheme to get people
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.320]   to buy overpriced fluids in the airport.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.920]   Like, I mean, there are more important issues in the world,
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.560]   but like this one really gets me.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.720]   But yeah, I use a little bit,
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.280]   I drink things with a little bit of Stevia in it,
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:09.280]   the occasional Diet Coke and I generally avoid sucralose.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.920]   I don't like the way it tastes, monk fruit's too sweet,
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.640]   but yeah, maybe we'll do a podcast on that in the future.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.480]   Okay, so I think we can wrap this paper 'cause I really-
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.560]   - Well, but tell me what you think about that point, Andrew.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.080]   Like how, I mean, you know more about this stuff than I do,
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:30.040]   but if you had to just lay on your judgment, right?
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.960]   So if it were 100 to zero, you would say,
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:38.960]   the light is 100% causal in the effects we're seeing.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:42.200]   If it were zero to 100, you'd say, nope,
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:47.040]   the behavior is 100% causal of the exposure to light.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.680]   Where do you, again, you can't know it.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.880]   What does your intuition tell you?
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.980]   - Okay, there's my intuition
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.800]   and then there's my recognition of my own bias
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:59.800]   because I started working on these circadian pathways
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.400]   originating in the eye back in the year in '98
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.760]   as a graduate student at Berkeley.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:07.400]   The cells, these melanopsin intrinsically sensitive
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.840]   retinal ganglion cells were discovered in the early 2000s
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.120]   by a guy named Iggy Provencio, Dave Burson,
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.760]   Sam Rattar, Sachin Pant, and others.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.540]   And it was one of the most important discoveries
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:18.640]   in all of biology, clearly.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:22.280]   So I've been very excited about these systems,
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:27.200]   but if I set that aside, so bias disclosure made,
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.700]   I think 65 to 75% of the effects
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.280]   are likely due to light directly.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.880]   Now it's impossible to tease those apart, as you mentioned,
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:43.120]   but to play devil's advocate against myself,
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.020]   you know, you could imagine that the depressed individual
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:49.260]   is laying around indoors with the curtains drawn.
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:50.860]   They didn't sleep well the night before,
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.480]   which gives you a photo sensitivity that isn't pleasant.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.320]   Like it sucks to have bright light in your eyes
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.560]   first thing in the morning, especially if you didn't sleep
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.660]   well, and then they're, you know, making their coffee
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.320]   in a dimly lit, what they think is brightly lit environment.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.040]   And then they're, you're looking at their phone
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.060]   and the state of the world sucks
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:11.660]   and their state of their internal landscape is rough.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:16.040]   And they're, maybe they're dealing with a pain or,
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.560]   or, you know, an injury or something.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.080]   And their likelihood of getting outside is low.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.960]   And when they do get outside, they're going to shuffle
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.440]   and not, you know, so I could see how the behaviors
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.960]   could really limit the amount of light exposure.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.760]   And then evening rolls around, they've been tired all day
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.980]   and a common symptom of depression, you fall asleep.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:35.460]   And then two or three in the morning, they're wide awake.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.540]   What are you going to do at two or three
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.520]   when you're wide awake, sit in the dark?
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.900]   No, you're going to get online.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:41.960]   You're going to listen to things.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.140]   You might have, I'm not recommending this,
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:46.920]   but an alcoholic drink in order to try and fall asleep.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.280]   I mean, this is the pattern.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.800]   And so, you know, shaking up that pattern is really what,
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:56.380]   what so much of my public health work these days is about
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.860]   and trying to get people onto a more natural daylight,
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:01.600]   night, night, dark rhythm.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.040]   But yeah, it's impossible to tease apart.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.680]   We do know this, and this is really serious.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.200]   We know that in almost every instance,
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.200]   almost every psychopathology report of suicide in the weeks,
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:17.780]   but especially in the days preceding suicide,
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:21.220]   that person's circadian rhythms looked almost inverted
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:22.980]   from their normal patterns.
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:28.340]   And that's true of non-bipolar individuals as well.
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.500]   You know, circadian disruption and disruption
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.580]   in psychiatric health are inextricable.
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:37.540]   Conversely, positive mood and affect
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:41.160]   and circadian behavior seem very correlated.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:44.400]   I mean, I think it's clear that
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.660]   if you want to become an early riser,
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:47.360]   get light in your eyes and get activity
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.040]   in your body early in the day.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.240]   You built, you entrained to those rhythms
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.280]   so that you start to anticipate that morning workout.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:55.500]   You start to anticipate the morning sunlight.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.200]   Just one more scientific point.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.640]   We know that when you view bright sunlight in the morning
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.720]   or just sunlight that's illuminating your environment,
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:06.200]   as you said, you don't even have to see the sun itself,
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.440]   that there's a 50, five zero percent increase
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.780]   in the amplitude of the morning cortisol spike,
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:12.960]   which is a good thing.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:13.920]   - Right, that's where you want it.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.600]   - Because it's inversely,
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.440]   the amplitude of the morning cortisol spike
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.120]   is inversely related to the amplitude
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.480]   of the evening cortisol spike
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.520]   and high evening cortisol is associated
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.080]   with middle of the night waking and on and on.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.540]   So, you know, I'm very bullish on these mechanisms.
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.280]   I also love that they're so deeply woven
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.000]   into our evolutionary history, you know,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.820]   that we share with single cell organisms.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:39.860]   It's so wild, but of course,
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.700]   there's going to be a bi-directionality there
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:44.380]   and it's impossible to see where one thing starts
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:46.060]   and the other one stops.
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.640]   - I mean, here's my take, Andrew.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.000]   First of all, I actually, with far less authority than you,
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.680]   agree with your assessment
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.400]   and might even be a little bit more bullish,
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.460]   might even put it at 80/20.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.500]   And here I'll give you my explanations,
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:05.500]   which stem more from my fastidious battles
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:07.600]   with epidemiology in general, right?
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.640]   Like, because so much of the world that I live in
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.520]   still has to rely on epidemiologic data.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.320]   And so how do you make sense of it?
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.240]   And the truth of it is most of it is really pretty bad.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.560]   But I tend to find myself looking
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.760]   at the Austin Bradford Hill criteria all the time.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.800]   And for folks who don't know,
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.980]   he was a statistician who basically proposed
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:32.960]   a set of criteria, believe there are eight of them.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:33.920]   And I can't believe I don't know
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.320]   every one of them off by heart.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.420]   I certainly used to.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:40.740]   But the more of these criteria that are met
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.820]   within your correlations,
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:46.760]   the more likelihood you will find causality.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.780]   So when I think of your data here, the data in this paper,
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:53.260]   I'll tell you what makes these correlations
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:55.740]   seem to have causality within them
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:57.700]   in the direction that's being proposed.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:01.240]   Look at the dose effect.
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.560]   So dose effect matters, and this is done in quartiles,
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.780]   and that's a very elegant thing.
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:09.000]   If they just did it as on/off, it would be harder.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:09.840]   High, low.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.320]   That's right, but the fact that they did it in quartiles
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.380]   allows you to see that every example in figure two,
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:17.280]   I don't believe there is an exception to this.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.360]   No, and I think also in the other figure.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.620]   There's only one exception to what I'm about to say.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:24.240]   Sorry, two out of like, God knows how many,
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.200]   they're all monotonically increasing and decreasing.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.280]   In other words, the dose effect is always present.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.080]   Another thing is biologic plausibility.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.700]   You've spoken at length about that today.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.720]   So in other words, sometimes you have to look
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.860]   at epidemiology and ask, is there a biologic explanation?
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:41.800]   And here there is.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.640]   You've added another one, which is evolutionary conservation
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.540]   to the biologic plausibility.
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.360]   Then you can talk about animal models or experiments
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.700]   in humans over short durations
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:54.180]   that generally support these findings.
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:55.440]   And so those are just a couple
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:59.480]   of the Bradford Hill criteria that lead to
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.360]   my belief that, yeah, there's reverse causality here,
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:08.820]   but it's not the full explanation.
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.720]   And that more of the explanation is probably
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.680]   the direction that's being proposed.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:15.380]   And if that's true, 'cause then at the end of the day,
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.840]   like what's the purpose of the discussion?
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:20.360]   The purpose of the discussion is if you are
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.140]   under the influence of any of these psychiatric conditions,
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:26.280]   in addition to the treatments you're doing now,
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.620]   what else can you do?
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:31.740]   And to me, the takeaway is follow these light behaviors.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:35.740]   I mean, it's a relatively low lift when you consider
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:36.580]   some of the other things.
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:38.700]   Like I'm over here asking people to do zone two
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:41.380]   for three hours a week and VO2 max workouts
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:42.800]   and all this other stuff.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:45.020]   And like, I think all those things matter
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:46.940]   for mental health as much as physical health.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:51.940]   But this strikes me as on the spectrum of low asks,
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:56.740]   if it shows, if it's only even 30% causality,
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:59.360]   70% reverse causality, like I'll take those.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.180]   I would still instate that.
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:03.860]   Yeah, and it's taking your coffee on the balcony.
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:05.860]   And people will often say,
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:07.740]   well, how do you do this with kids?
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:10.340]   The kids should be doing it too, right?
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:12.020]   It means popping your sunglasses off.
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.680]   It means getting out for just a few minutes.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.260]   And the fact that it's additive,
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:20.260]   that these photon counting mechanisms, they sum, is great.
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:24.580]   And look, this paper also says,
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:25.740]   and I should have stated this earlier,
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.900]   if you missed your daytime light ration,
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.960]   get your nighttime dark ration.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.720]   They are independent and additive.
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:36.140]   So that's, I mean, that's really something.
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.740]   But of course, ideally you get both.
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:39.060]   But I appreciate your take on it.
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:44.060]   And thanks for your expertise in parsing epidemiology.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:48.100]   I look at fewer studies of that sort,
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:49.500]   but I learned from you.
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.740]   And that's one of the reasons
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.940]   I love doing these journal clubs is I learn.
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:54.940]   So along those lines,
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:58.160]   tell us about the paper you selected.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.300]   I'm really eager to learn more.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.560]   Well, I wanted to pick a paper
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.340]   that was kind of interesting as a paper.
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.580]   And this paper, I think, is interesting
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:12.540]   in that it is kind of the landmark study
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.620]   of a class of drugs.
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.400]   But in the same way that you kind of picked a paper
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.320]   that I think has a much broader overarching importance,
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.200]   the reason I picked this paper,
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.520]   which is from the New England Journal of Medicine,
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.100]   it's about 10 years old, no correction, 13 years old,
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:34.300]   is because it is kind of the landmark study
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.980]   in a class of drugs that I believe
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:39.460]   are the most relevant class of drugs
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:42.500]   we've seen so far in cancer therapy.
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:46.140]   And even though the net effect of these drugs
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.300]   has only served to reduce mortality
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:53.240]   by maybe eight to 10%, which is not a huge amount,
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.380]   it's the manner in which they've done it
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:59.060]   that gives me great hope for the future,
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:00.960]   even if it's through other means.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.300]   So I'll take a step back before we go into the paper
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.540]   for, again, just the context and background.
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:14.140]   So the human immune system is kind of a remarkable thing.
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:18.080]   It's hard when you're sort of trying to imagine
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.860]   what's the most amazing part of the human system.
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:22.440]   And maybe it's my bias as well,
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:25.680]   because just as you spent your time in the light system
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.900]   and the photosensing system,
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:29.920]   I spent my time in the immunology world,
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.380]   but it is remarkable to me how our immune systems evolved.
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:37.260]   And they have this really brutal task,
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:41.120]   which is how can they be tuned
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:46.120]   to detect any foreign pathogen that is harmful
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.260]   without knowing a priori what that could be,
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.600]   while at the same, so in other words,
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:56.680]   how can you tune a system to be so aggressive
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.760]   that it can eradicate any virus or bacteria
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.940]   billions of years into the future
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.000]   without knowing what it's going to be,
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.600]   but at the same time, it has to be so forgiving of the self
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.620]   that it doesn't turn around and attack the self.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.080]   It's remarkable.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.120]   And of course, we can always think of the exceptions.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.040]   There are things called autoimmune conditions.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.600]   So clearly the system fails,
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.840]   and the immune system turns around and attacks the self.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.440]   If you see a person with vitiligo,
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.680]   I have a little bit of vitiligo on my back,
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.760]   a couple of spots,
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:32.320]   clearly the immune system is attacking something there
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.960]   and destroying some of the pigment.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.920]   - I didn't realize vitiligo was autoimmune.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.320]   - Yeah, so there are lots of
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.120]   more serious autoimmune conditions.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.740]   Of course, somebody that has lupus
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.600]   or where the immune system can be attacking the kidney,
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:47.040]   the immune system can be attacking anywhere.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.460]   Autoimmune conditions can be deadly,
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:51.040]   but fortunately they are very rare.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.160]   And for the most part,
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.720]   this immune system works remarkably well.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:58.020]   So how does it work?
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.820]   And why is it that cancer seems to evade it
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.140]   virtually all of the time?
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.640]   This is the question.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.660]   Now let's first of all talk about how it works.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:11.060]   And then when I tell you how it works,
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:12.920]   you'll say, that sounds amazing.
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.520]   Clearly it should be able to destroy cancer.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.680]   I'm gonna simplify it by only talking about one system,
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.280]   which is how T cells recognize and get activated,
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.160]   how T cells recognize antigens.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:31.060]   So we have something called an antigen.
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:35.880]   So an antigen is an antibody generating peptide.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:39.320]   So it's a protein, almost always a protein,
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.600]   they can be carbohydrates,
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.900]   but they're almost always proteins.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:43.700]   And they're very, very small peptides.
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:47.060]   Like we're talking as little as nine amino acids,
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.780]   maybe up to 20 amino acids.
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:51.780]   So teeny tiny little peptides.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:55.340]   But it's amazing that in such a short peptide,
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:59.940]   the body can recognize if that's Andrew or not Andrew.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.660]   I mean, when again, think about like,
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:04.400]   we talk about proteins in kilodaltons, right?
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.460]   We're talking about proteins in terms of thousands
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:10.540]   of amino acids that make up every protein in your body.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:13.860]   And yet if it samples a protein and sees that,
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:17.860]   hey, this little nine, 10, 15 peptide amino acid
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:21.300]   is not part of you, I know it's bad.
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.360]   And therefore I'm going to generate
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.180]   an immune response to it.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:29.020]   So we have what are called antigen presenting cells.
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:33.700]   You have cells that go around sampling peptides,
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:38.300]   and they will on these things called MHC class receptors,
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:41.100]   bring the peptide up to the surface
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.700]   and serve it up to the T cell.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.860]   There are two types of these.
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:48.360]   There's MHC class one and MHC class two.
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:49.200]   I only bring--
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.460]   - So this is major histocompatibility complex.
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:52.300]   - That's correct.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:58.260]   And we refer to them that way because of the context
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:44:59.800]   in which they were discovered,
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.060]   which was for organ rejection.
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:05.620]   So not surprisingly, when you need to put a kidney
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:09.660]   into another person, if that kidney is deemed foreign,
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:10.860]   it will not last long.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.180]   In the early days of organ transplantation,
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.580]   we're rife with immediate rejections.
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:17.260]   And by not, I mean,
[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:19.920]   the immediates are the ABO incompatibilities,
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:23.220]   but you know, the sort of next layer of incompatibility
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:26.140]   was MHC incompatibility, which would lead to, you know,
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:30.080]   within weeks the organ is gone as opposed to within hours.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.220]   So you have these two classes of MHC.
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:35.420]   You have class one and class two.
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:38.860]   Class one is what we call endogenous.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:43.300]   So this is basically what happens when a protein
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.260]   or an antigen is coming from inside the cell.
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:48.240]   So let's consider the flu.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.020]   So if you get the flu,
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:53.340]   the influenza virus infects the respiratory epithelium
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:55.780]   of your, you know, your larynx.
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:00.300]   And that virus, as you know, folks listening might remember
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.400]   from our days of talking about COVID,
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.260]   viruses can't replicate on their own.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:08.740]   What they do is they hijack the replication machinery
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:12.740]   of the host and they use that either to insert their RNA
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.220]   or DNA to replicate.
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:16.260]   And in the process, proteins are being made.
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:18.540]   Well, those proteins are the proteins of the virus,
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:19.880]   not of us.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.020]   So some of those peptides get launched
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:27.180]   onto these MHC class one gloves.
[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.760]   Basically the glove comes up to the surface
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.420]   and a T cell comes along.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:35.660]   And in the case of MHC class one, it's a CD8 T cell.
[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:38.620]   These are what are called the killer T cells, right?
[01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:42.660]   And so this cell comes along and with its T cell receptor,
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:47.120]   the T cell receptor meets the MHC class one receptor
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.720]   with the antigen in it.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.540]   And if that's a lock, it realizes that's my target.
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.860]   And it begins to replicate and proliferate and target those.
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:58.580]   And that creates the immune response.
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.060]   And by the way, that's how it works
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.140]   when you vaccinate somebody.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:03.820]   You're basically pre-building that thing up.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:06.760]   - So would this fall under the adaptive immune response
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.500]   or the innate immune response?
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.580]   - No, this is adaptive, yep.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:13.180]   Innate is just these pure antibody response
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:14.020]   on the B cell side.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:17.420]   I won't get into that for the purpose of this discussion.
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:21.260]   The other example is MHC class two.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:24.700]   And that's also part of the adaptive system
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:27.580]   or the innate system, which is more what we call
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:29.780]   the exogenous form.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.440]   So these are peptides that are usually coming
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.900]   from outside the cell.
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:36.020]   So we're gonna focus more on the MHC class one
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:39.900]   because this is peptides that come from inside the cell.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:41.920]   Okay, so just keep in the back of your mind,
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.280]   if a foreign protein gets presented from inside a cell
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:48.140]   to outside a cell, the T cells recognize that
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:50.020]   and they will mount a foreign response.
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:53.740]   And by the way, that's why we basically can beat any virus.
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:57.120]   Like if you consider how many viruses are around us,
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.520]   the fact that we almost never die from a viral infection
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.700]   is a remarkable achievement
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:04.340]   of how well this immune system works.
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:06.100]   We're constantly combating these viruses.
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:07.480]   Constantly, and by the way,
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:10.900]   we don't really have very effective antiviral agents.
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:11.980]   It's not like antibiotics.
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.260]   Like we have antibiotics up the wazoo.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:17.600]   I mean, we're way better at fighting viruses than bacteria.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.860]   Can I just ask one question?
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:19.900]   I've always wondered about this.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:23.080]   To what extent is our ability to ward off viruses
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.380]   on a day-to-day basis as an adult,
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.900]   reliant on us having been exposed
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:30.980]   to that virus during development?
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:32.420]   Like as I walk around today,
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:35.740]   maybe I'll be exposed to 100,000 different viruses.
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.520]   Would you say that half of those,
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.900]   I've already got antibodies too,
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:40.480]   because I was exposed to them
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:42.060]   at some prior portion of my life?
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:43.600]   Yeah, harder to quantify.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.900]   And the other ones, I'm just building up antibodies.
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.760]   Like I was on a plane last night,
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.820]   someone was coughing, so I was hiding.
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.020]   And I had COVID a little while ago,
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:52.380]   so I wasn't too worried about that.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:53.620]   And I feel great today.
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:58.620]   But I just assume that on that plane,
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.360]   I'm in a swamp of viruses, no matter what,
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.940]   and that most of them I've already been exposed to
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.240]   since I was a little kid.
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.400]   So I've got all the antibodies
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.440]   and they're just fighting it back,
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.600]   binding up those viruses and destroying them.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:13.740]   Yeah, I think it's part that,
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:15.100]   and I also think it's part of them
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.560]   that our body can destroy
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.480]   without mounting much of an immune response.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.560]   So therefore your immune system is doing the work,
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.640]   and yet it's not mounting a systemic inflammatory response
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:24.560]   that you're not sensing.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.620]   So is it also a physical trapping in my nasal epithelium,
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:29.460]   it's a virus issue?
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.940]   Yeah, so yeah, you have huge barriers, right?
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:34.600]   So the skin, the hairs in your nose,
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.240]   all of these things are huge barriers.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:39.920]   But assuming that still a bunch of them are getting in,
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.100]   at least the respiratory ones,
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.420]   that's the other thing to keep in mind, right?
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:44.460]   There are certain viruses that are totally useless
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:46.260]   floating around the air, right?
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:47.780]   There are certain viruses,
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:49.920]   the viruses that most people are really afraid of,
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.860]   Hep C, Hep B, HIV, well,
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:56.000]   if they're sitting on a table or floating around the air,
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.220]   they're of no threat to you.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:00.680]   They have to be sort of transmitted through the barrier.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:04.080]   But again, some of these viruses you're gonna defeat
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.300]   without an enormous response.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.600]   And then some of them,
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.760]   why is influenza quote unquote, such a bad virus?
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:13.240]   Whereas the common respiratory cold
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.040]   kind of sidelines you for a day.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.200]   It's the immune response that you're feeling.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.760]   The worse, the bigger the immune response to the virus,
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:21.880]   the more you're feeling that.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:25.920]   You feel your immune system going crazy, right?
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.120]   The interleukins that are spiking,
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:29.780]   the third spacing that occurs
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:32.000]   to get more and more of the immune cells there,
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.600]   the spike of your temperature
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:35.940]   as your body basically tries to cook the virus,
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.300]   all of that stuff is your body doing-
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.240]   - The fatigue.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.540]   - Yeah, yeah, you're being drained and all this happening.
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:43.840]   So one more point I'll mention,
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.440]   just to close the loop on the autoimmunity,
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.280]   how is it that we learn not to attack ourselves?
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.120]   That's something called thymic selection
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.420]   that occurs in infancy.
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:57.980]   So you and I have a no good for nothing,
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:50:59.580]   tiny little thymus that would be,
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:01.740]   it's almost impossible to see these things.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:03.980]   You know, when we used to operate on people,
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:07.860]   you know, the thymus is barely visible in an adult,
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:10.520]   in a healthy adult outside of thymic tumors.
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.760]   But in a child, the thymus is quite large.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:16.680]   And the purpose of the thymus is to educate T cells
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:20.580]   and basically show the T cells what self is.
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:24.700]   And any T cell that doesn't immediately recognize it
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.840]   gets killed.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.760]   So it's a really clever system
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:31.500]   where we basically teach you to recognize self
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:32.780]   at a very early age.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:35.060]   And if you can't do that, you're weeded out.
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:37.600]   And then the thymus involutes thereafter
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.580]   because it's sort of served its purpose.
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:42.720]   Okay, now let's talk about cancer.
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.300]   So what do we know about cancer?
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:46.100]   So we know that, again, you know,
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:48.740]   cancer is a genetic disease in the sense
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:52.480]   that every cancer has genetic mutations.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:55.540]   Most of those mutations are somatic,
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:59.380]   which means most of those mutations are mutations
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:01.140]   that occur during the course of our life.
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.820]   They're not germline mutations.
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:07.060]   The germline being the eggs and sperm, right?
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.300]   So it's all other cells.
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:11.060]   And I love that you pointed out that, you know,
[01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:14.180]   there can be, that cancer can be genetic
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:16.580]   but isn't necessarily inherited, right?
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:17.400]   In fact, it's rarely inherited.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.380]   They're genetic and they think inherited, right?
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.220]   Yes.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:22.420]   Inherited is always genetic to some extent,
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:25.300]   but genetic isn't always inherited.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:27.780]   Yeah, so there are a handful of cancers
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.220]   that are derived from inherited mutations.
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:35.620]   So Lynch syndrome is an example of that.
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:39.500]   Hereditary polyposis is an example of that,
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.540]   where you have a gene that gets passed through the germline
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:47.400]   and that gene codes for a protein like all genes do.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:49.300]   And it's either you have too much of a gene
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:50.400]   or too little of a gene.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.860]   So it's either a gene that promotes cancer
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:54.080]   and you have too much of that,
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.660]   or it's a gene that prevents cancer
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:57.380]   and you have too little of it
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:52:59.220]   or a dysfunctional version of it, right?
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:00.680]   So BRCA is an example of that.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.360]   BRCA is hereditary.
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:07.360]   BRCA codes for a protein and the women and men,
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.200]   but mostly the women that we think about
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:12.760]   who have a BRCA mutation that all, in some cases,
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:14.520]   almost guarantees breast cancer,
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:17.620]   it's because of a defective copy.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:19.420]   So it's like they don't get the protein
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:21.740]   that they need to protect them from breast cancer.
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:23.580]   So what do we know?
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:25.620]   Well, we know that,
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:28.980]   and this is probably one of the most remarkable things
[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:31.020]   I've ever learned,
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.100]   and it still blows my mind every time.
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.600]   Well, actually, before I get to that point,
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.820]   I want to make another point.
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:38.980]   Okay, so you might think,
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:43.360]   so cancer, you know, our cells become cancerous,
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.060]   but they're clearly hijacked
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:46.640]   because they have these mutations,
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.920]   and as a result of these mutations,
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:53.280]   they make proteins that allow cancers to behave differently.
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.880]   And cancers behave differently from non-cancers
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:58.600]   in two very critical ways.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:00.740]   The first way is that they do not respond
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.340]   to cell cycle signaling.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:07.340]   So if you cut your skin, it heals,
[01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:10.140]   but how does it know to heal just right
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:12.300]   and not to keep growing and growing and growing
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:13.340]   and growing and growing?
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:16.120]   Well, it knows that because there are cell cycle signals
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:18.120]   that tell it time to grow, time to stop.
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:21.800]   If, believe it or not, this is an extreme example,
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.640]   if you donated to me half of your liver,
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:25.860]   which I know you would.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:26.700]   - Absolutely.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:28.580]   I'd give you more than half of my liver.
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:29.420]   - Well, you'd only need to give me half.
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:30.580]   - If it meant that we could keep doing
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:32.520]   these journal clubs, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:36.340]   Within months, you would regenerate a full liver.
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:37.180]   - Yeah, that's so--
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:38.020]   - That's amazing.
[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:38.840]   - That's so wild.
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.680]   It's like a salamander.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.520]   You cut off a salamander limb,
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:41.340]   and please don't do that experiment
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:43.580]   'cause other people are doing it anyway,
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:44.660]   and it grows back.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:47.340]   - Yeah, and it knows how much to grow back.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.180]   - So wild.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.580]   - So when the cell is perfectly functioning,
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:52.700]   it knows how much to grow, and it's,
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:54.140]   well, cancer loses that ability.
[01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:56.500]   That is one of the hallmarks of cancer.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.820]   It just keeps growing.
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:59.060]   It doesn't grow faster, by the way.
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:54:59.900]   That's a misnomer.
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:02.320]   People think cancers grow faster than non-cancers.
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:04.020]   There's no real evidence that that's the case.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:05.700]   They just don't stop growing.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:09.420]   The second property of cancer is the capacity
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:12.620]   to leave the site of origin,
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.700]   go someplace else, and take up residence.
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:15.540]   - So that's metastases.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:17.580]   - That's the metastases component.
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:19.840]   So if you think about it for a minute,
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:22.820]   a cell that never stops replicating
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.660]   and has the capacity to up and leave and move
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:27.700]   and take up residence is clearly different
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:29.080]   from the cell itself, right?
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.940]   So if I have a cell of colonic epithelium,
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:34.220]   the cell that lines the inside of my colon,
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:36.300]   it's clearly got a set of proteins in it.
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:39.860]   But if all of a sudden that thing can grow, grow, grow,
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:43.100]   grow, grow, not stop, not stop, not listen to the signal,
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:45.240]   and then somehow wind its way into the liver
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.020]   and just keep growing and growing and growing,
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.080]   it must have different proteins.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.140]   So the question then becomes, why does cancer even exist?
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:56.780]   How has our immune system not figured out a way
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:00.220]   to just silence this and eradicate it the way it does
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:02.580]   to virtually every virus you encounter?
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:05.740]   And to me, this is one of the most interesting questions
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:07.660]   in all of biology, and it really comes down
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:11.220]   to how clever cancer is, unfortunately,
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:14.420]   how evolutionarily clever it is.
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:17.820]   It basically does a lot of things
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.700]   to trick the immune system.
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:22.560]   So it has its own secretory factors
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:25.060]   that tamp down the immune system.
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:28.940]   It grows in an environment because of its nature.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:31.820]   So one of the things that's long understood about cancer
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:34.060]   is it's heavily glycolytic.
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:36.140]   And when something is heavily glycolytic,
[01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:39.900]   it's going glucose to pyruvate to lactate nonstop.
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:41.660]   There are lots of reasons for that.
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:45.180]   I think there's more than one.
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.420]   - What does that afford it?
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:49.700]   Does that, is that afforded a migratory potential?
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:50.780]   - No, so it's super interesting.
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:52.420]   So that's the effect that what I just described
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:54.100]   is called the Warburg effect.
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:57.260]   And when Warburg proposed this,
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:00.740]   which God was probably in the 1920s,
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:03.120]   it was before World War II,
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.820]   he proposed it because he thought the mitochondria
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:09.140]   of cancer cells were defective.
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:12.260]   So he proposed that the cancer cells' mitochondria
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:15.540]   don't work, hence they have to undergo glycolysis.
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:19.840]   They can't undergo aerobic metabolism.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:23.700]   We now know that that's not the case.
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:26.280]   So we now know that the Warburg effect
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.620]   or the Warburg effect, if I'll refer to him correctly
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:31.900]   by his name, almost assuredly does not have to do
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:33.420]   with defective mitochondria.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:35.900]   Others have proposed several mechanisms.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.620]   I think there's probably more than one thing going on.
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:41.260]   So a paper that came out in 2009, very influential paper
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:46.220]   by a guy named Matt Vander Heiden and Craig Thompson
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:50.360]   and Lou Cantley proposed that the reason
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:52.560]   that cancer cells do the Warburg effect
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.620]   is that they're not optimizing for energy,
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.660]   they're optimizing for cellular building blocks.
[01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:58.120]   And if you do the mass balance,
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.500]   it completely makes sense.
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:03.960]   Like dividing cells need building blocks more than energy.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.840]   And glycolysis, while very inefficient for generating ATP,
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:09.760]   is much more efficient at generating substrate
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.200]   to make more cells.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.020]   But another proposed mechanism is exactly at this one.
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:17.860]   Glycolysis lowers the surrounding pH because of lactate.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:19.960]   Lactate attracts hydrogen, pH goes down.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:22.260]   And guess what that does to the immune system?
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:23.840]   It attracts the immune system.
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.680]   So it's also a way to hide from the immune system.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:29.700]   - So there's like a pH cloaking.
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:32.520]   Leveraging pH to cloak the signal
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.320]   that the immune system would otherwise see.
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.160]   - Yep.
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:36.980]   And then when you layer on top of that,
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:40.280]   that it knows how to secrete things like IL-10, TGF beta,
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:42.040]   all of these other secretory factors
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.000]   that also inhibit the immune system,
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.420]   basically it's figured out a way
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:48.300]   to kind of hide itself from the immune system.
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:51.400]   - The way you describe it, cancer sounds like a virus.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:52.240]   - Yes.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:53.060]   - I mean, it sounds a lot like a virus.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:55.460]   And that leads me to ask,
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:57.940]   are there any examples of contagious cancers?
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:00.800]   I recall seeing some studies about these little critters
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:04.180]   down in Australia, Tasmanian devils,
[01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:05.780]   that like they would,
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:09.260]   they scratch each other and fight as Tasmanian devils do.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:11.240]   They're actually quite cute.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.360]   And they would get cancers and tumors growing on their faces.
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:16.180]   - Yes, so it-
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:20.160]   - And so it was like a literal physical interaction
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.840]   that could transmit cancer from one animal to the next.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:25.020]   - So it's less that there are viruses
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:26.740]   that cause cancer.
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:28.980]   So in that sense, you could argue, yes,
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:30.740]   there are contagious cancers.
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:31.840]   - Well, HPV.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:36.060]   - Sure, yeah, HPV, Hep B, Hep C,
[01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:38.500]   but there are even cancers like cutaneous cancers
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:40.220]   that arise from viruses.
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:43.580]   But I don't know if that's quite the same
[01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:44.620]   as what you're saying, like-
[01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:46.060]   - No, no, they're both,
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:47.620]   what you're saying is an important point.
[01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:50.700]   I mean, we don't wanna go down the rabbit hole of HPV,
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:53.220]   but right, that's increasing susceptibility
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.300]   to cervical cancer.
[01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.180]   Now there's a vaccine against HPV, right?
[01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:00.020]   There wasn't when we were in college, as we all knew.
[02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:03.620]   There was no vaccine, but the, okay, so, but yeah,
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:06.820]   direct transmission of cancers from one organism
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:08.380]   to the next, more rare.
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:11.860]   - Yes, okay, so now, a moment ago I said
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:14.620]   there's this really incredible thing about cancer
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.320]   that blows my mind and about our immune system,
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:21.320]   which is that at least 80% of solid organ tumors,
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:23.820]   and we're gonna mostly talk about solid organ tumors,
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.500]   'cause that's where the field of oncology
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:28.300]   has made very little progress.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.020]   So if you go back 50 years,
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:31.940]   where has oncology made huge progress?
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:36.020]   It's made great progress in blood tumors,
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:38.860]   leukemias, and some kinds of lymphomas.
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:40.380]   In fact, there's two kinds of lymphomas
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:41.920]   where the progress has been remarkable.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:44.980]   One has been in Hodgkin's lymphoma,
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:47.900]   and the other has also been in immunotherapy,
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.660]   has been in a type of B-cell lymphoma,
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.900]   where that B-cell demonstrates
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:55.660]   or presents something called a CD19 receptor.
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:59.300]   So in B-cell lymphomas with CD19,
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:01.960]   there's a very unique niche immunotherapy,
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:03.480]   we won't talk about that today,
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.920]   called CAR-T therapy that has got rid of those guys,
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:08.540]   and then leukemias have also been pretty good.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:11.380]   But in solid organ tumors,
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:14.140]   there've been only two real breakthroughs
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:15.220]   in the last 50 years.
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:18.920]   One has been the therapy for a certain type
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:22.300]   of testicular cancer, and it's really just
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:24.160]   a chemotherapy cocktail that has been found
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:26.120]   to work really well, and the other has been
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:28.380]   in this really rare kind of gastric cancer
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:31.420]   called the GI stromal tumor, which happens to result
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:33.860]   from one mutation in a kinase pathway,
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:36.620]   and there's one drug that can now target that,
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:38.180]   and it works, it's kind of amazing.
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:39.180]   Cures that cancer.
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:40.020]   Cures that.
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.540]   What I'm talking about are the cancers
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:45.120]   that kill virtually everybody else.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.180]   This is what, when you sort of line up,
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.720]   what are the big causes of cancer death?
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:50.680]   Let's start at the top.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:55.320]   It's lung, it's then breast and prostate in men and women,
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.080]   it's colorectal, it's pancreas.
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:58.200]   Those are the big five.
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:00.980]   They kill more than 50% of Americans.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:04.100]   Cancer-wise, not, sorry, let me restate that.
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:06.400]   More than 50% of cancer deaths in Americans
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:08.260]   come from those five.
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:10.700]   These are what we call the solid epithelial tumors,
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:12.080]   and you can march down the list,
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.960]   and most cancers that most people are thinking of
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:14.800]   are those cancers.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:17.400]   Good thing, more than 80% of those cancers
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:20.920]   have antigens that are recognized
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:23.240]   by the host's immune system.
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.300]   I will state it again because it is so profound.
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:31.300]   80% at least of those cancers actually generate an antigen,
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:35.280]   meaning a little peptide in that cell
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:40.280]   gets presented to the T cell, and it is recognizable.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:45.000]   And now the question is, why is that not sufficient
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.520]   to induce remission?
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:52.520]   And the short answer is there are not enough T cells
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.160]   that are able to act,
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:58.620]   and/or they are being sufficiently inhibited from acting,
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:01.020]   which gets me to the point of this paper.
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:05.000]   One of the ways in which the body inhibits
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.920]   the immune system, which we should remind ourselves
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:10.340]   is an important thing, right,
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:13.320]   is something called a checkpoint inhibitor.
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.060]   Okay, so go back to that idea that I talked about before.
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:19.320]   You have an antigen-presenting cell.
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:24.320]   It brings up an MHC receptor with a peptide on it,
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:26.860]   and there is a T cell that is coming,
[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:28.200]   and I actually brought a diagram,
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.680]   which I'm going to link to this
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:31.960]   'cause I don't want to make this too complicated,
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:34.480]   but I really think that this figure
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:38.000]   is helpful to understand how these drugs work.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.380]   So the MHC receptor with the peptide is sitting there,
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:45.580]   and it binds to the T cell receptor on the T cell,
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:48.560]   but there is another receptor on the T cell,
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:51.960]   a CTLA-4 receptor,
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:56.240]   and that binds to a receptor that I won't bother naming now
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.100]   'cause the names don't matter,
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:01.300]   but there's another receptor on the antigen-presenting cell
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:03.040]   that binds to that,
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:07.440]   and that acts as the breaks in the reaction.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:11.320]   So CTLA-4, which is on the T cell,
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.320]   binds to another CD receptor on the antigen-presenting cell,
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:18.680]   and it says, "Tamp down the response."
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:21.600]   And the reason for that is
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.440]   we want to keep our immune system in check.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.680]   This basically is a way of asking the immune system,
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:29.900]   'cause remember, when the immune system sees that antigen,
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:31.340]   it wants to go nuts.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.480]   It wants to start replicating and killing.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.800]   This is a CD8 T cell.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.580]   It is a targeted killer T cell.
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:41.160]   The checkpoint says, "Let's double-check that.
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:43.940]   "Let's be sure, let's tamp down the response."
[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:47.960]   And as a result of that, a thought experiment emerged,
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:51.800]   which was, "What if we block CTLA-4?
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:54.320]   "What if we block the checkpoint?
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.780]   "Could we unleash the immune system a little bit more?"
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:01.580]   And I will say this.
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:04.240]   At the time it was proposed,
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:06.960]   it seemed a bit far-fetched.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:10.100]   Because of the complexity of the immune system,
[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:11.920]   it seemed a little far-fetched
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:15.560]   that simply blocking the checkpoint would have any effect.
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:20.980]   It's also worth noting that prior to this,
[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:24.620]   one immunotherapy had found some efficacy,
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:27.200]   which was trying the exact opposite strategy.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:30.080]   Rather than blocking the inhibitor,
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:33.320]   it was throwing more accelerant at the fire,
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.600]   which was giving something called interleukin-2.
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:39.280]   So interleukin-2 is, for lack of a better word,
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:42.440]   candy and fuel for T cells.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:45.040]   So the idea was, if we have T cells
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:48.520]   that innately recognize a cancer antigen,
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:52.000]   can we just give high doses of interleukin-2
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.160]   and have them undergo proliferation and response?
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:57.960]   And the answer turned out to be yes,
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:01.640]   but only in two cancers, melanoma and kidney cancer,
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:03.360]   and only at very small levels.
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:06.880]   About 10% of the population would respond to these things.
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:08.280]   Now, look, that's 10% of people
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:10.040]   who were gonna be dead within six months,
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:12.320]   'cause these are devastating cancers,
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.880]   and once they spread, there are no treatments
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.800]   that have any efficacy whatsoever.
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.240]   In fact, I think median survival for metastatic melanoma
[02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:21.080]   at the time was probably four months.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:23.400]   So this was a very grim death sentence.
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:27.360]   But the idea now was,
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.260]   what about doing the exact opposite approach?
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:34.100]   Instead of trying to throw more fire at the T cell,
[02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:35.740]   what if we can take its breaks down?
[02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:38.540]   Less gas, pardon me, instead of giving more gas,
[02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:39.840]   let's give less breaks.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.580]   And there were some phase two,
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:45.460]   some phase one studies that demonstrated efficacy.
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:47.820]   Phase two, and the paper I'm gonna talk about today
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:51.100]   is the phase three study
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:55.820]   that compared the first version of these.
[02:06:55.820 --> 02:06:58.660]   So the drug we're gonna talk about today
[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:03.120]   is an anti-CTLA-4 drug called ipilimumab.
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:07.000]   There is another drug out there
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.200]   that came along shortly thereafter
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:12.780]   that is an anti-PD-1 drug.
[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:17.780]   So PD-1 turns out to be another one of these checkpoints
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:20.200]   on T cells.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:22.180]   And the Nobel Prize, by the way,
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:25.680]   I think it was 2018 or 2019 in medicine or physiology,
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:28.700]   was actually awarded to the two scientists
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:31.900]   who discovered CTLA-4 and PD-1.
[02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:35.820]   So I believe this is the only Nobel Prize in medicine
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:37.180]   for immunotherapy.
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:38.220]   It's a very big deal.
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:44.160]   So this study sought to compare the effect of anti-CTLA-4
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:50.480]   to a placebo.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:53.020]   And the placebo in this case was not a real placebo.
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:57.360]   It was a peptide vaccine called GP-100
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:02.380]   to ask the question, in patients with metastatic melanoma,
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:06.180]   what would be the impact on median survival
[02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:08.400]   and overall survival?
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:12.380]   So let's talk a little bit about the paper.
[02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:15.980]   So again, one of the funny things about this is,
[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:17.740]   I used to read these papers a lot, Andrew.
[02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:20.580]   These used to be my bread and butter papers.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:25.580]   So I mean, reading these, it's my hobby.
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:29.700]   And I don't read them that much anymore.
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:32.720]   So it was kind of amazing how long it took me
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.720]   to remind myself of stuff I used to remember.
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:38.080]   But you do have to kind of go back and read the methods
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.220]   and figure out who were the patients in this?
[02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:42.380]   What was the eligibility criteria?
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:43.860]   Why did they do it this way?
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:46.140]   And of course it all kind of came back to me,
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:48.220]   but it took a minute.
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:51.820]   So the first thing is, these are all patients
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:56.260]   who had progressed through every standard therapy.
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:59.380]   So these are patients for whom there were no other options.
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:05.300]   These patients either had very advanced stage three melanoma,
[02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:08.520]   which means it was local regional melanoma,
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:10.140]   but it couldn't be resected.
[02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:15.020]   So an example of that would be a cancer
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:19.060]   that was completely engulfing,
[02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:20.980]   let's say the primary site was the cheek,
[02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:23.140]   and it had completely grown
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:25.900]   into all of the surrounding soft tissue.
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:27.400]   It hadn't spread anywhere,
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:30.380]   but it was all the lymph nodes of the neck.
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:32.340]   And I've seen patients like this
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:34.580]   and it's just completely disfiguring.
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:37.980]   And they'd already been through the standard chemotherapy
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:40.200]   and nothing was working and the thing was growing.
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.820]   And then it was mostly made up of patients
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:44.060]   with stage four cancer.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.120]   Now melanoma has a very funny staging system.
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.700]   So in cancer, we typically talk about something
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:52.300]   called the TNM staging system.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.740]   It is the standard way that cancers are staged.
[02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:56.780]   T refers to the tumor size,
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:59.340]   N refers to the lymph node status,
[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:03.260]   and M refers to the presence or absence of metastases.
[02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:07.300]   And for most cancers, it is a very simple system.
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:11.300]   It is, you know, T is typically a number one, two,
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:12.960]   sometimes up to three and four,
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:15.140]   N is typically zero, one or two,
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:16.660]   and M is zero or one.
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:18.580]   Either there's no METs or there are METs.
[02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:21.200]   So for example, in colorectal cancer,
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:24.120]   the T staging determines the depth
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:26.460]   in the colon wall that it went.
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.220]   N is did it go to METs?
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.400]   And I think in colon, I'm a little rusty on this,
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:32.600]   I think colon has N zero, one or two,
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:34.300]   depending on how many lymph nodes.
[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:37.540]   And then M zero, did it go to anything beyond that,
[02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:40.220]   like to the liver, lung, et cetera, or not.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.720]   Melanoma is a bit more complicated.
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:44.820]   It has M zero, meaning no METs,
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:49.820]   but it also has M1A, M1B, M1C, and M1D.
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:52.260]   And within each of those,
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:56.560]   it has a threshold for high and low lactate dehydrogenase,
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:57.860]   or LDH.
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:01.460]   So it's both a staging based on imaging and biochemical.
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.380]   And the reason for that is LDH level
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:06.620]   is such a strong prognostic indicator of survival,
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:08.660]   in addition to M staging.
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:12.200]   Higher LDH levels tend to reflect more acidity,
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.160]   which we talked about why that's problematic,
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.200]   tends to reflect faster growing tumors,
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:19.000]   higher turnover, higher metabolic activity.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.960]   M1A, let me see if I can remember this,
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:27.960]   M1As are cancers that have metastasized
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:32.740]   to surrounding soft tissue,
[02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:34.080]   or soft tissue anywhere in the body,
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:35.680]   so anywhere else on the skin.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:37.360]   And you might think, well, that's kind of crazy,
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:38.520]   like, how does that happen?
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:39.480]   And it's really bizarre.
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:41.600]   You can have a patient who had a melanoma
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.240]   that showed up in one part of their body,
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:46.920]   and then they have metastases on other parts of their skin.
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:51.920]   M1B is, and I always get B and C confused,
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:54.520]   I think B is the lung.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:59.440]   So M1B is to the lung, M1C is to any internal organs,
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:03.080]   so liver, et cetera, and M1D is to the CNS.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.520]   And as those numbers increase,
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:05.340]   as those letters increase,
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:07.800]   the prognosis gets lower and lower and lower.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:09.320]   So one of the first things I always look at
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:10.800]   when I look at a paper like this is,
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:12.880]   tell me about the patient population.
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:17.380]   Like, what was the breakdown of patients?
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:19.960]   And in table one, so that's, again,
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:21.680]   in clinical papers like this,
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:26.200]   table one is always, always, always baseline characteristics.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:28.320]   Oh, I should mention one other thing, Andrew.
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:32.940]   This was done as a three to one to one randomization.
[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:35.860]   So again, in the simplest form,
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:38.300]   a study would have two groups, right?
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:39.320]   You would have,
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:43.560]   we're gonna just have a treatment group and a placebo group.
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:47.060]   But in this arm, you had three groups,
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:49.080]   with one of them being the placebo.
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:53.980]   The placebo got just GP100, which is just a cancer vaccine.
[02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:56.020]   By the way, this is a cancer vaccine
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:58.500]   that never showed any efficacy.
[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.940]   So it was a cancer vaccine that had been tested
[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:03.860]   both with interleukin-2 directly,
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.760]   and as an adjuvant for patients
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.840]   who had metastatic melanoma,
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:10.320]   or had, sorry, not metastatic melanoma,
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:13.200]   who had melanoma resected, who were tumor-free,
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:16.680]   and then given the vaccine as adjuvants to see,
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:19.160]   did that have an effect on outcomes, and it didn't.
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:21.400]   So it's kind of a known placebo.
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:25.960]   So you had that group, then you had the anti-CTLA-4 group,
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:30.080]   and then you had anti-CTLA-4 plus GP100.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.440]   Yeah, what's the rationale?
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.280]   For the three to one to one.
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:37.400]   It's basically, it increases statistical power, right?
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:42.360]   So this total study was a little under 700 people.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.140]   They put 400 in the anti-CTLA-4 plus GP100 group,
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:51.780]   and then a little over 130 in each of the other two groups.
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:53.000]   So you're always gonna be able
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.740]   to make these two comparisons, right?
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:57.580]   What you can check by doing this is,
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:00.820]   is there any effect of GP100 in this setting,
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:02.060]   which had never been done before.
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:07.060]   So again, GP100 is a known protein expressed by melanoma,
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:11.220]   and all of these people were haplotyped
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:14.560]   to make sure that their immune system would recognize it.
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:19.560]   And the question was, would giving people anti-CTLA-4,
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:22.080]   i.e. taking the breaks off their immune system,
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:24.840]   with or without GP100 make a difference?
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.240]   So kind of going through this,
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:30.860]   you can see it sort of skews about 60% to 40% male to female.
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:33.560]   They talk about something called the ECOG performance status.
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:36.320]   That refers to how healthy a patient is coming in.
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.960]   So ECOG0 is no limitations whatsoever,
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:40.920]   which is kind of amazing
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:42.180]   when you really consider something.
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:45.120]   I think this speaks to just how devastating this disease is.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.240]   These are patients who all have like six months to live,
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:52.800]   right, you know, a year max, and yet look at this,
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:56.480]   58 to 60% of them have no limitation
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.480]   on their quality of life at this very moment.
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:02.320]   That's going to change dramatically, you know,
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:03.460]   absent a cure here.
[02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:05.940]   And then ECOG1 has some limitation,
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:08.500]   and you can see that ECOG1 plus ECOG0
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:11.600]   is basically 98% of the population.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.380]   You can see the staging there.
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:15.960]   So again, very, very few of these patients
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.740]   are in the M0 category.
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:20.560]   M0s are people who have stage three disease
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.740]   that is so aggressive it can't be resected.
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:24.260]   That's about 1%,
[02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:26.900]   but the majority of these people are the M1As,
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:29.100]   M1Bs, M1Cs.
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:32.800]   So these are people with very aggressive cancers.
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:36.140]   You can also see that about 10 to 15% of these people
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:38.760]   also have CNS metastases.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:41.300]   Again, the poorest prognosis of the poor.
[02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:43.560]   And then you can see the,
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.560]   about 40% of them have the LDH level above cutoff.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:50.460]   All of this is to say,
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:55.220]   we're talking about a group of patients who have,
[02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:59.260]   you know, a very high likelihood of not surviving
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:02.100]   more than, you know, a year.
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:03.260]   It would be very, you know,
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:04.820]   unlikely that many of these patients
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:05.920]   would survive more than a year.
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:08.720]   So basically more than 70% of these people
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:10.620]   have visceral metastases.
[02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:13.700]   A third have high LDH and 10,
[02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:15.420]   more than 10% have brain mets.
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:19.920]   They've also all progressed through standard therapy.
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:21.480]   So-
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:23.020]   - Radiation, chemo.
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:27.080]   - Yeah, and the chemo for melanoma can be, you know,
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:30.940]   kind of a toxic chemo that really just
[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:33.140]   doesn't really do anything.
[02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:36.780]   - So is it commonplace to use a treatment
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:40.900]   that failed in clinical trials as a placebo
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.220]   in these sorts of studies?
[02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:43.340]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:45.860]   I think you're referring obviously to the GP100.
[02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:49.940]   And I think the thinking was,
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:54.000]   okay, it hasn't been effective in other treatments,
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.500]   for example, when combined with IL-2 or as an adjuvant,
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:00.340]   but never before has it been tried
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:01.900]   with a checkpoint inhibitor,
[02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:04.940]   which is the technical term for this type of drug.
[02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:09.580]   I think there was also some belief
[02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:12.120]   that it would be easier to enroll patients.
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:14.460]   I don't think they stated this, but that's often the case.
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:16.020]   It would be easier to enroll patients
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:18.700]   if they would know that even in the placebo arm,
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:20.860]   they're still getting an active agent.
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:21.700]   - Got it.
[02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:23.340]   And I suppose there's always the possibility
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:26.720]   that the combination of the failed drug
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:28.320]   with a new drug would work.
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:30.240]   And then, so you're increasing the probability
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:31.640]   for novel discovery.
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:32.480]   - For sure.
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:34.380]   And again, if you go back to the randomization
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:37.180]   of three to one to one,
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:42.160]   it's really only one fifth or 20% of the participants
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.440]   that would get just the GP100.
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:46.500]   So in other words, you're basically telling people
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:48.020]   when they come into this study,
[02:17:48.020 --> 02:17:52.660]   there's an 80% chance you're going to get anti-CTLA-4.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.260]   That's a much better set of odds than your typical study
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:57.940]   where you're going to be 50% likely
[02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:00.500]   to get the agent of interest.
[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:04.820]   - Right, and people who are literally dying of cancer,
[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:07.240]   they don't want to be in the control group.
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:09.320]   - Right, that's right.
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:11.980]   So the primary outcome for this study
[02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:14.380]   actually changed in the study.
[02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:17.340]   Now, they have to get permission to do that.
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:21.940]   So the original primary endpoint
[02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:24.820]   was the best overall response rate.
[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:27.040]   So I have to explain how response rates are measured.
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:29.640]   This is a bit complicated.
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:31.560]   Remember, all of these patients by definition
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:34.280]   have measurable visible cancer.
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:35.940]   By visible, either on the surface of their body,
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:39.240]   but more likely on an MRI or CT scan.
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:41.740]   So all of these patients had to be scanned head to toe
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:44.160]   within 12 weeks of enrollment.
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:45.680]   Again, there's another thing I should point out here,
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:46.700]   which I know you understand,
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:48.900]   but it's always worth reminding people.
[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:50.860]   When a study like this takes place,
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:53.220]   it usually takes place over many years.
[02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:56.700]   And so it's not the case that all 700 of these patients
[02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:59.280]   were enrolled on the same day and finished, you know,
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:00.860]   we finished observing them on the same day.
[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:03.860]   No, no, no, this took place for a very long period of time.
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:07.540]   This took place across tens of centers.
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.060]   I can't remember if this was just globally
[02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:12.540]   or across the world, it might've been across the world.
[02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:14.700]   And so every center really needs to adhere
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:16.260]   to a very strict protocol.
[02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:20.220]   And you have a central organization that is running this.
[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:21.500]   So you have a drug company.
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:24.300]   I think this is Bristol-Myers Squibb that makes the drug.
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:25.940]   They provide the drug.
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:28.780]   And then you have a CRO, a clinical research organization
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:32.620]   that is basically managing the trial.
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:35.540]   And the trial is being done at cancer centers
[02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:37.800]   all over the world or all over the country.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:41.760]   And, you know, enrollment I think began in 2008 for this.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:43.780]   No, no, I think it completed in 2008.
[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:47.280]   It probably started in about 2004, 2005.
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:49.140]   And therefore you had to kind of have
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:50.380]   real clear protocols around this.
[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:53.620]   So a complete response is the easier of these to understand.
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:58.620]   A complete response is everything vanishes completely.
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:03.280]   That's very rare in cancer therapy.
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:06.420]   So instead, what we kind of look for is a partial response.
[02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:07.580]   A partial response,
[02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:10.140]   and there are really different ways to define this.
[02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:11.260]   There are different criteria,
[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.760]   but this is the most common way
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:14.480]   you define a partial response.
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:19.480]   A partial response is at least a 50% reduction by diameter.
[02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:23.900]   'Cause remember in this type of imaging,
[02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:26.700]   you're looking at 2D versus 3D.
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:29.420]   So if you're looking at a lung lesion and it's this big,
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:31.420]   it has, you know, if it's two centimeters long,
[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:34.100]   it has to go to at least one centimeter in diameter.
[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:38.820]   So it's a 50% reduction at least of every single lesion
[02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:42.740]   with no new lesions appearing and no lesions growing.
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:45.440]   So it's very strict criteria, right?
[02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:48.380]   Again, CR means everything vanishes.
[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:52.300]   PR means at least a 50% by diameter,
[02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:54.420]   which by the way is a much bigger diameter,
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:56.980]   much bigger reduction in terms of tumor volume.
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:20:59.520]   When you consider the linear versus the third power
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:03.500]   relationship of length and volume of every single lesion
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:05.940]   with nothing new appearing regardless of how small
[02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:08.640]   and no lesion growing.
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:09.740]   So that's a PR.
[02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:14.100]   So you basically have no response, progression,
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:15.940]   you know, we talk about those together,
[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:18.960]   and then partial response and complete response.
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:23.140]   So initially the authors of this study were going to,
[02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:24.940]   the primary end point of this was going to be
[02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:26.700]   the best overall response rate.
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:29.940]   So what was the proportion of patients that hit PR?
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:32.560]   What was the proportion that hit a CR?
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:36.020]   That's very common in this type of paper
[02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:38.380]   where the outcomes are typically so dire.
[02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:41.300]   However, oh, I think I said,
[02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:43.160]   I think I said that the study was,
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:45.820]   I don't remember when the study ended,
[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:50.540]   but the amendment was made to change the primary end point
[02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:55.540]   to overall survival at some point during the study.
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:59.740]   So, and by the way, that tends to be the metric
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:01.540]   everybody cares most about.
[02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:06.540]   So the overall survival for metastatic melanoma is zero,
[02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:11.060]   with the exception of people who respond to interleukin-2,
[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:12.580]   high dose interleukin-2,
[02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:16.300]   and that will boost the overall survival rate
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:21.300]   to somewhere between eight and 10%, very, very low.
[02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:25.900]   These patients, many of whom had already taken
[02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:28.920]   and progressed through interleukin-2.
[02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:33.140]   Let me refresh my memory on what percentage
[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:35.140]   of those patients.
[02:22:35.140 --> 02:22:37.060]   About a quarter of these patients
[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:40.780]   had already taken high dose interleukin-2,
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:43.420]   and by definition, the fact that they're in this study
[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:45.460]   means they had already progressed through that.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.420]   That treatment had failed.
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:51.660]   Just reiterate just kind of the state these patients are in.
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:55.560]   So now let's look at figure one.
[02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:57.060]   So again, I'll describe it
[02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:59.460]   because I realized many people are just listening to us.
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:01.780]   All of this will be available both in the video,
[02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:03.760]   and then we'll link to the paper.
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:06.840]   So figure one is a figure that probably looks
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:10.460]   really familiar to people who look at any data
[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:11.440]   that deal with survival.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:14.200]   It's called the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:17.720]   So on the x-axis for this curve is time,
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:20.340]   and time here is shown in months,
[02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:23.820]   and on the y-axis is the overall survival.
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:27.720]   At the very top, 100%, at the bottom, 0%.
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:31.660]   And it has three graphs or three curves
[02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:33.540]   that are superimposed on one another.
[02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:34.880]   For each of the three groups.
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:38.100]   Again, the control group, which is the GP100,
[02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:41.020]   the anti-CTLA-4 group by itself,
[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:45.040]   and the anti-CTLA-4 plus GP100.
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:48.100]   And one of the characteristics of a Kaplan-Meier curve
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:50.640]   is by definition, they have to be decreasing
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.320]   in a monotonic fashion
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:54.320]   because it's cumulative overall survival.
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:57.740]   That just means it can't like come down and go back up.
[02:23:57.740 --> 02:23:59.020]   Nobody comes back to life.
[02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:03.320]   So once a person dies, they are censored from the study,
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:06.000]   and the curve drops and drops and drops.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.680]   And you can see that they kind of highlight,
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:09.160]   and I actually think it makes the graph
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:10.760]   a little harder to read
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:13.240]   when they put some of those marks on there.
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:16.880]   But what really becomes clear when you look at this
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:18.900]   is that there's a key,
[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:23.320]   there's a clear distinction between the curve
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:25.840]   for the placebo group, the GP100 group,
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:29.680]   and the other two, the two treatment groups.
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:32.840]   Now, you'll note at the very end
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:34.040]   that the two treatment groups
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:35.440]   appear to separate a little bit.
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:37.760]   I'll talk about that in a second.
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:39.620]   So when I look at these, Andrew,
[02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:41.640]   the first thing I always turn my attention to,
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:42.600]   I can't resist,
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:45.120]   I have to look at the right-hand side of the graph.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:46.940]   'Cause what is that really telling me, right?
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:50.380]   The tail of this is showing me the true overall survival.
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:53.680]   And I want to sort of figure out what is going on.
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:57.800]   So in the GP100 group, which is the placebo group,
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:24:59.500]   it is kind of amazing to think
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:03.960]   that there is still one person who is alive at 44 months.
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:05.840]   It's amazing.
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.780]   I mean, it's both sobering and amazing
[02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:10.520]   that like one person made it to 44 months.
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:13.360]   The next thing I ask myself is,
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:15.860]   well, how long did half of the people make it?
[02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:17.720]   That's called median survival.
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:21.560]   And to do that, you go up to the Y axis
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:24.720]   and you draw a little line from the 50 over,
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:27.040]   and then you bring that down.
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:30.100]   And that's awfully low.
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:31.360]   It's about, yeah.
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:34.480]   In fact, the table will tell us exactly what that is.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.920]   'Cause I think it's really hard to eyeball that stuff.
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.620]   So let's go to,
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:41.600]   so there's always a table that will accompany these things.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:44.220]   And let's pull up that table.
[02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:46.800]   I've got this paper spread out over so many things.
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:48.840]   That's adverse events.
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:50.640]   Where's our survival table here?
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:53.960]   Your two subgroup analysis of overall survival.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:56.120]   (silence)
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:59.760]   It would probably be helpful
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:01.240]   if I stapled these things together,
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:02.080]   'cause it would be easier.
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:03.020]   Well, this is always a trade-off.
[02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:05.960]   Actually, since this is a Journal Club episode,
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:08.000]   I will say that stapling helps,
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.020]   but it also prevents one from separating things out,
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:11.880]   writing in the margins.
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:14.000]   I like these little mini clips.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.400]   No financial relationship to the mini clips either.
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:18.880]   Just have to state that.
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:20.760]   'Cause I always get, if you don't say that,
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:22.120]   people will go, oh, you must have a stake
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:23.240]   in these mini clips.
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:24.480]   I like these little mini clips.
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:25.880]   In fact, I'm such a nerd.
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:30.680]   I always have one of these Pilot V5, V7s on my pocket,
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:31.520]   or my hip.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:33.180]   And then my pockets are always filled
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:36.160]   with these little mini clips.
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:38.640]   And, but then again, I have a friend who's a musician,
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:40.120]   and he's always raining guitar picks.
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:42.860]   So, you know, as far as occupational hazards go
[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.960]   of being a nerd, these mini clips are-
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:46.880]   I'm a big fan of the mini clip as well,
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:48.800]   but I went without it today.
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:49.640]   All right, so thank you.
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:51.000]   Yes, table two.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.400]   All right, so let's look at table two
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:55.920]   while looking at the Kaplan-Meier curve,
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:57.520]   'cause now this allows us to see a couple of things.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:00.480]   By the way, remember how I said there's like that one person
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:03.960]   who kind of is still alive in the treatment group?
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:08.000]   Well, you can tell that he's not a complete responder.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.040]   He or she is not a complete responder,
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:14.720]   because under evaluation of therapy in table two,
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:16.840]   it says best overall response,
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:19.640]   and it says complete responders, zero.
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:22.360]   So there was zero complete responders in the placebo.
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:24.960]   There were two partial responders.
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:29.720]   Again, a partial responder is some lesions got smaller,
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:30.780]   some got bigger.
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:35.720]   Stable disease is, it didn't really change that much.
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.960]   And progressive disease is obviously, it went beyond.
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:40.800]   Not-
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:43.320]   When you say partial response, like lesions got smaller,
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:47.560]   are they literally just tracing the circumference
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:49.760]   of one of these skin lesions and saying,
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:51.320]   okay, it got bigger, smaller?
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:53.440]   Literally, we'd had rulers in the clinic.
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:54.280]   Yep, yep.
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:57.360]   Gosh, this feels so crude in terms of like,
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:58.360]   I mean, it makes total sense,
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:00.240]   but like in terms of like modern medicine,
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:02.440]   oh, like your lesion grew from like three millimeters
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:04.960]   to six millimeters, and we're literally
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.140]   like drawing little boundaries
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:08.320]   around little blotches on the skin.
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.780]   Yeah, you're putting a little measuring tape on them.
[02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:12.480]   Now, again, most of these are happening
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:13.720]   in the radiology suite,
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:15.960]   'cause most of the disease for these patients
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:17.200]   is inside the body.
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:19.400]   Remember, more than 70% of these patients
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:21.280]   had visceral metastases.
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:26.280]   So liver, soft tissue, lung, brain, you know, these are,
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:29.980]   in fact, if you include lung, liver, brain, and viscera,
[02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:33.280]   it's pretty much all the patients.
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:35.080]   So most of this is looking at a CT scan
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:36.280]   or an MRI for the brain.
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:37.120]   Got it.
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:40.500]   Okay, so that's kind of the first thing that comes up.
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.440]   The median response rate should be shown
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:45.720]   pretty prominently here.
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:50.720]   So I'm looking through this, and where is median response?
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:56.040]   Maybe it's shown in a different table.
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:58.500]   Let's see.
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:04.060]   Not disease control rate, time to progression.
[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:08.120]   I remember it's about 10 months,
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:10.940]   but maybe that's just in the text.
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:12.160]   Yeah, here it is.
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:13.980]   So I thought this would be in a table,
[02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:17.420]   but it's on page 715 of the paper.
[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:18.800]   It just reports it.
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:21.200]   So, and I'm sorry, I misspoke.
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:27.040]   The 10 months was for the anti-CTLA-4 plus GP-100,
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:31.600]   and 6.4 months for the GP-100 alone.
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:32.760]   That's the control.
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:37.760]   And then 10.1 for the anti-CTLA-4 alone.
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:40.080]   Okay, so again, I always, and again,
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:41.060]   I'm just always doing this.
[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:42.720]   I'm kind of going back to the paper to be like,
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:43.600]   does that make sense?
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:45.300]   And yeah, you kind of called it, right?
[02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:47.420]   You said median survival was about eight.
[02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:50.400]   Well, it turns out it's actually like six and change,
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:52.700]   'cause it has that little ding in it,
[02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:55.140]   and it's out to a little past 10 on the two others.
[02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:57.140]   So the net takeaway here is,
[02:29:57.140 --> 02:29:59.020]   again, just to put that in English,
[02:29:59.020 --> 02:30:01.380]   'cause it's so profound,
[02:30:01.380 --> 02:30:04.640]   50% of the patients in the control group
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:06.380]   were dead in six months.
[02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:10.240]   50% of the patients in the treatment group,
[02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:13.680]   both treatment groups were dead in 10 months.
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:16.920]   So what that means in cancer speak is,
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:21.120]   these drugs extended median survival by four months.
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:25.600]   Now, that's an important concept.
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:30.080]   You know, when we think about how has cancer therapy changed
[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:31.880]   over the past 50 years,
[02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:34.640]   median survival for metastatic cancer
[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:36.840]   has increased across the board.
[02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:40.460]   So a person today with metastatic colorectal cancer,
[02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:43.480]   or a woman today with metastatic breast cancer,
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:45.700]   or a person with metastatic lung cancer,
[02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:50.740]   these people will live longer with those diseases today,
[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:53.360]   thanks mostly to treatments.
[02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:56.820]   This is not an early detection lead time bias issue.
[02:30:56.820 --> 02:31:01.120]   This is treatments allowing people to live longer.
[02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:04.180]   And that's an important part of the story,
[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:06.040]   but it's only half of the story,
[02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:08.960]   yet it often gets touted as the story.
[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:10.180]   The other half of the story,
[02:31:10.180 --> 02:31:12.220]   and frankly the story that I think is more important,
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:15.160]   is what is overall survival doing?
[02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:18.920]   And if you go back to those cancers, the answer is zero.
[02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:23.280]   So overall survival hasn't changed
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.080]   for solid epithelial tumors.
[02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:30.080]   It was 0% in 1970, and it's 0% today.
[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:32.360]   - Everyone dies.
[02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:36.040]   Everyone dies from metastatic solid organ tumors.
[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:38.240]   Now again, there's those niche examples I gave you.
[02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:40.720]   Testicular cancer is now an exception.
[02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:43.960]   GI stromal tumors would be an exception,
[02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:46.720]   and I'm not including leukemias and lymphomas,
[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:48.280]   where now there are exceptions.
[02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:53.000]   - Okay, within, not to try and be overly optimistic,
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.240]   but if I look at the graph in figure one,
[02:31:57.240 --> 02:31:59.320]   and I look out at the tail of the graph.
[02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:00.480]   - That's right.
[02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:01.760]   - And for those that are just listening,
[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:06.440]   what I see, and I'm far less, far less familiar
[02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:08.960]   with this type of work and this,
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.160]   analyzing these type of data.
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:12.560]   But what I see is that people in the placebo group,
[02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:15.140]   they're all dead, except that one.
[02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:18.000]   They're basically all dead at 44 months.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.440]   But when I look at the number,
[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:23.080]   how long it takes for everyone to be dead
[02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:25.440]   in the true treatment groups,
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:29.960]   it's like 50, looks like 53, 54 months or so.
[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:31.040]   - And they're not dead.
[02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:31.880]   - That's the point.
[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:32.700]   - They're hanging in there, right?
[02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:35.340]   So, because an extra,
[02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:40.340]   as somebody who lost both of my scientific advisors,
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:42.640]   two of the three, the other one, the suicide,
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:44.020]   we've talked about this before,
[02:32:44.020 --> 02:32:46.400]   but the other two to different cancers,
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:48.500]   both had the BRCA2 mutation, by the way,
[02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:53.720]   an extra eight to 10 months with your kids
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:56.760]   or with your spouse, or to quote unquote,
[02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:59.480]   get your affairs in order is a big deal.
[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:00.840]   I mean, it's still depressing in the sense
[02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:03.280]   that nobody survives long-term,
[02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:05.880]   but an extra 10 months,
[02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:08.480]   as long as one is not miserable in that time,
[02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:10.320]   completely miserable.
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:13.120]   I mean, that's an extra 10 months of living, right?
[02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:15.240]   - Well, and what's interesting here is,
[02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:17.880]   the observation period stops
[02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:20.160]   and some of these patients are still going.
[02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:22.720]   So, what you're highlighting is kind of the point
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:26.060]   I wanna make, which is overall survival
[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:28.480]   is the most important metric.
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:31.480]   And it's the highest bar, make no mistake about it,
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:35.040]   and it's certainly not the bar any drug company
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:38.000]   is ever going to wanna talk about for a cancer drug.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.200]   - But why not?
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:40.760]   - Because they don't, none of them work, right?
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.840]   Like we don't have, you know, like drugs-
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:44.100]   - They only wanna talk about cures.
[02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:44.940]   They don't wanna talk about-
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:46.160]   - No, they only wanna talk about median survival.
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:49.360]   They only wanna talk about extending median survival.
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:52.480]   And there are lots of people out there
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:55.320]   that are on this platform, I don't need to get onto it,
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:59.040]   but who will say like, look, it's a real racket in oncology
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:02.360]   today, where drugs that are extending median survival
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:06.000]   by four weeks are being put on the market
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.640]   at a tune of, you know, 50 to $100,000 per treatment.
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.760]   That's not uncommon in oncology.
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:14.280]   There was one drug that was approved for pancreatic cancer.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:17.520]   I believe it extended median survival by nine days
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:18.960]   and it costs $40,000.
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:21.600]   - And it's being advertised as significantly-
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:24.720]   - Yes, 'cause that was a statistical significant improvement
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:25.600]   in median survival.
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:27.280]   - So I'm just, yeah.
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:29.160]   - So it's, look, it's really understandable
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:31.820]   why people are very skeptical of the pharma industry.
[02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:35.400]   And I think, you know, a much more nuanced view is necessary.
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:37.920]   Clearly, I don't think pharma is all bad,
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:41.080]   but I really understand why people lose faith in pharma
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:43.840]   when, you know, these types of products
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:46.640]   somehow make regulatory approval.
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:49.100]   - Does insurance cover these kinds of drugs?
[02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:51.260]   - It can, in fact, it often does.
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.040]   It depends on the FDA approval, of course,
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:57.000]   and the indication, but a lot of times they do, right?
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.440]   So yeah, there's a societal cost to these things,
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:02.760]   but there's also a patient cost, right?
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:05.120]   So a lot of times insurance doesn't fully cover it
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:07.720]   and a patient has to bear the cost difference.
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:09.840]   And on top of that, you alluded to this a second ago,
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:11.620]   which is what if your quality of life
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:14.580]   is dramatically compromised as a result of this treatment?
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:17.640]   And yes, statistically, you're gonna live nine days longer
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:22.080]   or three weeks longer, but at what cost to your health
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:23.580]   in those final remaining days?
[02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:26.640]   And by the way, you're potentially straddling
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:30.220]   your loved ones with enormous debt in your absence.
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:32.320]   So it's a super complicated topic.
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:34.660]   - Yeah, there's a dignity component too.
[02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:36.480]   I mean, I've seen this in people dying.
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:38.640]   You know, at some point they become
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:41.760]   such a diminished version of their former selves
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:45.320]   that they don't wanna be seen by people that way.
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:50.320]   - So what is exciting about this drug,
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:53.080]   although this paper is not the one that shows it,
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:54.980]   the reason I chose this paper, Andrew,
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:58.500]   is because it was the first approval.
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:03.000]   A second drug came along that is an anti-PD-1 drug.
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.720]   That drug is called Keytruda.
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:06.960]   That drug turned out to be even better
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:10.140]   and has even a greater response rate,
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:13.360]   both in terms of median survival and overall survival.
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:15.460]   But this was the landmark paper.
[02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:18.600]   I also have a slight bias here,
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:21.160]   and I'll disclose in a moment why,
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:24.040]   but I think it just talks about very interesting biology.
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:25.720]   So let's talk about a couple of things
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:27.480]   that stuck out to me in this paper.
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:30.320]   The first thing that stuck out to me,
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:32.480]   and the authors didn't comment on it,
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:37.160]   unless they did and I missed it, is look at figure two.
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:42.160]   So figure two is the subgroup analyses
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:47.100]   where you're sort of showing a similar graph
[02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:49.380]   to the one you showed earlier,
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:51.900]   where you show the response rate
[02:36:51.900 --> 02:36:54.920]   or the change in response between the groups,
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:57.140]   and then you put the error bars on it.
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:36:59.260]   And this is where we talk about how,
[02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:01.160]   well, it's a 95% confidence interval,
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:03.080]   so does it touch the unity line?
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:05.540]   So these are called like tornado plots typically.
[02:37:05.540 --> 02:37:10.840]   And what you'll notice is that in the top,
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:15.840]   you're looking at sort of,
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:21.340]   it's comparing the anti-CTLA-4 with GP-100 versus the GP-100,
[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:22.180]   and in the bottom,
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:25.000]   you're looking at the anti-CTLA-4 versus the GP-100.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.120]   So at a glance, you can see GP-100 is not doing anything.
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:31.720]   I mean, that's the first takeaway of comparing A to B.
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:34.760]   What I find most interesting
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:37.640]   is look at the subgroup analysis of females.
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:40.000]   Notice that in females,
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.760]   while there's a trend towards risk reduction,
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:46.720]   and this is risk reduction for overall mortality.
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:48.100]   So again, I just want to restate that.
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:49.740]   The primary outcome of this trial
[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:51.540]   was changed to overall survival,
[02:37:51.540 --> 02:37:53.640]   which I think is the better outcome, by the way.
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:57.480]   And overall, for all patients,
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:02.480]   when you compare anti-CTLA-4 plus placebo versus placebo,
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:08.120]   there was a 31% risk reduction in overall mortality.
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.440]   That's the mathematical interpretation
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:14.120]   of what you're seeing at the tail end
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:15.520]   of that Kaplan-Meier curve.
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:16.720]   - Living longer.
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:17.560]   - Living longer.
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:19.200]   - And it sounds like a big difference.
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.240]   And in some sense it is a big difference.
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:22.800]   - Well, it is for those people
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:25.040]   because you're really looking at basically
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:29.440]   0% surviving in the placebo group
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:33.760]   versus 20% of people are still alive
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:36.560]   at 56 months in the treatment group.
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:39.560]   But look, that means 80% have died, right?
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:43.960]   But notice that, and sorry,
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:47.340]   when you just look at the anti-CTLA-4 plus GP-100
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:48.720]   in the subgroup B,
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:51.640]   that hazard ratio's even showing more compression.
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:56.480]   It's a 36% reduction in risk of death.
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:01.360]   But notice that the females did not reach significance.
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:05.120]   So in the first group, they barely do.
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:07.280]   And you can see that because the confidence interval
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:09.760]   runs from 0.55 to 0.92.
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.160]   And notice the error bar almost touches the line.
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:14.000]   And in the second one,
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.760]   it does not reach significance at all.
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:19.120]   So I actually went and kind of did a little reading
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:20.340]   on this after, and I said,
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:22.880]   "Hey, you know, how much did this study,
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:24.680]   was this an outlier study?"
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:27.060]   And it turned out it wasn't.
[02:39:27.060 --> 02:39:31.040]   And that about half the studies of anti-CTLA-4
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:34.320]   did indeed find that the drug was less effective
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:35.880]   in women than men.
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:36.720]   Which I found interesting.
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:40.800]   Now, I couldn't find any great explanation for it,
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:44.600]   but the most plausible explanations fit into two categories.
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:46.840]   The first are, maybe there are differences
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:49.300]   in the immune response to the drug,
[02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:51.040]   if you're a man or a woman.
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:54.120]   The second comes down to dosing.
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:55.260]   I should have said this at the outset,
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:57.400]   but of course these drugs are not like a pill,
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:58.840]   where it's like everybody gets, you know,
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:00.080]   50 milligrams of this.
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:02.160]   They're all dosed based on weight.
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:04.400]   So this study is dosed, I believe,
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:06.400]   at three milligrams per kilogram.
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:10.080]   And because most men are heavier than women,
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:12.460]   men are getting a higher dose than women.
[02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:17.520]   And weight and body surface area and immune system,
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:20.320]   like these things are not all perfectly linear.
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:24.520]   So I kind of wonder if this difference
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:27.220]   is simply explained by men, on average,
[02:40:27.220 --> 02:40:29.140]   getting a higher dose than women.
[02:40:29.140 --> 02:40:29.980]   - Interesting.
[02:40:29.980 --> 02:40:33.960]   - Last thing I want to talk about here
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:38.080]   is in table three.
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:41.640]   So table three, always an important table
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:42.800]   to look at in any paper,
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:45.760]   is what are the adverse outcomes, right?
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:47.320]   What are the adverse effects of the drug?
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:49.660]   - Yeah, I spent a little bit of time with this
[02:40:49.660 --> 02:40:51.280]   and I confess it.
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:53.280]   You know, I definitely don't want cancer
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:54.920]   to the extent that I can avoid it,
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:57.800]   but this table made me wonder whether or not
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:00.280]   I would also want to just avoid cancer treatment,
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:03.160]   given the life extension provided.
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:07.280]   I mean, these adverse events are pretty uncomfortable.
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:08.120]   They sound like it.
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:10.480]   - Yeah, so just to put in perspective,
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:12.920]   and you always have to kind of be mindful
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:16.280]   of how many of these adverse events are occurring in people
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:18.280]   just because their disease is progressing.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:19.520]   So the first thing I always want to look at
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:23.760]   is total adverse events in all three groups,
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:24.640]   not just grade.
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:28.320]   So grade three and grade four are real toxicities, right?
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:31.580]   Grade four toxicity is life-threatening toxicity, by the way.
[02:41:31.580 --> 02:41:33.700]   Grade three is pretty significant toxicity.
[02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:36.120]   Grade one and two, we typically just, you know,
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:37.400]   that's not that severe, right?
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.200]   A little rash to put some corticosteroids on it,
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:40.560]   it went away kind of thing.
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.780]   Okay, so in the treatment plus GP 100 group,
[02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:48.880]   98.4% of people reported some event.
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:51.420]   So all but 1.6%.
[02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:55.900]   In the anti-CTLA-4 group alone, it was 96.7%,
[02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:58.640]   so only 3.1% did not.
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:00.880]   But in the placebo group, it's 97%.
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:03.580]   So it's important to keep in mind, like, you know,
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:05.300]   everybody's having some adverse effect.
[02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:06.140]   Okay, well, what if you say,
[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:10.520]   well, let's just limit it to the most severe events?
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:13.580]   Well, let's just talk about grade four toxicities.
[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:16.900]   There were 6.1% of those in the placebo group,
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:20.120]   8.4% in the anti-CTLA-4 group,
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:23.180]   and 6.8% in the combined group.
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:26.840]   So not a huge difference in grade four toxicity.
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:30.280]   - Meaning that whatever adverse events are occurring
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:31.960]   may not be related to the treatment.
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:33.720]   - They may not be related to the treatment.
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:35.760]   Again, these are, if you think about it,
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:38.880]   and it's a very awful, sad, morbid thought to imagine,
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:42.920]   you're looking at the adverse responses of people,
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:44.600]   more than 80% of whom died
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:47.520]   during the course of a very, very short study.
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:51.360]   And so, you know, it's very difficult to disentangle
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:54.080]   what effects or what side effects a person is having
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:58.400]   just from that process as they are from the actual treatment.
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:01.420]   But if there is an area where there's a really clear
[02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:05.360]   difference, it's down in the autoimmune category.
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:08.840]   So if you look at any immune-related events,
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:13.840]   you can see that in the anti-CTLA-4 plus GP-100 group,
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:17.560]   it's about 60% in both of those treatment groups
[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:19.520]   versus 30%.
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:23.080]   And if you look at the grade three and four toxicities,
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:28.080]   it's 10% in the anti-CTLA-4, 15%,
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:32.040]   in the anti-CTLA-4 alone group,
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:34.240]   and only 3% in the treatment.
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:36.740]   So that's a real difference.
[02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:39.520]   - Well, it makes sense that people getting this drug
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.000]   plus placebo or just the drug would have autoimmune issues
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.920]   because this is an immunotherapy.
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:47.320]   - It's an immunomodulator.
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:48.340]   In fact, what is it doing?
[02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:51.680]   It is taking the brakes off the immune system.
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:54.760]   - But then again, the things that they list out,
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:57.640]   pruritis, is that a irritation of the skin?
[02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:59.120]   - Yeah, irritation of the skin.
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.040]   - I'm not a physician,
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:02.920]   but I know that any itis is gonna be like an inflammation.
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:07.080]   And OMA, unfortunately, likely a cancer or cell replication.
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:09.400]   - Look at the difference in vitiligo.
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:12.640]   - I mean, wow.
[02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:14.040]   Yeah, so very little.
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:16.640]   - Sorry, sorry, look at the gastrointestinal differences.
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:18.200]   Yeah, and the vitiligo, right?
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:21.680]   So 3.7%, 2.3%, 0.8%.
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:23.880]   The GI stuff is the most common stuff
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:24.960]   you're gonna see there.
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:26.420]   Those are the really big ones.
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:28.760]   - And of course there's diarrhea and there's diarrhea.
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:29.600]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:31.000]   - Like there's traveler's diarrhea,
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.280]   there's, you know, ate an overly spicy large meal
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:35.280]   the night before diarrhea.
[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:38.040]   And then there's like, can't really do anything
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:40.080]   besides make trips back and forth to the bathroom.
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:41.500]   - Well, put it this way.
[02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:44.440]   There's, you know, colitis here is diarrhea so significant.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:46.380]   These patients require IV fluids.
[02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:49.160]   Now, what you don't see here is how many of these patients
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:50.800]   actually required corticosteroids
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:52.840]   to reverse the autoimmunity.
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:54.960]   So a lot of times what'll happen here in these studies
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:57.320]   or with these drugs is the autoimmunity becomes
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:00.300]   so significant that you have to stop the drug
[02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:02.040]   and give corticosteroids.
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:02.980]   Do the exact opposite.
[02:45:02.980 --> 02:45:05.220]   You now have to shut the immune system down.
[02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:07.820]   So you just took the brakes off it with the drug
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:10.520]   and now you need to shut it down with corticosteroids.
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.420]   When I was, was I in med school?
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:17.240]   No, when I was in my fellowship,
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:23.680]   I wrote a paper about autoimmunity correlating
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:29.160]   with response rate in anti-CTLA-4 early on.
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:31.280]   This was during the phase two work.
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.480]   So, you know, so the NCI was a very early
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:40.700]   adopter of participating in these trials.
[02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:45.280]   And, you know, it was observed that,
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:46.380]   or at least hypothesized,
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:48.380]   this is what the paper basically wrote about,
[02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:50.520]   which was, is there any correlation
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:53.800]   between autoimmunity and response?
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:55.440]   And it turned out the answer was yes.
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:56.860]   There was a very strong correlation.
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:46:01.840]   So there was no difference in autoimmunity
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:03.240]   between the doses.
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:07.140]   And so the paper we wrote was two dosing schedules.
[02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:08.560]   So it was basically the full dose,
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:10.800]   the three milligrams per kilogram versus a low dose,
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:11.740]   one milligram per kilogram.
[02:46:11.740 --> 02:46:12.960]   This is a phase two trial.
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:14.560]   Those are your two arms.
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:15.940]   There turned out to be no difference
[02:46:15.940 --> 02:46:17.820]   in autoimmunity between them,
[02:46:17.820 --> 02:46:20.600]   but there was a big difference between
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:26.320]   the response rate that tied to autoimmunity.
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:30.220]   In other words, autoimmunity predicted response.
[02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:34.660]   Now, I think over time, these investigators,
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:36.000]   the doctors who administer these treatments,
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.040]   are getting better and better
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:38.760]   at catching these things earlier,
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:40.880]   because these autoimmune conditions
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:42.200]   can actually be devastating.
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:44.440]   So on a very personal note,
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:48.280]   when Kytruda came out,
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:50.240]   I want to say it was around 2011,
[02:46:52.100 --> 02:46:55.880]   no, no, no, gosh, it must've been 2013, 2014, thereabouts.
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:00.600]   Again, it was for treatment of metastatic melanoma.
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:02.640]   I want to come back and explain why melanoma
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:04.840]   gets all of the attention in autoimmune condition,
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:07.700]   in immunotherapy conditions, I'll state that.
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:12.700]   But anyway, a friend of mine got pancreatic cancer,
[02:47:12.700 --> 02:47:17.420]   and he got the bad type of pancreatic cancer.
[02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:22.420]   So this is like the adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
[02:47:22.420 --> 02:47:26.000]   So this is a non-survivable type of cancer.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.040]   Furthermore, his was unresectable, so--
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:30.400]   - Can you explain what that is?
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:35.400]   - Yeah, so about 20% of people who have pancreatic cancer
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:38.040]   technically have it in a way
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:40.280]   where you could still take out the head of the pancreas.
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:41.320]   - The Whipple procedure.
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:43.380]   - The Whipple procedure, right.
[02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:46.180]   Now, tragically, most of those patients will still recur.
[02:47:46.180 --> 02:47:49.840]   My understanding is that pancreatic cancer
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.680]   progresses from anterior to posterior in the pancreas,
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:55.240]   and that the Whipple is a removal
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:47:56.960]   of the front and the anterior.
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:47:58.320]   That's the Whipple procedure.
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:02.100]   So if the cancer has progressed far enough caudal
[02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:04.400]   into the posterior pancreas,
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:07.120]   then there's nothing left to cut out, basically.
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:10.700]   Can we survive without a pancreas for any amount of time?
[02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:11.540]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:48:11.540 --> 02:48:13.160]   - So why don't they just remove the whole pancreas?
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:16.340]   - Oh, that's my point, it's already micrometastisized.
[02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:18.660]   So it's not, the surgical procedure
[02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:20.940]   is not the challenge anymore, it used to be.
[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:23.080]   So, you know, at Johns Hopkins,
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.940]   which is one of the hospitals where this was pioneered,
[02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:29.060]   like, the 30-day mortality for a Whipple procedure
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:33.100]   was, I don't know, 80%.
[02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:36.020]   And the reason was to figure out
[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:40.660]   how to suture a pancreas to the bowel without the,
[02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:43.840]   so the pancreas is such an awful organ to operate on,
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:46.000]   because its enzymes are designed
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:47.960]   to digest anything and everything.
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:52.000]   So imagine now you have to cut the pancreas in half,
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.760]   take out the head of the pancreas with the duodenum,
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:59.320]   and then, somehow, sew that open half of a raw pancreas
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:03.820]   to the end of the jejunum, and not let it digest itself.
[02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:05.960]   - Someone at Hopkins figured this out?
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:09.320]   - No, the first one was actually done by A.O. Whipple,
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:12.980]   but yes, at Hopkins is where they figured out
[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:16.820]   the way to put drains in, the surgical technique,
[02:49:16.820 --> 02:49:19.840]   how to do it in two layers, what type of stitches to use,
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:23.080]   like, all of the nuances of this were worked out
[02:49:23.080 --> 02:49:24.900]   in a few places, but I would say Hopkins
[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:26.240]   more than any place else.
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:28.600]   - And are there physicians who, like,
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:30.740]   try this on non-human primates or something,
[02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:32.760]   or is this always just done on patients, and you keep trying?
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.280]   - Well, nowadays, I mean, put it this way,
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:39.280]   even 25 years ago, at a major center like Hopkins,
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:42.800]   the mortality of that procedure was less than 1%.
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:43.640]   - Amazing. - Yeah, totally amazing.
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:45.300]   - So there have been some victories.
[02:49:45.300 --> 02:49:47.120]   - Well, yes, but here's my point.
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:49.300]   That's no longer the bottleneck, right?
[02:49:49.300 --> 02:49:50.840]   Taking out the pancreas safely,
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:52.800]   as complicated and challenging as that is,
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:54.360]   and if you need a Whipple procedure,
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:56.080]   you only want to have it done by someone
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:57.820]   who just does that night and day,
[02:49:57.820 --> 02:50:00.320]   'cause you don't want weekend warriors doing it.
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:03.880]   That's not why people are living or dying.
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:06.640]   They're dying because the cancer just comes back.
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:08.640]   It was already spread to the liver
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:09.600]   by the time you did it.
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:11.680]   You just didn't realize it yet.
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:13.380]   So whether you took out the whole pancreas,
[02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:15.560]   or the head of the pancreas, or the tail of the pancreas,
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:20.560]   the location of the tumor is predictive of survival,
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:25.240]   only in the extent that it basically is a window
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:27.220]   into how soon did symptoms occur.
[02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:32.160]   So pancreatic cancers in the tail tend to be more fatal,
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:36.180]   even though they're way easier surgically to take out,
[02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:39.000]   because by the time you develop symptoms
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.680]   of a tail pancreas cancer, it's a big cancer.
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:44.860]   - I was gonna ask this question later,
[02:50:44.860 --> 02:50:46.780]   but I'll just ask it now.
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:50.520]   Given the link between the immune system and these cancers,
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:54.800]   is there an idea in mind that people who are,
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:59.140]   let's say, 40 and older, or 50 and older,
[02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:02.700]   who don't yet, they're not diagnosed with any cancer,
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:06.240]   would periodically just stimulate their immune system
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:10.840]   to wipe out whatever early cancers might be cropping up?
[02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:13.680]   Just take a drug to just ramp up the immune system,
[02:51:13.680 --> 02:51:15.760]   even to the point where you start having a little diarrhea,
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:19.920]   maybe a few skin rashes, and then come off the drug,
[02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:24.040]   just basically to fight back whatever little cell growths
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:26.440]   are starting to take place in skin or liver,
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:30.680]   maybe for three weeks out of each year.
[02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:32.480]   I mean, why not?
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:34.740]   - Yeah, it's an interesting question.
[02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:36.540]   I've never thought of it through that lens.
[02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:39.980]   I suppose the question is, what can we do
[02:51:39.980 --> 02:51:42.940]   to keep our immune systems as healthy as possible
[02:51:42.940 --> 02:51:43.780]   as we age, because--
[02:51:43.780 --> 02:51:45.900]   - Stay on a normal circadian schedule.
[02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:47.040]   There's evidence for that.
[02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:49.000]   - Sure, no, there's evidence that,
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.420]   certainly if it promotes sleep,
[02:51:50.420 --> 02:51:52.220]   anything that promotes better rest
[02:51:52.220 --> 02:51:54.000]   is going to promote immune health.
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.380]   Because if you ask the macro question,
[02:51:57.380 --> 02:51:59.480]   which is like, why does the prevalence of cancer
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:02.440]   increase so dramatically with age?
[02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:06.480]   There are certain diseases where it's really obvious
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:08.840]   why the prevalence of the disease increases with age.
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:11.680]   - Yeah, like age-related macular degeneration.
[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:15.240]   - Sure, or cardiovascular disease is by far the most obvious
[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:17.760]   because it's an area under the curve exposure problem.
[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:19.240]   The more exposure to lipoproteins
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:21.680]   and the more the endothelium gets damaged,
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:23.400]   the more likely you are to accumulate plaque.
[02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:25.120]   And again, it totally makes sense
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:27.520]   why 10-year-olds don't have heart attacks
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:28.780]   and 80-year-olds do.
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:33.060]   But when you sort of acknowledge that,
[02:52:33.060 --> 02:52:37.880]   well, hey, anybody's accumulating genetic mutations.
[02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:40.820]   We're always surrounded and being bombarded by things
[02:52:40.820 --> 02:52:43.020]   that are altering the genome of ourselves.
[02:52:43.020 --> 02:52:45.500]   Is it simply a stochastic process
[02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:46.860]   where the longer you live,
[02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:48.600]   the more of these mutations you're going to occur
[02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:51.360]   until at some point one of them just wins?
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:53.980]   I think that's got to be a big part of it.
[02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:55.660]   But I think another part of it,
[02:52:55.660 --> 02:52:57.940]   and clearly I'm not alone in thinking this,
[02:52:57.940 --> 02:52:59.980]   is that our immune system's getting weaker and weaker
[02:52:59.980 --> 02:53:01.200]   as we age, right?
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:05.100]   I mean, people become more susceptible to infections
[02:53:05.100 --> 02:53:06.540]   as they get older.
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:09.660]   And I think that that's equally playing a role
[02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:11.260]   in our susceptibility to cancer.
[02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:12.780]   So yeah, I think the question is
[02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:17.100]   how do you modulate immunity as you age?
[02:53:17.100 --> 02:53:19.020]   And to me, that's one of the most interesting things
[02:53:19.020 --> 02:53:21.420]   about rapamycin potentially is that
[02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:22.680]   when taken the right way,
[02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:26.860]   it seems to enhance cellular immunity,
[02:53:26.860 --> 02:53:29.180]   which again, that's potentially a really big deal.
[02:53:29.180 --> 02:53:32.180]   Again, at least in short-term human experiments
[02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:35.700]   in response to vaccination, it's enhancing vaccine response.
[02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:38.580]   So the question is, would that translate into cancer?
[02:53:38.580 --> 02:53:39.860]   Nobody knows.
[02:53:39.860 --> 02:53:41.440]   Could that be one of the reasons
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:44.580]   why animals treated with rapamycin live longer
[02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:45.860]   and get less cancer?
[02:53:45.860 --> 02:53:46.700]   Don't know.
[02:53:46.700 --> 02:53:49.120]   You know, it could also be that it's at a fundamental level
[02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:50.820]   that's targeting nutrient sensing.
[02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:54.860]   Where I was going with that story was that,
[02:53:56.420 --> 02:53:57.940]   maybe I'll back up for a moment.
[02:53:57.940 --> 02:53:59.140]   Why melanoma?
[02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:05.060]   So we didn't really know this like 30, 40 years ago
[02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:07.860]   in the early days of immunotherapy.
[02:54:07.860 --> 02:54:11.820]   But what we know now is that most cancers
[02:54:11.820 --> 02:54:14.860]   probably have about 40 mutations in them.
[02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:15.760]   That's like ballpark.
[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:20.140]   40, 50 mutations is standard fare for a cancer.
[02:54:20.140 --> 02:54:23.020]   But melanoma happens to be one of the cancers
[02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:25.740]   that has many, many more mutations.
[02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:28.340]   And the more mutations a cancer has,
[02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:31.380]   the more likelihood that it will produce an antigen
[02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:33.860]   that's recognized as non-self.
[02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:37.460]   And that's why in the early days of immunotherapy,
[02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:40.140]   the only things that worked were IL-2
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:42.100]   against metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer,
[02:54:42.100 --> 02:54:44.260]   because kidney cancer turned out to also be
[02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:47.840]   one of those cancers that, for reasons that are not clear,
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:50.900]   produced hundreds of mutations.
[02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:53.700]   And so it's no surprise that the early studies
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:55.940]   of checkpoint inhibitors were also done in
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:57.280]   metastatic melanoma,
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:54:59.900]   where you basically have more shots on goal.
[02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:03.020]   Again, if I'm going to take the breaks off my immune system,
[02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:05.360]   I might as well do it in an environment
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:08.140]   where there are more chances for my T cells
[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:10.640]   to find something to go nuts against.
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:16.660]   So it's 2013, 2014, and this friend of mine
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:19.700]   who has something called Lynch syndrome,
[02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:24.640]   which is one of those few hereditary or germline mutations
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:27.060]   that results in a huge increase in the risk of cancer.
[02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:30.460]   He had already had colon cancer at about the age of 40
[02:55:30.460 --> 02:55:33.120]   and had survived that.
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:35.620]   It was a stage three cancer, but he had survived it.
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:37.820]   Well, now, five years later,
[02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:41.220]   had developed pancreatic cancer.
[02:55:41.220 --> 02:55:44.300]   And when he went to see the surgeon, they said,
[02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:45.980]   "Yeah, there's nothing we can do.
[02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:48.300]   "Like, it's too advanced."
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:50.580]   So that's, you know, to put that in perspective,
[02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:52.000]   that is a death sentence.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:56.300]   And that's not, that's a six month survival.
[02:55:56.300 --> 02:55:59.020]   And at around that time,
[02:55:59.020 --> 02:56:00.380]   there was a study that had come out
[02:56:00.380 --> 02:56:01.780]   in the New England Journal of Medicine
[02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:04.820]   that had talked about how patients with Lynch syndrome
[02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:07.260]   had lots of mutations.
[02:56:07.260 --> 02:56:11.340]   And so we, you know, talked with his doctors
[02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:13.540]   about the possibility of enrolling him
[02:56:13.540 --> 02:56:15.740]   in one of the Kytruda trials.
[02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:17.840]   There was one going on, I think, at Stanford.
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:20.440]   And, you know, the thinking being,
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:22.500]   well, you know, you would want to target
[02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:24.560]   a checkpoint inhibitor against somebody
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:25.700]   who has a lot of mutations.
[02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:27.180]   And even though typically we don't see that
[02:56:27.180 --> 02:56:30.760]   in pancreatic cancer, his is a unique variant of it
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:32.360]   because it's based on this.
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:34.400]   And so sure enough, he was tested
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.380]   for these mismatch repair genes.
[02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:40.020]   He had them enrolled in the trial and amazingly,
[02:56:40.020 --> 02:56:42.900]   had not only a complete regression of his cancer,
[02:56:42.900 --> 02:56:46.420]   and he's still alive and cancer free today, 10 years later.
[02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:50.440]   But the treatment worked so well
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:52.120]   at activating his immune system
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:55.080]   that his immune system completely destroyed his pancreas.
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:57:00.120]   So now he has effectively had a pancreatectomy
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:01.200]   based on his immune system.
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:03.880]   So now he actually has type one diabetes.
[02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:05.180]   He has no pancreas.
[02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:06.980]   - He injects insulin to deal with it?
[02:57:06.980 --> 02:57:10.160]   - Yeah, no, he has to use insulin
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:11.000]   just like someone with type one diabetes.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.620]   - Okay, but he had to pick being alive
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:14.140]   with type one diabetes.
[02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:15.600]   - Yeah, of course, and no comparison.
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:17.540]   But it's just an interesting example
[02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:22.040]   of how remarkable this treatment was able to work
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:24.460]   when you could completely unleash
[02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:26.560]   the immune system of a person
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:29.320]   and you eradicate the cancer
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:31.440]   and the rest of the cells around it.
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:35.400]   And there are many organs we could live without.
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:38.460]   There are certain organs you can't live without.
[02:57:38.460 --> 02:57:41.660]   You can't live without your heart, lungs, liver, kidneys.
[02:57:41.660 --> 02:57:45.820]   But many things that kill people arise from organs,
[02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:48.140]   the breast, you could live without all breast tissue.
[02:57:48.140 --> 02:57:48.980]   - Prostate.
[02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:49.820]   - Prostate, you can live without all prostate tissue.
[02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:52.940]   - No one would choose to live without these, but--
[02:57:52.940 --> 02:57:55.560]   - Right, but I'm saying if you had metastatic cancer
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:00.180]   and you had a bullet that could selectively target a tissue,
[02:58:00.180 --> 02:58:01.020]   you would take it.
[02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:04.340]   And right now, the only tissue we can do that against
[02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:08.060]   is a CD19 B cell, and that's what those CAR T cells are.
[02:58:08.060 --> 02:58:10.580]   So right now, these are not tissue-specific treatments,
[02:58:10.580 --> 02:58:13.020]   but they're mutation-specific.
[02:58:13.020 --> 02:58:14.100]   The last thing I'll say about this paper
[02:58:14.100 --> 02:58:16.620]   that I found interesting, and I was looking for it
[02:58:16.620 --> 02:58:19.500]   and I was surprised, they didn't at all comment
[02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:20.900]   on if there was any correlation
[02:58:20.900 --> 02:58:22.700]   between autoimmunity and response.
[02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:28.140]   So they obviously acknowledge the autoimmunity in table three
[02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:31.060]   but I would have loved to have seen a statistical analysis
[02:58:31.060 --> 02:58:33.540]   that said, "Hey, is there any correlation
[02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:35.660]   "between response rate and autoimmunity?"
[02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:38.460]   But they didn't comment to that effect.
[02:58:38.460 --> 02:58:40.560]   So we're left kind of wondering
[02:58:40.560 --> 02:58:43.300]   what the current state of that is.
[02:58:43.300 --> 02:58:46.400]   And I guess in summary, I'll say that the reason
[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:49.000]   I thought this was an interesting paper to present
[02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:52.460]   is that I still believe that immunotherapy
[02:58:52.460 --> 02:58:56.820]   is probably the most important hope we have
[02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:59.460]   for treating cancer.
[02:58:59.460 --> 02:59:01.340]   And while I think we're still only scratching
[02:59:01.340 --> 02:59:04.260]   the surface of it, so collectively,
[02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:07.060]   the overall survival increase for patients
[02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:09.460]   with metastatic solid organ tumors
[02:59:09.460 --> 02:59:13.340]   is about 8% better than it was 50 years ago.
[02:59:13.340 --> 02:59:15.420]   And virtually all of that has come from
[02:59:15.420 --> 02:59:19.860]   some form of immunotherapy, I think is promising.
[02:59:19.860 --> 02:59:24.220]   And I think the holy grail, meaning the next step,
[02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:27.060]   if you go back to where we started the discussion,
[02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:32.060]   is coming up with ways to engineer T cells
[02:59:32.060 --> 02:59:36.900]   to be even better recognizers of antigens.
[02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:38.340]   And there's many ways to do that.
[02:59:38.340 --> 02:59:40.440]   One is to directly engineer them.
[02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:42.880]   Another is to find T cells
[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:45.020]   that have already migrated into tumors.
[02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:48.620]   Those are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL.
[02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:52.300]   And expanding those and engineering them
[02:59:52.300 --> 02:59:53.860]   to be better and younger.
[02:59:53.860 --> 02:59:56.820]   - Is it possible to engineer our own T cells
[02:59:56.820 --> 03:00:00.100]   to be more pH variant tolerant?
[03:00:00.100 --> 03:00:05.100]   Meaning, since this cloaking of a local area
[03:00:05.140 --> 03:00:09.380]   by changing the pH, could we pull some T cells?
[03:00:09.380 --> 03:00:11.380]   I'm always thinking about the inoculation stuff,
[03:00:11.380 --> 03:00:14.920]   like pull some T cells as part of our standard exam
[03:00:14.920 --> 03:00:19.220]   when we're 30 and grow some up in an environment
[03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:24.180]   that the pH is slightly more acidic than normal,
[03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:26.300]   and then reintroduce them to the body.
[03:00:26.300 --> 03:00:28.340]   I mean, after all, they are our T cells.
[03:00:28.340 --> 03:00:33.260]   In other words, give them a little opportunity to evolve
[03:00:33.260 --> 03:00:36.180]   so that the conditions they can thrive in, right?
[03:00:36.180 --> 03:00:38.500]   Or even just keep them in the freezer in case we need them.
[03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:40.260]   - Yes, so the interesting thing is,
[03:00:40.260 --> 03:00:43.260]   I don't know that if you just got them to be comfortable
[03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:45.360]   in a lower pH, it would be sufficient,
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:49.620]   because there are still so many other things
[03:00:49.620 --> 03:00:51.660]   that the cancer is doing
[03:00:51.660 --> 03:00:54.980]   as far as using other secreting factors.
[03:00:54.980 --> 03:00:59.340]   It seems that by far the most potent thing
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:03.680]   comes down to expanding the number of T cells
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:05.880]   that recognize the antigen,
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:09.580]   and making sure that you can get that number big enough
[03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:11.180]   without aging them too much.
[03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:13.340]   So in some senses, it has become
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:15.980]   a longevity problem of T cells.
[03:01:15.980 --> 03:01:20.580]   The way to think about it is you want an army of soldiers
[03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:24.420]   who are wise enough to recognize the bad guys,
[03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:29.180]   which comes with age, but young enough to go and kill.
[03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:33.880]   And right now, both extremes seem to be unhelpful, right?
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:36.380]   When you go and find tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:38.220]   in a tumor, they're very wise.
[03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:39.380]   They know which one.
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:41.700]   They've demonstrated that they can do everything.
[03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:43.500]   They can outmaneuver the cancer,
[03:01:43.500 --> 03:01:46.100]   but they're too old to do anything about it.
[03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:47.940]   And when you take them out to try to expand them
[03:01:47.940 --> 03:01:50.340]   by three logs, which is typically what you need to do,
[03:01:50.340 --> 03:01:53.300]   expand them by a thousand fold, they can't do anything.
[03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:54.140]   - Got it.
[03:01:54.140 --> 03:01:55.740]   And what about avoiding melanoma altogether?
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:57.500]   I mean, obviously avoiding sunburn.
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:00.880]   Somehow I got couched as anti-sunscreen
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:02.820]   and that is absolutely not true.
[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:05.660]   I said some sunscreens contain things
[03:02:05.660 --> 03:02:08.700]   that are clearly immune disrupt, endocrine, excuse me,
[03:02:08.700 --> 03:02:11.580]   disruptors, and we're gonna do a whole episode on sunscreen.
[03:02:11.580 --> 03:02:12.980]   Maybe we could do some journal clubs on them.
[03:02:12.980 --> 03:02:14.860]   - It's funny, I think I'm actually planning something
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:15.680]   on that as well.
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:16.520]   I wanna do a deep dive on that.
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:18.420]   - Yeah, I mean, and some dermatologists reached out,
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:21.220]   some very, very skilled dermatologists reached out
[03:02:21.220 --> 03:02:24.660]   and said that indeed some sunscreens are downright dangerous,
[03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:27.140]   but of course melanoma is super dangerous.
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:29.680]   Physical barrier, no one disputes physical barriers
[03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:33.020]   for sunscreen, like everyone agrees that that is unlikely
[03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:34.660]   to have endocrine disruption.
[03:02:34.660 --> 03:02:37.540]   So physical barriers are undisputed,
[03:02:37.540 --> 03:02:42.540]   but aside from limiting sunlight exposure to the skin,
[03:02:42.540 --> 03:02:46.080]   what are some other risks for melanoma?
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:47.280]   - I mean, I think that's the biggest one.
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:50.560]   I do not believe that smoking poses a risk for melanoma
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:53.140]   and if it does, it's gonna be very small.
[03:02:53.140 --> 03:02:56.300]   There are hereditary cases, so one needs to be pretty
[03:02:56.300 --> 03:02:58.060]   mindful when taking a family history.
[03:02:58.060 --> 03:03:02.500]   And by the way, there are really weird genetic conditions
[03:03:02.500 --> 03:03:04.780]   that link melanoma to other cancers,
[03:03:04.780 --> 03:03:06.520]   such as pancreatic cancer, by the way.
[03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:08.820]   So whenever I'm taking somebody's family history
[03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:11.040]   and I hear about somebody that had melanoma
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:13.600]   and someone that had pancreatic cancer,
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:16.820]   there's a couple of genetic tests we'll look at
[03:03:16.820 --> 03:03:19.740]   to see if that's a person that's particularly sensitive
[03:03:19.740 --> 03:03:23.180]   just from a genetic predisposition.
[03:03:23.180 --> 03:03:25.580]   But I do think that first and foremost it's,
[03:03:25.580 --> 03:03:28.340]   and by the way, I think with melanoma,
[03:03:28.340 --> 03:03:31.460]   although it's not completely agreed upon,
[03:03:31.460 --> 03:03:34.180]   I think it's less about sun exposure
[03:03:34.180 --> 03:03:36.640]   and more about sunburn, right?
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:39.100]   So, and again, I'm sure there's somebody listening to this
[03:03:39.100 --> 03:03:43.860]   who will chime in and apply a more nuanced response to that.
[03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:45.900]   But I think there's a fundamental difference
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:48.380]   between I'm out in the sun getting sun,
[03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:52.140]   making some vitamin D versus I'm getting scorched
[03:03:52.140 --> 03:03:55.700]   and undergoing significant UV damage.
[03:03:55.700 --> 03:03:57.460]   There might also be something to be said
[03:03:57.460 --> 03:03:58.960]   for the time in one's life.
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:01.240]   And I've certainly seen things that suggest
[03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:05.620]   that early repeated sunburns would be more of a risk.
[03:04:05.620 --> 03:04:10.640]   So look, I think that's not a controversial point
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:13.280]   in the sense that like who wants to be sunburned, right?
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:15.800]   So it's like whatever one needs to do to be sunburned,
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:20.100]   whether it's being mindful of what the UV index is,
[03:04:20.100 --> 03:04:23.380]   wearing the appropriate sunscreen.
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:28.020]   I also find the whole kind of anti-sunscreen establishment
[03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:29.620]   to be a little bit odd.
[03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:32.420]   - Well, the anti-sunscreen establishment is odd.
[03:04:32.420 --> 03:04:34.980]   I'm trying to open the door for a nuanced discussion
[03:04:34.980 --> 03:04:36.660]   about the fact that some sunscreens
[03:04:36.660 --> 03:04:39.780]   really do contain things like oxybenzines
[03:04:39.780 --> 03:04:40.620]   and things that are real.
[03:04:40.620 --> 03:04:42.860]   - Yeah, but when you're spraying them on kids.
[03:04:42.860 --> 03:04:45.140]   - Yeah, but when you just look at the straight,
[03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:47.740]   the good old fashioned mineral sunscreens.
[03:04:47.740 --> 03:04:49.060]   - Perfectly safe.
[03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:50.180]   - As far as we know.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:55.180]   I mean, I also dare we cross the seed oil debate into this.
[03:04:55.180 --> 03:04:57.860]   Some of the folks who are really anti-seed oil
[03:04:57.860 --> 03:05:01.380]   also claim that seed oils increase risk for sunscreen.
[03:05:01.380 --> 03:05:04.740]   Peter and I are smiling because we have teed up
[03:05:04.740 --> 03:05:10.220]   a debate soon with some anti-seed oil
[03:05:10.220 --> 03:05:13.180]   and less anti-seed oil experts.
[03:05:13.180 --> 03:05:14.620]   So that's forthcoming.
[03:05:14.620 --> 03:05:15.740]   That's gonna be a fun one.
[03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:18.040]   I will be doing all of that with our shirts on.
[03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:19.680]   (laughing)
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:22.560]   - I really appreciate you walking us through this paper,
[03:05:22.560 --> 03:05:25.560]   Peter, I've never looked at a paper on cancer
[03:05:25.560 --> 03:05:28.120]   and certainly not one like this.
[03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:33.120]   I learned a lot and it's such an interesting field,
[03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:34.960]   obviously because of the importance of getting people
[03:05:34.960 --> 03:05:37.720]   with cancer to survive longer and lead better lives,
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:41.440]   but also because of the interaction with the immune system.
[03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:43.760]   So we learned some really important immunology.
[03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:45.440]   - Yeah, and this was great.
[03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:50.720]   I feel much more confident now in the belief
[03:05:50.720 --> 03:05:54.840]   that the exposure to light early and late in the day
[03:05:54.840 --> 03:05:56.160]   can actually have benefits.
[03:05:56.160 --> 03:06:00.720]   And as I said, I think that there's some causality here
[03:06:00.720 --> 03:06:02.560]   and I think it shouldn't be ignored.
[03:06:02.560 --> 03:06:05.280]   - Cool, well, this was our second journal club.
[03:06:05.280 --> 03:06:07.160]   I look forward to our third.
[03:06:07.160 --> 03:06:09.760]   Next time you'll go first, we'll just keep alternating.
[03:06:09.760 --> 03:06:11.200]   And we've also switched venues,
[03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:13.820]   but we both wore the correct shirt.
[03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:18.440]   And I hope people are learning
[03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:21.240]   and not just learning the information,
[03:06:21.240 --> 03:06:23.240]   but learning how to parse and think about papers.
[03:06:23.240 --> 03:06:24.920]   And I certainly learned from you, Peter.
[03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:25.880]   Thank you so much.
[03:06:25.880 --> 03:06:27.280]   - Yeah, thanks, Endor, this was great.
[03:06:27.280 --> 03:06:28.160]   - Thank you for joining me

[03:07:01.360 --> 03:07:02.560]   Not on today's episode,
[03:07:02.560 --> 03:07:05.120]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:07:05.120 --> 03:07:06.640]   we discuss supplements.
[03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:08.840]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:07:08.840 --> 03:07:10.960]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:07:10.960 --> 03:07:13.800]   for things like improving sleep, for hormone support,
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:14.860]   and for focus.
[03:07:14.860 --> 03:07:16.120]   To learn more about the supplements
[03:07:16.120 --> 03:07:17.440]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:20.080]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S.
[03:07:20.080 --> 03:07:23.280]   So that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[03:07:23.280 --> 03:07:25.260]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:07:25.260 --> 03:07:28.320]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[03:07:28.320 --> 03:07:29.800]   So that's Instagram, Twitter,
[03:07:29.800 --> 03:07:32.800]   now called X, Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:34.280]   And on all of those platforms,
[03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:36.600]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:07:36.600 --> 03:07:38.040]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:39.280]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:07:39.280 --> 03:07:41.280]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:07:41.280 --> 03:07:42.740]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:07:42.740 --> 03:07:45.800]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:07:45.800 --> 03:07:46.940]   If you haven't already subscribed

[03:07:53.280 --> 03:07:55.380]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[03:07:55.380 --> 03:07:57.080]   one to three page PDFs
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:07:59.040]   for things like how to improve sleep,
[03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:01.800]   how to regulate dopamine, deliberate cold exposure,
[03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:05.720]   deliberate heat exposure, exercise protocols, and much more.
[03:08:05.720 --> 03:08:08.200]   To sign up, simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[03:08:08.200 --> 03:08:10.720]   go to the menu tab, scroll down to newsletter,

[03:08:12.040 --> 03:08:12.900]   And I want to point out
[03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:14.960]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:17.580]   And again, the newsletter is completely zero cost.
[03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:19.000]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:22.600]   for today's Journal Club discussion with Dr. Peter Attia.
[03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:24.880]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:26.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:29.380]   (upbeat music)
[03:08:29.380 --> 03:08:31.960]   (upbeat music)
