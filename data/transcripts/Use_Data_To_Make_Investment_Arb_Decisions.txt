[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.760]   And in this episode, I want to talk about using data to conduct investment arbitrage
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.440]   to make money.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.560]   Back in June 2019, I came up with this thing called the FS 20 indicator.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.840]   It was a property leading indicator that gives buyers the confidence to buy real estate.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.160]   Now what is the FS 20 property indicator?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.120]   Well FS stands for Financial Samurai, of course, and 20 stands for 20%.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.120]   So the FS 20 property indicator goes off.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.160]   It signals a buy when a home's final sales price is at least 20% higher than the online
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.880]   estimate in the neighborhood you want to buy.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.840]   So for example, if Redfin or Zillow says this house is worth a million dollars, right, that's
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.960]   their Zestimate or Redfin estimate, and it goes pending, and then three weeks later,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.840]   it sells for 1.2 million or higher, as a potential buyer on the sidelines, you look at that result
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.600]   and think, "Hmm, that is some interesting stuff," because the online estimates were
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.240]   so off.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.880]   And when you have a final sales price that is 20% or greater than the estimate, that
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.200]   is signifying that the market is moving ahead.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.640]   It's moving up.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.780]   And therefore, if you can find comps in that neighborhood, where you can buy below that
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.400]   final sales price, or actually at the Zestimate or Redfin estimate, which is much lower, right,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.840]   then you're probably good to go and you're probably going to get a good deal.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.560]   Now of course, not one sale does a trend make.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.840]   So you as the potential buyer need to continuously, you know, tag all the homes that you like.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   Hopefully you go visit them all as well.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.640]   And you keep a checklist to say, "Okay, what was the Zestimate or the Redfin estimate?
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.360]   What did it finally sell for?"
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.240]   And you plot some trends.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.040]   And so this is what I came up with in 2019.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.160]   You can go check out the post yourself and it's linked in the podcast FS20 Property Indicator.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.980]   And what has happened since then is that things have gone up, right?
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.680]   It's been pretty spot on if you were following this trend, because real estate has done very
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.640]   well since 2019, especially in 2020 and 2021.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.080]   Okay, so it's easy to say, "Yeah, things have done well."
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.680]   But again, you got to reverse back time, go back to 2019 and just think about how we were
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.680]   feeling.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.440]   You know, 2019, things were pretty good, but things were feeling pretty frothy as well.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.880]   So don't do revisionist history and think, "Oh, well, I knew 2019 was the time to buy
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.560]   because look at prices now."
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.700]   Instead, got to look at the data.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.560]   And at least here on Financial Samurai, all these posts are published with the dates and
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.920]   you can see the comments.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.960]   So there's really no going back.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.400]   I can't hide from anything, even if I wanted to.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.300]   So use these online estimates in your favor to try to get better deals.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.400]   There's always a deal out there, especially in real estate.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.320]   And there's always a deal out there, especially in the stock market too.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.120]   The markets are inefficient and things are changing all the time, which is why there's
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   always opportunity.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.520]   Now, just speaking of Redfin and Zillow, just heads up, as of October 21st, I noticed over
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.880]   the past 30 days that there's been a huge revaluation in their online estimates of real
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   estate.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.640]   And we're talking, at least here in San Francisco, like a 10% plus increase.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.480]   So they suddenly changed their estimates again so they don't look so far off.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.400]   And I talked about this in the past regarding how you can use their poor estimates in your
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.520]   favor.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.000]   So with regards to using data, data is your friend if you can use it appropriately.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.100]   And what I realized very recently is that there's other data that stock investors can
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.440]   use and real estate investors to make more informed investments.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.480]   And that is the Yelp quarterly economic average report.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.400]   They come out with these reports every three months, and they talk about what they're seeing
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.720]   in terms of small businesses, what's opening, what's closing, how does this year compare
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.240]   to this time last year, specific segments, and so forth.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.360]   Now recently my wife and I finally went out on a social gathering to see other preschool
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   parents.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.120]   It was like the first time in probably 18 months together seeing other people.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.440]   We had some drinks outside, and it was really interesting.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.400]   And while at this gathering, I realized I was a little bit self-conscious because I
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.120]   hadn't gotten a professional haircut in 18 months.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.040]   I've just been using my clippers, so I wore a hat.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.720]   And then I realized, wow, everybody's dressed so nicely.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   Whereas I've been dressing in track pants and t-shirt and just like a jacket for actually
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   forever.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   Well, since 2012, since I left finance.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.840]   And so that also made me think, "Hmm, I should probably get some new clothes."
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.140]   And so I did decide to get new clothes, a couple of shirts and a sweater to upgrade
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.760]   my 10-year-old ratty t-shirts.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   And they felt a little bit snug.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.360]   And I thought, "Hmm, I better get back in shape or at least stay in shape so I can keep
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.400]   these clothes for a very long time."
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.560]   You know, what a shame to buy your favorite jeans and then you put on 20 pounds and you
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.920]   can't fit in them comfortably anymore.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.400]   Anyway, so all of this led to my thesis that, "Hey, maybe buying health and fitness stocks
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   is a good idea."
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.640]   And you can check out the post for more details on why I like this one fitness company called
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.880]   Lifetime Fitness, Lifetime Group LTH.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.120]   It's not investment advice, but just check out my rationale because I used to think about
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.960]   this and write these kinds of reports while I worked in finance for 13 years.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.040]   So going back to using data to make investment arbitrage decisions or better investment decisions,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.320]   while I took a look at the Q3 2021 Economic Average Report, and in the report, it said,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.160]   "After a year of home and outdoor workouts growing in popularity, gym and fitness classes
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.040]   are back on the rise."
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:06.320]   In Q3 2021, Pilates is up 54%, pole dancing classes up 56%, aerial fitness, that sounds
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.480]   really fun, up 74%, yoga 41%, bar classes 42%, saunas, saunas, right?
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.940]   That's a small room, up 55%.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.740]   And they have all surpassed Q3 2020 consumer interest levels.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.480]   So that is bullish data.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.440]   So how do you turn that bullish data into action?
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.720]   Well, I was looking at Lifetime Fitness, and they just went public on October 7, 2021.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   And so when you go public, there's this thing called the blackout period or the quiet period.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.680]   For 40 days after listing, management cannot say a word.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.040]   They can't say things are going great, things are going poorly, they can't tell their friends,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.660]   they got to be quiet to follow SEC guidelines.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.240]   This is so there's no unfair advantage for anybody to trade the stock.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.760]   So here's the thing, folks, the Yelp 3Q 2021 economic average report talks about stuff
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.560]   that ended on September 30, the calendar year, that's the end of the third quarter.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.600]   Now given LTH went public on October 7, management cannot say anything for 40 days after.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.860]   So in other words, they can't say anything until mid November 2021.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.800]   So as an investor, you've got to think about the future, you've got to always try to connect
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.960]   the dots and predict the future.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.480]   Now based on the Yelp 3Q 2021 report, things are booming in the fitness and gym space.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.360]   And LTH is in the fitness and gym space.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.680]   It has more like a luxury resort fitness and gyms with 150,000 square feet and indoor space
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.180]   and stuff like that.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.960]   But it is my opinion that management has seen those strong third quarter results, but it
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.980]   just can't say anything because it's in the quiet period.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.360]   It would violate SEC law.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:01.160]   Therefore, management of LTH and perhaps other fitness companies that operate gyms are just
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.320]   biting their lips, bursting to say something positive, but they cannot because they don't
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.120]   want to go to jail or get fined.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:14.280]   But as retail investors, we can do what we want based on our analytical minds and how
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.840]   we connect those dots.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.560]   So for me, I'm going to be buying some health and fitness stocks.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.040]   I think it's one of the last reopening trades.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   You've seen airline stocks come back from 2020 lows, hotel stocks.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.040]   Some of them are doing really well.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.560]   Like Hilton is doing really well.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.940]   Airbnb is up like 8x since Silverlake bailed them out in mid 2020.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.840]   And then a lot of the hospitality, private real estate deals that I follow, that I invest
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.440]   in are doing well.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.720]   The demand is there, right?
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.060]   It's going to take years to play out to see how well they do, especially for those ones
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.560]   that you invest in in last year or this year 2021.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.140]   But the demand is there.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.200]   So you've got to think what's next.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.560]   For me, you know, the S&P 500 is at $4,500.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.240]   I think it's probably going to continue going higher because the earnings trend is your
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   friend.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.400]   But instead of chasing momentum all the time or just buying at all-time highs, which is
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.320]   generally played out and done well, you also want to look at some contrarian names that
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.240]   have lagged and that could do well once the hype starts.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.520]   So in my opinion, when we all start to think about our weight and our health at the end
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.640]   of the year and what are the two largest, most popular New Year's resolutions every
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.400]   single year, that's get richer.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.360]   And the bull market has helped us do that.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.020]   Listening to this podcast and reading personal finance sites like Financial Samurai hopefully
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.820]   have helped you do that.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.080]   But the one thing that has lagged is our fitness because we're all stuck at home or a lot of
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   us are.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.120]   The average weight gain is 29 pounds and the average man is 200 pounds and the average
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.760]   woman is like 166 pounds.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.680]   I mean, that's a lot, folks.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.200]   So we got the money.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.640]   Well, at least investors have more money now.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.940]   But if we don't have commensurate health improvements, I don't know whether all that money will really
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.140]   matter if we start feeling sick.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.000]   So that's my thesis, folks.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.440]   Use online data.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.800]   It's out there.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.320]   Pay attention.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.560]   Track those data points because sometimes they come true and they give you some insights
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.640]   into what actions you can take to make more money.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.440]   Now, of course, none of us know the future.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   Right.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.080]   So my investment in health and fitness could clearly backfire.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.840]   Maybe COVID comes back again and people go back into their homes.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   Who knows?
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840]   But that's investing.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.840]   There's never a guarantee.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.320]   If you want to guarantee you just keep cash under your mattress or you buy CDs up to $250,000
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.400]   per person and then that's guaranteed.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.000]   But if you want to be an investor, you've got to look forward.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.380]   You've got to connect the dots and see what's out there.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.380]   So that's my thoughts.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.560]   If you have any negative viewpoints about the health and fitness center, why it's not
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.080]   going to come back and any other kind of reopening trades, I'd love to know.
