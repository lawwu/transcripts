[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   I suppose we had to address this at some point, and today is the day that we talk
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.640]   about preaching gestures. Behind the pulpit, Pastor John, you'll hop, you
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.960]   twist, you point, you chop, and I think for every Greek preposition there's at least
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.840]   one trademark Piper gesture. Have you always used gestures? Where did they come
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.400]   from, and what role did those gestures play in your preaching? I think I better
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.220]   preface anything I say about my gestures by pointing out that my hero, Jonathan
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.960]   Edwards, in the two or three contemporaneous descriptions of his
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.720]   preaching was known for being amazingly still. Edwards scarcely gestured. At
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.120]   one point in his ministry he would put his elbow on a cushion, hold his notes in
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.000]   his right hand, and read them. Same thing with Thomas Chalmers, who had
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.760]   such a great effect in Scotland. One of the Princetonians, and I
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.960]   forget who it was, Alexander maybe, went to Scotland and listened to Chalmers, and
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.720]   when he came back they said, "Now what is the key to Chalmers' effectiveness in
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.320]   preaching?" And he said, "His blood earnestness." In other words, Chalmers read his
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.080]   manuscripts, and if you're reading your manuscripts you don't have a lot of
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.240]   freedom to move around or do very much. So it is possible to leap and wave and
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.400]   holler and entertain and say nothing, and entertain people and be
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.640]   useless. And I don't want to do that, and therefore gestures in my mind are not
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.280]   of the essence of the demonstration of the Spirit and power. That's just not
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.520]   what they are, because you know that, because people can listen to
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.120]   sheer audio of messages and have their lives changed. They can't see you
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.760]   at all when that's happening. So with regard to me, I just have almost
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.960]   nothing to say about this, because I don't think about it. I have never planned
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.680]   a gesture. I never stand in front of a mirror and try to figure out what
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.080]   would be an effective move here. I just never, ever do that. And when I'm
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.240]   preaching, to the degree that I'm aware, I'm in trouble, because then it's
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.120]   artificial, then it feels really phony to me. "Well, what would be the next best move
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   to do here?" If I'm watching myself preach, I'm lost. Self-consciousness is the
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.880]   curse of the preacher. It's horrible to think, "What am I going to say next?
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.160]   What am I going to move next?" And to be outside yourself, watching yourself
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.360]   preach, is just a curse. And therefore, whatever I do in the pulpit just comes
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.600]   naturally. And I've never studied gesture. I've never planned gesture. I
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.000]   don't think about gesture while I'm preaching. And I had a woman say to me
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.120]   one time, Hazel, she's still there at Bethlehem, one of our older Saints. It's
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.240]   back on the left. Actually, she doesn't come anymore, because she's not quite
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.600]   able to get out. But until last year or so, she came, and she took my arm one time,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.440]   like older people do, drew me in close, and she said, "Pastor John, I just love to
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.920]   watch you preach. I understand you because of your hands." That's what she
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.000]   said. "I understand you because of your hands." Now, that was a compliment to me,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   because in my mind, what my body is doing is twofold. It is simply spontaneously
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.440]   trying to clarify. I'm doing it right now, believe it or not. I'm trying to clarify
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.120]   what I'm saying, and this is why I'm doing it right now. It's just part of the
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.440]   energy, right? It's part of the expressiveness. It's the soul becoming
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.680]   visible and not just hearable, and that's what you want. You want the
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.000]   significance of what you're saying to be seen and felt, and I suppose it's a
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.360]   largely personality thing as to how much expressiveness you give with your voice
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.560]   and how much expressiveness you give with your body. But for me, it's just
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   who I am and what I do, and it's part of the language. I don't think
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.880]   we have a video of you preaching circa 1980 in the early days, but do you
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.840]   suspect that you would have used the same gestures 30 years ago, or were you
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.720]   more reserved? I think I'm less reserved and probably more expressive. You'd have
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.360]   to ask some people that have been around a long time. I know Char, she's still
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.640]   around. You can ask Char. Char said she liked the early John Piper better,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.160]   but when she said that years ago, she said, "He didn't shout so much." I don't
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.240]   know whether she would say about the gesturing as much either, but my guess is
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.520]   all of us, as we become relaxed with the people we're with, as you have more
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.320]   family, you know, feeling for your people, and you're just more at ease with your
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.520]   manuscript or your notes, you loosen up and you become more who you are. And so I
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:37.640]   would say I haven't become more, I hope, artificially emotive, but rather I've
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.440]   just become more me, because I'm less intimidated by the situation. Thank you,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.400]   Pastor John. Please email your preaching questions to us at
