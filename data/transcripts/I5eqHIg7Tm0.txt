[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.220]   All right, you guys are in for a treat
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.560]   because you get Mike Piper back up here.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.360]   If we can tear him away from the drinks there in the back,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.680]   he's back there serving drinks.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.760]   But let's get him back up here.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.240]   He's gonna talk about investing in a simple manner.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.680]   And the best thing about this with Mike
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.880]   is that he practiced what he preaches.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.080]   And the thing I love about Mike
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.560]   is I am still learning stuff from Mike.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.000]   I sent him an email just last week
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.080]   to clarify something I did not understand.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.720]   He sent me back an email filled with algebra.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.420]   He totally understood it.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.880]   And so it's great to have Mike as a resource.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Luckily, he's not gonna be talking about algebra,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.140]   I hope, in this presentation,
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.040]   but it should still be well worth your time and attention.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.480]   - All right, invest with simplicity.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.840]   Back in 2008, or Alan can correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.840]   in 2009 perhaps,
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.800]   in his book How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.440]   he outlined what he called the second grader portfolio.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.940]   And this was a portfolio that consists
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.120]   of a total stock market index fund,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.380]   a total international stock index fund,
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.320]   and a total bond market index fund.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.720]   And you keep hearing about this portfolio.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.360]   Now we just call it the three fund portfolio,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   and it's become largely a default investment recommendation
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.900]   among the Vogelheads community.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.200]   And the reason it's become so popular
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.240]   is because it's really simple,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.820]   and it's extremely well diversified.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120]   Just like Alan and Christine were showing you,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.080]   it includes thousands of stocks from around the world
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.240]   and a diversified collection of bonds
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.680]   with just three mutual funds.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.080]   And in some cases, for some people,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.760]   it can make sense to go one step simpler.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.840]   You can use a one fund portfolio.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.440]   That would include something like a target date fund,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.320]   a Vanguard life strategy fund, that's what I use,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.720]   or a balanced fund.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.000]   A lot of fund companies offer those.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.960]   They're very straightforward.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.800]   They typically just have a fixed 60% stock,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.000]   40% bond allocation.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.520]   But if you're considering using a one fund portfolio,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.160]   it's important to keep a lot of different things in mind
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.920]   before making that decision.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   Number one is that it's still important
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.360]   that the fund has a low expense ratio.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.120]   That matters with these funds just as much
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.760]   as with any other mutual fund.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.640]   High expenses are going to eat into your returns.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.740]   Number two, it's really important to take some time
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.000]   to check the actual asset allocation for the fund,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.880]   as well as the glide path,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.080]   which is how the allocation is supposed to change over time.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.280]   Look into that, rather than just relying
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.820]   on the name of the fund.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.840]   For example, if your 401(k) has a 2040 target date fund
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.100]   and you're planning to retire in 2040,
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.200]   that fund might not be a good fit for you.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080]   Your personal risk tolerance could be much higher
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.440]   or much lower than whatever this fund company assumes
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.520]   is typical for somebody retiring in that year,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.960]   because there's more to risk tolerance
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.040]   than just what year you plan to retire.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.320]   So it's important to just look it up
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.960]   on the fund company website or Morningstar or wherever
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.080]   and see what the actual asset allocation is
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.320]   and see if that's a good fit for you,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.160]   because maybe, again, using the 2040 example,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.840]   maybe the 2030 fund or the 2050 fund
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.040]   is gonna be a better fit for your personal risk tolerance.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.960]   And finally, the last important thing to keep in mind
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.920]   about all-in-one funds is that they aren't a good fit
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.520]   for taxable accounts.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.160]   We were just talking about using tax-efficient funds
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.640]   in a taxable account.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.800]   All-in-one funds are not tax-efficient.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.720]   There's a few reasons for that.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.960]   Reason number one is that they use taxable bonds,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.280]   whereas for some people,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   tax-exempt municipal bonds would be a better fit.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.320]   Reason number two is they get in the way of asset location.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.360]   Remember, asset location, the whole idea,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.760]   is to make sure to only own tax-efficient things
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.680]   in your taxable accounts.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.800]   Well, with an all-in-one fund,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.440]   the whole point is to own everything,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.120]   so it's going to include some tax-inefficient stuff
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.400]   in that taxable brokerage account, which isn't ideal.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.200]   And number three is that --
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.160]   the third reason they're tax-inefficient is
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.360]   that this fund-of-funds structure,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.880]   so a target-date fund that owns underlying mutual funds,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   it adds another layer of turnover, right?
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.600]   If you imagine, for example, the Vanguard target-date funds,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.280]   they've got four underlying mutual funds,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.360]   a U.S. stock fund, international stock fund, U.S. bond fund,
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.920]   international bond fund.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.640]   And each of those four underlying funds has its own
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.480]   level of turnover, and so that creates some taxes.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.160]   But then the target-date fund
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.800]   that owns those funds has its own turnover because it has
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   to rebalance among those four underlying mutual funds,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.560]   and that creates some additional tax costs for you as well.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.760]   And sometimes you'll see a case -- not going to name names,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.680]   but a particular fund company this year switched one
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.560]   of the underlying funds in a significant way.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.040]   It created a huge capital gain distribution for shareholders.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.640]   It was really expensive.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.360]   So these, again, target-date funds, life-strategy funds,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120]   they're neat, they're great in a lot of cases,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.560]   but they're not a good fit for a taxable brokerage account.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.680]   But why do we talk about investing with simplicity at all?
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.000]   Like, why did this make it onto the list
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.880]   of Vogelhead's principles?
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.840]   Because rebalancing isn't, frankly, all that hard.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.120]   If you can use a spreadsheet, you can do it.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.360]   You can even do it with pencil and paper and a calculator if,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.400]   you know, if you're inclined to do that sort of thing.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.560]   But simpler portfolios do save you time.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.000]   They take less time to rebalance.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.840]   And if you're using an all-in-one fund,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.240]   like a target-date fund,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.480]   they completely eliminate the job.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.280]   So the example I always use is I compare it
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.600]   to doing the laundry, right?
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.560]   It's not like that's a really challenging job,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.800]   but it would be nice to never have to do it.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   That's what a target-date fund does.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.360]   It just removes this chore from your life, and that's nice.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.280]   But really, that's not the most compelling reason, in my opinion.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.560]   That's not the most compelling reason
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.440]   to use a simpler portfolio.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.800]   The better reason for a simpler portfolio is
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.400]   that it improves investor behavior.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.520]   And to talk about that, I want to highlight the study
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.600]   that has come up, Alan mentioned it also.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's Morningstar's Mind the Gap study.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.480]   And they do this study every couple of years.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.440]   And every time, they look at the last 10 years
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.280]   of mutual fund performance.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   And they look at all of the different mutual funds
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.480]   that Morningstar looks at, so however many thousands
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.200]   of funds that is.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.160]   And for each mutual fund, they look at two things.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.560]   First, they look at the regular reported performance figure
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.400]   for that fund, right?
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.000]   So that's just the 10-year return figure that you would see
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.320]   on a fund company website, or in a prospectus,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.080]   or in a brochure, or something like that.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.840]   And then the second figure
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.440]   that they calculate is what they call the investor return.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.200]   And this is a dollar-weighted figure.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.840]   So it accounts for the cash flow that's coming into the fund
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.560]   or going out of the fund when shareholders buy
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.880]   and sell shares.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.920]   And so the idea with this investor return figure is
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   to reflect the actual return
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.960]   that the average investor actually earned in this fund
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.920]   over the period in question.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.040]   So if we consider a hypothetical actively managed fund,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.560]   imagine it's brand new at the beginning
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.200]   of those 10 years, right?
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.640]   And so because it's brand new, and let's also say it's
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.720]   from a brand new fund company.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.000]   So nobody's heard of it.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.440]   It has almost no assets under management.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.840]   And imagine that for the first four years
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.680]   of the 10-year period it has excellent performance,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.840]   just incredible returns.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.480]   And so during those four years,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.840]   people start to hear about it, right?
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.720]   It gets written up in some articles and so on.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.080]   And so a bunch of money comes flooding into this mutual fund.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.080]   And then in our example here, let's imagine
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.840]   that over the last six years of the period,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.080]   it has really mediocre performance.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.000]   Well, the regular 10-year performance figure,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.560]   the 10-year return figure for this fund,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.840]   each of those 10 years is going to count the same
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.360]   as the other 10 years.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.840]   So it's going to have a pretty good 10-year return figure
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.960]   because those first four years were so good.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.360]   But the investor return figure is not going to be as good
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.920]   because those first four years,
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.320]   nobody owned the fund during those first four years.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.960]   So they won't count for very much in the calculation.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.720]   In the last six years with the mediocre returns,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.400]   that's when most people owned the fund.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.960]   So that's what will count for most of the calculation.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.920]   So in this example, you'll see a good 10-year return
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.400]   and a really mediocre 10-year investor return.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.880]   There's going to be a big gap between the two.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.960]   And that's why they call it the Mind the Gap Study
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.080]   because we're looking at that difference.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.720]   And the point is that that gap is a measure
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.320]   of how well investors do with the timing of their buying
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.760]   and selling of the fund.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.600]   So in our example here, this hypothetical fund,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.760]   this big gap is the result of the fact
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.840]   that investors did a terrible job
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.320]   with the timing of their purchases, right?
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.840]   They bought after the first four good years
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.000]   and right before the six mediocre years.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.120]   So there's a big gap.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.800]   Now, where I'm going with all of this,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.080]   if we look at the most recent edition of the study,
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.880]   so it came out this year and it looked
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.800]   at the 10 years ending December 31st of last year,
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.960]   these are the gaps for the different categories of funds.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.000]   And the two things I want to highlight here are
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   that the gap was smallest for allocation funds.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.400]   That's basically things -- so that's Morningstar's term.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.280]   It's basically things that include stocks and bonds
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.040]   within the same mutual fund.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.720]   So balance funds, target date funds, life strategy funds.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.960]   And the gap was largest for sector equity funds.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.480]   That would be things like a technology stock fund
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.000]   or a healthcare stock fund.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.120]   And because they do this study every couple of years,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.480]   of course, the exact figures,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.440]   the exact percentages change, right, from one edition
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.920]   of the study to the other.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.520]   But this overall relationship is very consistent.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.880]   Every time we see that investors do well with allocation funds.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.360]   And to me, that's not the slightest bit surprising.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.080]   Because if you think about a target date fund,
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.200]   imagine you're using that in your 401(k).
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.480]   All it is is one fund.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.320]   You just put money into the same fund.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.880]   There's no temptation to move your money around, right?
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.080]   The whole point is to put it on autopilot.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.360]   And so a lot of people do that.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.280]   They put it on autopilot.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.680]   And that actually works really well.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.040]   And then the other thing we see every time
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.560]   is that investors do really poorly
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.640]   with sector equity funds.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.840]   And again, to me, that's not surprising.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.280]   Because when you see portfolios
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.440]   that include sector equity funds,
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   they're usually portfolios that have like 30 mutual funds
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.640]   or something insane.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.720]   And so when that's what your portfolio looks like,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.440]   there's a huge temptation to move your money
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.000]   a little bit this way or a little bit that way
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.840]   or get rid of this fund and add that fund.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.160]   And that's not to say that you personally would do that.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.680]   But there is very clear,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.080]   this data from Morningstar makes it very clear
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.760]   that investors do that.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.320]   And it's generally to their detriment.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.000]   And they do it more often
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.320]   with funds that represent narrow slices of the market
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.800]   than they do with more broadly diversified funds.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   And that's true all the way up
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.040]   to the most broadly diversified allocation funds
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.440]   where investors do the best.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.800]   So the study also drills down
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.880]   into narrower categories of funds.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.280]   And here we're looking at the gap
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.480]   for large cap stock funds,
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.360]   meaning funds that invest in stocks of large companies.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.840]   And the gap for large blend funds,
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.400]   large blend meaning that the fund
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.840]   is not specifically a growth fund,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.760]   nor specifically a value fund.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.240]   So it invests in growth stocks and value stocks.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.280]   The gap for large blend funds was about,
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.000]   or exactly three quarters of a percent per year.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.560]   The gap for large growth funds was about 1.3% per year.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.360]   And the gap for large value funds was about 1.3% also.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.200]   It's one of those cases where your intuition could trick you
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.560]   because you might expect that large blend
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.200]   is basically a blend of large growth and large value, right?
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.320]   So you might imagine that the gap for large blend
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.120]   would be between the gap for large growth
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.040]   and the gap for large value, and it's not.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.720]   It's smaller than either of those other two gaps.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.760]   You've got investors doing better
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.120]   with the more broadly diversified funds
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.400]   than with the less diversified funds.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.080]   So why invest with simplicity?
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.320]   It does save you time.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.720]   And that is, frankly, that's nice, I appreciate it,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.760]   but that's not the biggest benefit.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.440]   The biggest benefit is just that it makes it easier
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.160]   to stick with your plan.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.600]   And this is a quote from the conclusion
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.440]   of the most recent version of the study.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.280]   The authors wrote, this is their italics, by the way,
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.240]   they recommended that the reader focus on holding
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.600]   a small number of widely diversified funds.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.120]   They went on to say that as the fund industry has grown,
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.880]   asset management firms have rolled out
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.200]   more and more highly specialized funds,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.000]   but investors have fared far better by keeping things simple
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.200]   and sticking with plain vanilla, broadly diversified funds.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.440]   And then they went on to write that funds
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.560]   that offer built-in asset class diversification,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.360]   so that's funds that include stocks and bonds
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.440]   in the same fund, so target date funds,
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.560]   life strategy funds, balance funds.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.840]   They also excelled in the study.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.960]   Not only are these funds easy to use,
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.720]   but they're also easy to live with.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.280]   Investors tend to buy and hold them for long periods,
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.000]   or make investments on a regular schedule,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.800]   like in a 401k.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   And that enforces investment discipline,
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.480]   and helps them avoid the temptations and pitfalls
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.680]   of trading at the wrong time.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.320]   So that's it for invest with simplicity.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.880]   Got Jim coming up in a minute.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.040]   (audience applauding)
