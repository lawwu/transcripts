[00:00:43.360 --> 00:01:00.400]   [Music]
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.320]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, Monday, July 21, 2014. Thank you for
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.280]   being here. And today's show is going to be a bit of a variety show. Instead of my talking on for
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600]   an hour about one topic, we're going to try to cover about 10. Probably in about an hour, but
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.000]   we'll see. I don't, I'm not known for being able to do hour-long shows. I hope you'll enjoy us today
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.520]   and stay with us. [Music]
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   So with it being a beautiful new Monday today, I've got a listing of all of some of the articles
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.440]   that I have found over the past week. And as I've mentioned before, what I hope to do with the show
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.200]   is really bring a variety. And so in my mind, although I do enjoy in-depth financial planning
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.080]   topics, man, I can't handle that stuff every day. I would go nuts if I had to talk about tax planning
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.320]   and what was the one show I did last week on balance sheets, statements of financial condition.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.520]   I would go nuts if I had to talk about that all day long. I don't enjoy it that much. I mean,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.080]   I like it, but one or two days a week is great. And interviewing people is awesome, but I tell
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.640]   you it takes a lot of time to prepare for an interview to do it well. And so, and answering
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.800]   questions is great, but I don't want to do that every day. So in my mind, what I think would work
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.280]   really well for this show is what the routine that I'd like to get into is Mondays kind of do a
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.080]   variety show with various articles that are in the news, current commentary on news events,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.360]   economic events, economic goings on, things like that. Tuesdays, you know, something like Tuesday,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.000]   Wednesday, and Thursday do a couple of interviews, one or two interviews with somebody. And then the
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   other day do an in-depth financial planning educational show. And then Fridays do listener Q&A.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.640]   So that's kind of the, that's the plan that's in my head. So Monday today, we're going to talk
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.400]   about a number of interesting, interesting topics. And some, basically this is from some of my
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.920]   reading from the last week, some of the different articles that caught my eye and some of the
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.480]   different topics that I am interested in researching a little bit. We're going to lead off by talking
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.400]   about happiness. And as maybe you've picked up by now, I personally think that we should spend a
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.280]   lot more time focusing on things like happiness and contentment than just simply on the dollar
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.880]   figures. But yet dollar figures have a, an impact on happiness, clearly. So how do these work
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   together? Well, let's start with a, a article here from Market Watch, and this is from July 18,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.280]   2014. All of the articles will be linked in the show notes. Feel free to check through.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.560]   So headline is from Market Watch. New York City is the most unhappy city in America.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.200]   And all you New Yorkers might be a little bit upset with me right now, but let's read it.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Cheer up, Big Apple residents. New York City is the most unhappy city in America.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.600]   That's according to data coming from a working paper by Harvard professor, Edward Glazer,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.960]   Vancouver School of Economics professor, Joshua Gottlieb, and Harvard doctoral student,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.600]   Oren Ziv. They use data collected in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey called the
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.360]   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and then adjusted it for age, sex, race, income,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.160]   and other factors. Such adjustments are important. Women, for instance, are happier than men. The
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.400]   married are happier than single or divorced respondents, and so on. By the way, don't rush
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.440]   past that. Women are happier than men. Married people are happier than single or divorced people.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.000]   And there's good evidence for that as well. So as to why, we'll talk about that in a minute.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.480]   In short, New Yorkers are unhappiest on an adjusted basis. But scoff at those adjustments
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.280]   as you like. They are still third most unhappy region of the areas where there are at least 200
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.000]   respondents out of 177 metro areas on an unadjusted basis. It'd be blithe to say those
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.720]   who work on Wall Street are scientifically miserable. But remember, money buys happiness,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.040]   so probably not. The happiest five cities are all in Louisiana, with Lafayette taking the crown.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.840]   Louisiana is also the happiest state. The unhappiest cities after New York City are St.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.880]   Joseph, Missouri; South Bend, Indiana; Erie, Pennsylvania; and the Evansville, Indiana;
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.400]   Henderson, Kentucky area. So I thought this was an interesting article. And I personally would
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.440]   not have any interest in living in New York City. I can see why people might be unhappy there,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.400]   but I think it's a fun place to visit. But hey, I say go for it. So I went and found the actual
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.880]   study. And the actual study is more interesting than the news article. It's a nice sensationalist
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.760]   article for Market Watch to post three paragraphs on. But the study was actually
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.600]   extremely interesting. And so you'll find it linked in the show notes. It's right available
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.720]   as a PDF on the Harvard.edu website. And I'm going to read from the abstract up front,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.600]   and then also from the conclusion. So this is only a 30-page study plus appendices. And so it's
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.560]   entitled Unhappy Cities in the Abstract. There are persistent differences in self-reported
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.720]   subjective well-being across the United States. And in particular, the residents of declining
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.400]   cities report less happiness than other Americans. Although this unhappiness is at least as strong
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.600]   among new residents of such places as long-term residents, some people continue to move to these
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.040]   areas. These areas also seem to have been less happy historically during the era in which these
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.320]   now declining cities prospered. These patterns are compatible with the view that individuals do
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.560]   not aim to maximize self-reported well-being or happiness, and that subjective well-being is better
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.320]   viewed as only one part of the utility function. In the past, the residents of now declining places
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.760]   were compensated financially for their unhappiness. But it is less clear what draws migrants to these
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.920]   unhappy places today. So when I read this through this study, and again, it's pretty short, it's
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.000]   only about 30 pages, pretty easy to read, although it does put a bunch of interesting equations in
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.160]   here to prove their point with the statistics of the adjustments that they made. But when I read
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.480]   this, it was very interesting to just kind of look through the thinking of it, and to see some of the
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.720]   differences in thinking and some of the different theories that these psychology researchers have
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   as far as what may be responsible for these effects. And I'll read the conclusion here,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.760]   but in general, the conclusion of the paper was that we don't quite know. And I'm fascinated by
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.240]   happiness literature, by some of the books that have been written. I think to me, this is a far
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.200]   more important goal that should be right at the top of our financial planning goals and agenda,
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.720]   beyond just maximizing financial or material wealth. It should be maximizing happiness.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:34.000]   And some of the strategies that we employ to reach that point may include financial wealth,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.440]   and some of them may not. But it just seems like a far more rational strategy. So they go through
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.680]   and give some of the different ideas about the attributes, whether it's income level.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.600]   But one thing that they do point out in here that I think was the most interesting to me
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:58.000]   is talking about how we generally are going to be compensated for a lower happiness factor.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.200]   So they report that in New York City, as would be intuitive, that in New York City,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.840]   the wages are higher, but the level of happiness is down. And so one of the hypotheses that they
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.360]   explore is, is it true that people have to be compensated for their happiness, for their
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.840]   diminished happiness? And I think this, to me, this strikes me as intuitively true,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.720]   that if you're going to do a job that is miserable, you might as well get paid a lot for it.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.640]   And you wouldn't be willing if you had two jobs, one was miserable and one was happy,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.160]   and they offer the same market price, then it would be very important. I would just assume
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.400]   most people would go with a job that would make them happy. So where is that trade-off, however?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.880]   How much unhappiness are you willing to take for the additional wages? Or how much additional wage
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.760]   do you demand for the unhappiness that you're going to experience? So I encourage you to read
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.720]   the, check out the study, I think you'd enjoy it. Let me just read the conclusion here,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.800]   because I think this conclusion is also valuable. "In this paper, we have documented significant
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.080]   differences in self-reported well-being across American cities that persist, even when we
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.240]   control for endogenous and exogenous demographics." So endogenous coming from within,
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.680]   exogenous coming from without, without the system. "And even when we control for individual fixed
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.960]   effects, these facts are not reliably correlated with many area-level attributes, but they do seem
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.800]   to be connected with urban decline across at least three large data sets. We do not interpret this
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   correlation as a suggestion that population decline causes unhappiness. Indeed, cities that
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.280]   have declined also seem to have been unhappy in the past, which suggests that a better interpretation
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.080]   might be these areas were always unhappy, and that was one reason why they declined.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.920]   Differences in happiness and subjective well-being across space weakly support the view that the
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.240]   desire for happiness and life satisfaction do not uniquely drive human ambitions. If we choose only
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.920]   that which maximizes our happiness, then individuals would presumably move to happier places
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.400]   until the point where rising rents and congestion eliminated the joys of that locale. An alternative
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.720]   view is that humans are quite understandably willing to sacrifice both happiness and life
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:21.440]   satisfaction if the price is right. This viewpoint rationalizes the well-known tendency of parents to
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.960]   report lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction." And inserting a point there,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.200]   they talk about that earlier in the study, that evidently young parents of young children and
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.480]   parents report lower satisfaction and happiness than do married people without children. However,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.480]   that seems to be offset by the advantages of having progeny, being able to continue your
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.000]   lineage, and some of the other advantages. I don't buy that from me, but I do understand how that
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.800]   could be true across the board. I really enjoy my son and being a parent. I think it's one of the
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.440]   most fulfilling things that I can do, but not everyone has to agree with me. Continuing on,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.200]   "This viewpoint rationalizes the well-known tendency of parents to report lower levels
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.120]   of happiness and life satisfaction. Indeed, the residents of unhappier metropolitan areas today
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   do receive higher wages, presumably as compensation for their misery. Declining
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.160]   cities seem also to have been unhappy during the past, but in 1940, the cities that did decline
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.520]   earned outsized incomes and paid little in higher rents. The industrial cities of the Midwest may
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.480]   have reported lower happiness levels, but their residents were getting richer as a result.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.880]   As transportation technology freed industry from the Great Lakes and the coal mines, we should not
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.400]   be surprised that people left less pleasant locations, but there remains a puzzle. Today,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.480]   the residents of cities that declined are not receiving higher wages, and they do not seem to
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.920]   be paying lower rents either. We leave the quest of understanding how this constitutes an equilibrium
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.440]   to future work." So the takeaway that I would take away, and that I would encourage you to consider,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.840]   and I try to apply all these articles to, what can I as an individual do? Consider your personal
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.440]   happiness scale. I don't know necessarily how to measure that, but consider your personal
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.560]   happiness scale and consider, are you being compensated for any misery that you're choosing
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.960]   to go under? And so whether that's misery at a low state, so a long commute, whether that's misery at
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.920]   a more intense state, a very stressful job, but just ask yourself, are you being compensated for
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:34.400]   it? And figure out if you're being compensated on it. And you can always adjust. So don't worry
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.640]   about the population in general adjusting. If you live in a miserable city and you have a miserable
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:46.800]   job, change it. Like my little joke that I always understand is if you're a bum in Chicago or New
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.840]   York or one of these places where it's cold, why would you not go be a bum in Hawaii? Why would you
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.520]   not go be a bum in Florida? Even if you've got to walk there or hitchhike there or something,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.640]   at least go where you're not cold every day. So we can all do the same thing. We can all do the
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.160]   same thing with ourselves. So this led me, this article led me to an interesting, I wanted to
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.560]   explore some of the other research that Harvard has done on happiness, and I came across something
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   I had never read about, which was the Grant Study, which according to now my research is one of the
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:23.280]   longest running longitudinal studies of human development. The project began in 1938 and it
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.160]   has followed 268 Harvard undergraduate men for 75 years, measuring an astonishing range of
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.240]   psychological, anthropological, and physical traits, from personality type to IQ, drinking
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.120]   habits, family relationships to physical characteristics, in an effort to determine
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.720]   what factors contribute most strongly to human flourishing. And so there's this interesting study
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.800]   that I found, I actually discovered that in this study, John F. Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:14:00.240]   was actually part of this original base of people that were being researched. And so a man named
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:07.120]   George Valand, as a Harvard psychiatrist, he directed the study from 1974 to 2004, and he's
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.840]   written various books about it. I'm going to read from one article here about some of the overview
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   of his output, of his results, but I've added a couple of his books to my reading list. One of
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.040]   them is called Aging Well, Surprising Guideposts to a Happier Life from the Landmark Study of Adult
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.320]   Development. And the other one is actually I'm probably most interested in, it's called, well
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.640]   these are both well, these are both interesting. The other one is called Triumphs of Experience,
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.120]   the Men of the Harvard Grant Study. And there's some takeaways that I'm going to read from the
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:46.480]   synopsis of those books in just a moment. But here's a summary of the five outputs that George
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.080]   Valand talked about, five lessons from the Grant Study, and I'll read this from a Huffington Post
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.640]   article. So below, five lessons from the Grant Study to apply to your own pursuit of a happier
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.040]   and more meaningful life. Love is really all that matters. It may seem obvious, but that doesn't
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.960]   make it any less true. Love is key to a happy and fulfilling life. As Valand puts it, there are two
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.640]   pillars of happiness. "One is love," he writes, "the other is finding a way of coping with life
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.200]   that does not push love away." Valand has said the study's most important finding is that the only
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.720]   thing that matters in life is relationships. A man could have a successful career, money, and good
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.680]   physical health, but without supportive, loving relationships, he wouldn't be happy.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:39.440]   Happiness is only the cart. Love is the horse. It's about more than money and power. The Grant
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.800]   Study's findings echoed those of other studies, that acquiring more money and power doesn't
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.720]   correlate to greater happiness. That's not to say money or traditional career success don't matter,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.600]   but they're small parts of a much larger picture. And while they may loom large for us in the
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.920]   moment, they diminish in importance when viewed in the context of a full life. "We found that
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.840]   contentment in the late '70s was not even suggestively associated with parental social class
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.720]   or even the man's own income," says Valand. "In terms of achievement, the only thing that matters
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:19.440]   is that you be content at your work." Regardless of how we begin life, we can all become happier.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.800]   A man named Godfrey Minot-Camille went into the Grant Study with fairly bleak prospects for life
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.760]   satisfaction. He had the lowest rating for future stability of all the subjects, and he had
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.360]   previously attempted suicide. But at the end of his life, he was one of the happiest. Why?
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:43.920]   As Valand explains, "He spent his life searching for love." Connection is crucial. "Joy is
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.560]   connection," Valand says. "The more areas in your life you can make connection, the better."
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.000]   The study found strong relationships to be far and away the strongest predictor of life satisfaction.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.960]   And in terms of career satisfaction, too, feeling connected to one's work was far more important
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   than making money or achieving traditional success. "The conclusion of the study, not in a medical but
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.360]   in a psychological sense, is that connection is the whole shooting match," says Valand.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.640]   As life goes on, connections become even more important. The Grant Study provides strong
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.000]   support for the growing body of research that has linked social ties with longevity,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   lower stress levels, and improved overall well-being. Challenges and the perspective
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.080]   they give you can make you happier. "The journey from immaturity to maturity," says Valand,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.120]   "is a sort of movement from narcissism to connection. And a big part of this shift has
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:43.520]   to do with the way we deal with challenges." Coping mechanisms, the capacity to make gold
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.960]   out of junk, as Valand puts it, have a significant effect on social support and overall well-being.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.000]   The secret is replacing narcissism, a single-minded focus on one's own emotional
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.120]   oscillations and perceived problems, with mature coping defenses, Valand explains,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.960]   citing Mother Teresa and Beethoven as examples. "Mother Teresa had a perfectly terrible childhood,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.920]   and her inner spiritual life was very painful," says Valand, "but she had a highly successful
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.200]   life by caring about other people." Creative expression is another way to productively deal
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.320]   with challenges and achieve meaning and well-being. "The secret of Beethoven being able to cope with
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.160]   misery through his art was when he wrote Ode to Joy," says Valand. "Beethoven was able to make
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.000]   connection with his music." So I find that really interesting, a really interesting article, and
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.720]   just simply connecting that ultimately love and connections are incredibly important,
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.440]   incredibly important. And this is one of the things that I observe in my own life as a constant
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.760]   challenge and then in other people's lives as well, is there is a need for prioritizing
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.320]   financial achievement, there is a need to prioritizing financial steps, but if you do it
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.080]   to the exclusion of love, connections, relationships, and doing work that matters, it's very
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.280]   likely that it may not make you happy. And you see this a lot of times with the research that's done
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.840]   on lotto winners, you see this with the research that's done on trust fund kids, you see this,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:17.600]   that achievement, that the need to do something, the need to work and to be productive,
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:28.800]   and the need to meet a challenge is directly related to your success. And so the idea that
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:35.280]   we're just going to walk away from work, the idea that we're going to walk away from challenge,
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.880]   and that we're just going to get to the point where life is hunky-dory and there's no need to,
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.920]   there's no need to work. I mean this is a real problem that we've got to be aware of.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.520]   I've been reading the book called You're Not That Great by Daniel Crosby, and he goes into,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.160]   I think I mentioned this on a previous show, he goes into in detail on the research on
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.480]   self-esteem and what he finds is that the biggest predict, one of the biggest predictors of people
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.800]   with self-esteem and success is not being told that you are just good at something,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.600]   that you're skilled at something, but rather those who work have to work and have to work
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.680]   at achieving something. And so it's far more powerful to compliment your children on the
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.000]   work that they put into something rather than it is to tell them that they're just very good at it.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.920]   And so I find it really interesting, I find it really interesting, the study, and I'm interested
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.960]   in reading a couple of these books about the Grant study. So also one thing I'm going to pull
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.840]   from the Wikipedia article in the Grant study, so he talks about alcoholism as a major problem,
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.640]   major cause of divorce, neuroses, and depression, and that follows alcohol abuse rather than
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.920]   preceding it. And alcoholism with the associated cigarette smoking is the single greatest
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.640]   contributor to people's early morbidity and death, which those are the same thing, so I don't know
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.520]   why they put both words in there. You can tell that Wikipedia contributor, morbidity means death.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.760]   Financial success, however, here's the point I want to make, financial success depends on
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.960]   warmth of relationships and above a certain level, not on intelligence. So this is interesting,
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:13.440]   those who scored highest on measurements of warm relationships earned an average of $141,000 a
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:20.000]   year more at their peak salaries, usually between ages 55 and 60. And there was no significant
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.440]   difference in maximum income earned by men with IQs in the 110 to 115 range and men with IQs
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.360]   higher than 150. To me, this is a major takeaway, and we're going to go right next after this into
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.240]   some jobs discussions and some articles that I found on employment figures. But the ability to
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.520]   be socially competent, the ability to develop and maintain good relationships is a major,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.280]   major contributing factor to success in life, including financial success. I remember reading
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.280]   a book, I think it was popular in the 80s or 90s, I don't remember, but it's called Emotional
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:59.360]   Intelligence. And it was talking about how one of the greatest predictors of people's success in
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.760]   life was their emotional intelligence, their ability to empathize with other people. And to
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.560]   me, this makes intuitive sense. I don't remember the research that was done in that book as far as
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:15.600]   from a statistical basis. But to me, this makes intuitive sense. Because in work, in life, and in
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.720]   relationships, everything that we do is based upon our work with others. And everything that we do,
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.440]   we have to interact with human beings. And so the people who are the most effective and the most
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.880]   skilled at interacting with other human beings and leading them and inspiring them, whether this is
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.840]   in a marriage, interacting with your spouse and inspiring that person to continue to love you,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.800]   to inspiring that person to continue to work with you towards the achievement of common goals,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.880]   whether this is in companies, whether this is in communication. If we can't inspire other people
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:59.600]   and really have positive relationships, it's very difficult to understand how to make a lot of
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:06.640]   money. So if you're not making very much, if you're struggling with your income, consider more
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:12.320]   or in addition to learning technical skills, spend some time considering developing and
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   practicing social skills. The good thing is the social skills are learned. And a lot of times,
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.480]   if our parents were very skilled socially, the ability to maintain healthy relationships,
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:31.200]   that can be a major benefit for us. And then we can intuitively just pass that along.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.760]   Now, one other thing I want to point out from this research by
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:40.160]   Valen, or excuse me, Valen, George Valen from this book, looking from his book called Aging
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.280]   Well, the Surprising Guideposts to a Happier Life from the Landmark Study of Adult Development.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:51.120]   So this is an interesting, this seems like an interesting book to me. And in the Amazon
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.240]   review, the editorial review here, one of the things that I thought that was really, really key,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.760]   and again, this is primarily interviews with people in their 70s and their 80s.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.680]   And I love talking to old people because I figure you're talking with old people,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.040]   you're going to get a bit of a perspective into the things you should pay attention to when you
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.160]   knew. And I've read various of these books. There's lots of them out there, but this one's
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:18.080]   interesting to me. One paragraph here. We also learn what makes old age vital and interesting.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:26.080]   Valen discusses the important adult developmental tasks such as identity, intimacy, and generativity
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.520]   giving to the next generation and provides important clues to a healthy, meaningful,
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:38.480]   satisfying old age. Health in old age, we learn, is not predicted by low cholesterol or ancestral
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.480]   longevity, but by factors such as a stable marriage, adaptive coping style, which is the
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:51.200]   ability to make lemonade out of life's lemons, and regular exercise. Valen is empathetic and
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.120]   sometimes surprisingly poetic. Owning an old brain, you see, is rather like owning an old car.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.880]   Careful driving and maintenance are everything. So to me, this is a fascinating point, just in
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.760]   this summary, is that health is predicted not by low cholesterol, but by factors such as a
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.680]   stable marriage, adaptive coping style, and regular exercise. So I struggle with the exercise
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.760]   bit. I'm trying to transform that habit, but I've never found exercise that I've enjoyed and
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.080]   really working hard to figure out how to incentivize myself to make that a lifelong habit,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.680]   because whether it's from preventing Alzheimer's disease or aging effectively or just maintaining
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.920]   physical health, that's always been a struggle for me. So I'm working on that one. The adaptive
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.960]   coping style I see is really valuable. It is also the importance, the ability to say, no matter what
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.760]   the challenge is going to be okay. And I think we can really do a lot with that with good financial
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   planning. By always having a backup plan and by really developing a good financial plan,
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.080]   we can have backup plans. And then by not overstressing ourselves. So for example,
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.280]   maybe not staying out of debt, not going deeply into debt to fund a business venture, where the
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.600]   pain of failure can be more than the pain of success. Maybe better to avoid some of those
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.240]   difficult situations, but yet still realizing and doing it in an intelligent way, like I talk about,
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.200]   do it in an intelligent way, so that if all goes wrong, life does not end at bankruptcy. Life does
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.480]   not end at credit card debt. It continues going on. And then also factors such as a stable marriage.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.280]   So having a stable marriage. I'll tell you the number one biggest financial mistake that I see
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.320]   in financial planning work, getting divorced. So if we can avoid that and build a stable marriage
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.480]   over time, this can make a dramatic difference in our personal happiness and well-being.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:38.960]   And I'm using his book here as evidence towards my hypothesis and also towards our financial
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.760]   well-being. It is very expensive and a major problem of getting divorced. Both because,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.720]   in general, divorce will split up assets, but it also just divides the economies of scale.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.560]   So two people living and working together have major economies of scale that are not available
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.120]   to one person on their own. So just simply consider that in your own financial planning
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:04.480]   and make sure that you are giving time and attention. Like I talk about with alternative
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.920]   investments, it may be a better investment to take a weekend, hire a babysitter for the kids,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.200]   and go to a marriage retreat or a marriage seminar with your spouse. That may be a better
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.080]   investment than putting money into your IRA. Not saying it always is, but maybe better than putting
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.080]   money in your IRA. So consider that and consider giving yourself permission to spend on those
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.600]   things. Investing in a gym membership likely would be a better investment than putting money
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:35.120]   into the IRA. I remember there's a famous quote by Richard Branson talking about how exercise gives
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.840]   him a couple of additional hours of productivity every day. And I personally struggle with this
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.520]   one because I hate to spend money on a gym. I hate to spend that money, but yet I don't seem
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:52.320]   to have the internal discipline and motivation to force myself to daily be active without it.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:58.080]   So I kind of have to justify it saying this is an investment. By investing in my health,
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.880]   that will pay off major dividends. That will pay off major dividends. All right, moving on to
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.680]   job numbers. So I find the job numbers interesting. And so in job numbers, we're going to read here
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:16.800]   from a Yahoo Finance article from this morning, July 21 at 10 a.m. So this is NABE survey points
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.600]   to rising U.S. wage pressures. And this is a Reuters story. And I'm going to read a couple
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.360]   paragraphs here. Washington, Reuters. The share of U.S. companies raising wages more than doubled
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:33.280]   in three months to July from a year ago, a survey showed on Monday suggesting a faster pace of wage
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.320]   growth. The National Association for Business Economics, NABE, latest business conditions
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:44.800]   survey found that 43 percent of the 79 economists who participated said their firms had increased
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:53.120]   wages. That compared to only 19 percent last year and marked that compared to only 19 percent last
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.600]   year and marked an increase from 35 percent in the three months to April. That was confusing.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.880]   Quote, for the third survey in a row, an increasing share of panelists reported rising wage costs last
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.760]   quarter, said NABE President Jack Kleinheinz, who was also chief economist at the National
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:14.000]   Retail Federation. It was the first time since October 2012 that no respondents reported declining
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.200]   wages at their firms. The economists represented a broad spectrum of businesses, including goods
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.080]   producing, transportation, finance and services industries. Forty percent of the firms employ
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.240]   more than 1,000 people. So I'm going to skip some of the paragraphs here and skip to the end here.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.320]   One last paragraph. It says, while the share of businesses reporting that they could not find
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   qualified workers slipped three-tenths of a percentage point to 22 percent,
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:47.040]   skills shortages remained the dominant theme. I want to focus on that. There is very much
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.680]   a supply and demand relationship with employment. So assume you ignore everything I say with
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:57.600]   entrepreneurship and you want to stay in the world of employment. Absolutely nothing wrong
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:04.080]   with that if that's the path that you choose. But consider this paragraph. Skills shortages
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.280]   remained the dominant theme. In every study and everything I read about employment, I find this.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.320]   Right now, people say, "Well, there's high unemployment." But the thing is that there's not.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.280]   But it depends on the segment. So anytime you read articles and say, "Well, there's massive
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.200]   unemployment. Look, the economy is terrible." There are businesses and there are industries
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:29.120]   in which jobs are booming that are absolutely just taking off in an incredible way. But then
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.000]   there are industries and businesses where there is nothing, where there are no financial prospects.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.040]   And the key is that it is -- here's one thing I'd like to share. If you've never hired somebody,
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.080]   I would encourage you to figure out how to start a business and get yourself in the position of
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.480]   hiring someone. And then even if you choose to never be an entrepreneur again, and you want to
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.040]   be in a situation where you just simply work for other people, you will have an opportunity then
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.960]   to appreciate how challenging it is to find good help and how challenging it is to find someone
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.680]   who is able to help you with what you need. And hiring people is one of the most difficult
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.440]   things that employers do. Employers want employees, but they want skilled employees.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.120]   And so your job prospects do not come from how great your resume is, unless your resume is
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.160]   reflecting skills. They don't come from how good at interviewing you are, unless your interview
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.600]   is conveying skills. So spend less time on here's how to interview, although I think that's probably
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.240]   one important piece, and spend more time developing skills. And a lot of times we have this
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.240]   the other way around. We say, "Well, I'm going to demand more from an employer. I'm going to go out,
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.320]   I'm going to ask for more, and then I'm going to go ahead and develop the skills." Why don't you
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   start by developing the skills first? And skill acquisition can be done at a very cheap price in
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.360]   today's world. So if you find yourself in a difficult financial position, spend some time
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:53.200]   thinking about what would be your ideal job, ideal business, ideal industry, and then figure out,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:32:00.080]   "What do I need to do to develop skills? What do I need to do to develop skills in an area that is
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.640]   in demand?" So one article I want to reference here, this is from Clark Howard's blog, and his
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.600]   is called "Top 10 Jobs in Demand Right Now," and this was posted July 9th, so a couple weeks ago,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.240]   by Clark Howard. "We're in an age when there's real disconnect between skill sets and job
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:22.960]   openings. That's created a lot of demand in some high-paying fields. Many of the job openings that
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:29.600]   are going unfilled require you to go back to school to get more education. STEM jobs, which
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:35.760]   involves the field of science, technology, engineering, or math, are particularly hot
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:41.840]   right now. Here's a partial list of the kinds of jobs that are available along with average starting
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.520]   salary. Top 10 jobs with lots of openings and great starting salaries. Petroleum engineers start
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:55.600]   at $85,000. Senior landmen start at $55,000. Software engineers start at $60,000. Electrical
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.840]   engineers start at $60,000. Mechanical engineers start at $55,000. Software developers start at
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:08.560]   $55,000. Financial analysts start at $50,000. Communication coordinators start at $35,000.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.400]   Marketing coordinators start at $35,000. Certified public accountants start at $45,000.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.400]   Continuing education is core to our future as a nation. You've got to morph yourself over time to
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:26.320]   fit the job market as it changes over time. That's key to our future, now and tomorrow.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.520]   Other top careers in demand might surprise you. If you're looking for work and you don't want to go
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.680]   back to a traditional four-year college, there's one industry you might want to consider with
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.520]   average pay around $50,000. It's trucking. Now, I know truckers themselves will tell you theirs
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:46.000]   isn't a field you should enter into lightly. But if you're unemployed or involuntarily working
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.880]   part-time, you might want to give this a second look. Trucking companies are so short of workers
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.360]   to drive loads that they're having to turn away business, according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.680]   You may have heard deliveries have been late because of this. Just-in-time delivery for
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.160]   factories will be the next domino to fall. Factories that run on lean inventories with
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:09.520]   just hours of parts in stock have long relied on trucks to be their warehouse. But if the current
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:14.960]   vacancies in trucking continue, those factories are going to need inventory on hand and will find
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.920]   themselves in a real bind. Maybe trucking is not what you're interested in, but there are
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.720]   opportunities out there and it is possible to find some careers in demand that might be a better fit.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:30.640]   One of the best ideas is to move to where the work is. America's heartland is rolling in jobs and
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:36.480]   riches. Our nation's heartland is derisively labeled "flyover country" by media types in New
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.280]   York and Los Angeles. But the nation's breadbasket is actually overflowing with bread, according to
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.880]   recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Per capita income is up roughly 4% over the last
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.640]   four years for the 50-plus million who live in the heartland. This is a reversal of a long-standing
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:35:00.480]   trend where wealth flowed to coastal metropolises like New York and Los Angeles. USA Today reports
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.840]   America's midsection is doing just fine. For example, North Dakota has high-paying jobs in
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.120]   the booming energy industry going unfilled and there is a severe shortage of housing for workers.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:17.360]   Just to give you an idea, I've heard anecdotally and read reports that jobs at McDonald's start at
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:23.440]   $17 an hour in some locales in North Dakota. That right there gives you an idea of prevailing wages
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.160]   in other sectors of the economy. So North Dakota and its heartland neighbors offer an opportunity
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.800]   that so many have overlooked. Sully County in South Dakota was singled out as another place
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.000]   that experienced per capita income growth of 70% over the course of the last four years.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.360]   Of course, living and working in these places comes with a sacrifice involving the severe winters.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.920]   You've got to be a hardy sort to deal with it, to be sure. But the idea is we've always been a
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.320]   people to migrate where the opportunity is. A lot of us couldn't move because of the housing
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.520]   lock during the recession. Yet today we have fewer people upside down in their homes. So we are in a
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.800]   time when most of us, if we choose, can be on the move. Now you may not be of a mind to pick up and
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.360]   relocate. Though if having more opportunity for yourself, your future, or your family is top
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.640]   priority, then being on the move is something you might want to at least consider. So I think Clark
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:19.280]   did a great job with this article and I really respect him. He's one of my favorite commentators.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.160]   He does a good job with his show and I would encourage you to listen to it. I think you would
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.320]   enjoy it. He does a really good job with the constraints that are on him as far as producing
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:32.160]   a popular entertainment show. And he's authentic and sincere in my opinion. So he does a good job.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:38.080]   So I want to tie these articles together and talk about how all of these things can connect.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:47.280]   And here's why. Anytime you look at a massive across the board analysis, it's going to show
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.760]   an average. But you are not average. You can do something different. You have the choice.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.840]   So I don't have any plan that's going to fix all of the economic problems of the world,
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:03.280]   but we could design dozens and dozens and dozens of potential plans to fix all of your economic
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.760]   problems or all of my economic problems. Now everything comes with choices and trade-offs.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.120]   There's an opportunity cost to every single course of action that we pursue. Some courses
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.360]   of action we may be willing to accept those opportunity costs. Some courses of action we
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.440]   may not be willing to accept those opportunity costs. And it will be different for each of us.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.320]   But I'll give you an example of one example that I heard. I was in a cigar shop maybe seven or eight
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.840]   years ago. I enjoy hanging out if you're not a cigar smoker. I enjoy hanging out in cigar shops
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.560]   because you got nice couches. You got leather couches. You can sit and you can just chat with
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.120]   people on an ongoing period of time. I tell my wife it's the last remaining bastion of manliness,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.960]   that and the barbershop if you get a good male-oriented barbershop if you're a guy.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.680]   So I'm in this cigar shop and I was in there and it was a morning on something like a midweekday
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.680]   morning. And I was in there because I was avoiding work that I needed to be doing. I was avoiding
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   the difficult work of picking up the phone and calling prospects and clients for
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   my financial planning business. So I was avoiding that and wasting time. And I'm sitting there
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.480]   talking to this guy who was clearly financially independent. He was wealthy and he was just
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.280]   sitting there enjoying a cigar. And he was a neat guy. I don't remember what his name was.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.480]   A real big black guy. Just a real neat guy. And we talked for quite a while. And he was telling
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:29.600]   me about his experience. And he was talking about his experience of trucking. And I asked him how
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:34.160]   he built his wealth. And he said, "Well, I was flat on my back and I went and I got a trucking job.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.080]   And I didn't have a place to live. I lived in my truck. And then I sold that one. I bought a truck
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.160]   of my own and I built a trucking company up. And I built this trucking company and I built it to,
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.680]   I don't remember how many trucks he had, but he had a couple dozen trucks. And then I sold it and
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.320]   I retired." And we were talking. He was just sharing some of his business lessons. And an
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:39:00.640]   awesome, awesome experience. Real big guy. Never had any formal business training or never had any
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.480]   formal education. But he had figured out this path to allow him to achieve what he was looking to
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:12.240]   achieve. And so when I read stories like this, my mind kind of bursts with ideas that could be put
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.480]   in place. So let's say that you wanted to, let's say that you read this job. Let's just go based
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.320]   upon Clark Howard's article. And hear me out. I'm not saying what you should do. You got to design
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.000]   what you should do. I wouldn't follow necessarily all these plans I'm about to spit out. But here's
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.040]   how I could see these things coordinated. So you want one of these top 10 jobs. You're unemployed.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.560]   You're unemployed and don't have any money. You're totally broke. You are mid-career, you're midlife
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.000]   or something like that. You're unemployed and don't have any money. And you would like to call
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.520]   a financial planner, but you don't have any ideas about how things could go better. You don't have
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.920]   any marketable skills. You don't have any ability. You don't have any marketable skills. All right.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.000]   So you read this list of top 10 jobs and you just pick one. And it says, "Software developers start
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.080]   at $55,000." And I'm picking that because it's a little bit easier. I've never been an electrical
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.000]   engineer. But any of these, you could do these with any of these. So you say, "Here's a top 10
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.320]   job with lots of openings and a great starting salaries. But I don't have any skills." Well,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   what I could do is I could become a trucker. So you could say, "I could become a trucker
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.480]   and I'm going to go and do that. And I should, whether it takes me a couple of
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.720]   weekends to learn how to drive a big rig. And I know this is a challenging field,
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.080]   but I don't want to do it forever, but I'm going to do it for a period of time. So I'm going to
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.920]   learn how to drive a big rig. And I'm going to take a long haul over the road trucking job."
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.200]   Well, so you go and shoot, maybe you have to put the money on a credit card to go to school and go
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.000]   to your trucking school and get your class A trucking license. Then you sell your stuff and
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.840]   you move into the truck. Now, is this something fun that you should do forever? No, but I can
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.480]   make a way to make it fun. So first of all, if you're willing to just be on the road full time,
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.240]   you could probably afford to work for someone who has a nice truck where they've got a big
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.480]   sleeper in it or get your own that's a nice truck that has a big sleeper in it. So you basically
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:58.000]   have a small RV that you're living in. Truckers are mandated only a certain number of hours that
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.040]   you have to drive every day. So I love going to truck stops with my wife and I travel. And you'll
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.240]   see the truckers are always in there on their rest. They're sitting there watching TV. They're
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.160]   sitting there reading newspapers. Now, I know not all of them, but I watch a lot of them standing
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.920]   out in the parking lot talking to each other. I see a lot of people really just wasting time.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.840]   Now, everyone has the... I'm not mad at people for wasting time. That's fine. But think about
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   the time that you have available when you live in your house and you work in your house and you're
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.560]   on the road. With the world of podcasting, with the world of the internet, with the world of
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:32.000]   YouTube, with the world of iTunes University, with the world of massive open online coursework,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.720]   or in the world of Stanford where they have unlimited employment opportunities, unlimited
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.960]   classes distributed for free online. Why don't you turn your drive time into learning time,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   listening to podcasts, learning about coding, listening to classes, and do your best to listen
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.920]   to the non-technical stuff while you are driving. And then when you're parked and on your rest time,
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.240]   take your rest time and take your time relaxing. But when you're parked, when you're off duty,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.560]   then you have the ability to do the technical coursework. Take your computer, learn online,
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.760]   develop the ability or the skill to become a CPA. Study for the CPA exam. Develop the skill. And so
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.360]   with the CPA, I think you have to have a college degree. So maybe you need to go and get a study
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:18.640]   online college degree from an inexpensive provider. And then you can sit for the CPA exam
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.360]   and study that while you are trucking across the country. Live in your truck, save 90% of your
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.600]   income. If you're feeling deprived because you're living in a truck, then take some of the money
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.160]   that instead of spending it on rent in an apartment that you're never in, take some of the money and
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:40.800]   spend it on going to fun resort places and hanging out in fancy hotels while you're on your weekends
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.680]   off or whatever it is that you have. So this is something that husbands and wives could do.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.960]   I bet it's something that could be done with kids, although that would not be my first thing. It may
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.880]   be easier for a single person. I've heard of long haul trucking teams of couples that in their 50s
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.760]   or 60s didn't have any money. And they said, well, let's go get paid to go see the world,
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   see the country from the interstate and save almost 100% of their income. And by not having
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.080]   to support the lifestyle at home, you can save almost 100% of your income and build up a financial
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:14.000]   nest egg and have an incredible start to life. So this is just one example. I don't know if that's
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.920]   right. I've never been a trucker. I'm sure it's a difficult job. I know it is. I know you spend a
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.440]   lot of hours. But it's the type of thing where you could apply a couple of these things to your
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.360]   situation. You could go be a trucker up in North and South Dakota. You can go up there. You can
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:34.320]   bank that money. You can buy a cheap camper and go and work at McDonald's up in South Dakota or
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:39.200]   North Dakota, make 17 bucks an hour, save the money, and build your education. So you can do
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:45.360]   these kinds of things. You can exploit the inefficiencies that exist in this market.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.600]   And you could get your education needs that you need to go into one of these higher demand jobs.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.480]   And over a period of time, three, four, five years, I don't know, you could build a plan that works.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.080]   So that would just be an example of how when I read these articles, I say, "Well, yes, there are
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:07.840]   these large overall systemic problems, but yet there's a lot that can be done to exploit your
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.560]   own situation and to build in your own advantages." Look for an area where you can exploit an
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:18.000]   inefficiency in the marketplace to build a better plan for yourself. And that would be one example
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.600]   that I thought of when thinking about these jobs. Also, as Clark pointed out in his article, don't
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.520]   be scared to move. If you are willing to move, don't be scared to change jobs, change industries,
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:33.120]   if that's something that you can do and are willing to do. A lighter note here,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.240]   Amazon officially announces the Kindle Unlimited, offering endless reading and listening for $9.99
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:43.280]   a month. So I thought this was a cool announcement that I found last week, that Amazon is offering
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.480]   over 600,000 books for free reading on the Kindle and Kindle enabled devices, as well as thousands
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.920]   of audio books from Audible. So I thought this was pretty cool. And it's a neat development in
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.080]   that marketplace. And if you're living in a truck and working in a truck, then you might be in a
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:03.120]   good position where you are able to exploit this. And for $10 a month, you've got an unlimited
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:10.480]   library without having to go to an actual physical library. So consider this. Now, I found one article
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.160]   by Jonathan Ping over at My Money Blog, and he had checked out his article. It's called Kindle
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:23.040]   Unlimited Review, Personal Finance and Investing Books. So the claim is that they claim over 600,000
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.280]   titles, Amazon does, in their library. All of that number is padded by a lot of little-known
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.720]   self-published e-books. Thousands of those books come with free audio book versions. You can read
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.840]   unlimited books, maximum 10 out at once, and on any Kindle app. It's a library card with 24/7
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.880]   instant availability. But how well-stocked is this virtual library? So he made a listing of his
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:51.200]   personal finance books that he takes out. So he's got a list here of William Bernstein's
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.760]   recommended reading list for young investors, and Millionaire Next Door, not available on this right
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.240]   now. Common Sense on Mutual Funds, no. Devil Take the Hindmost, no. Great Depression, no.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.680]   Your Money and Your Brain, no. How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street, no. All About Asset
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:11.680]   Allocation, no. Flash Boys, yes. Pound Foolish, no. Think Like a Freak, no. Capital in the 21st
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:16.480]   Century, yes. Thinking Fast and Slow, no. And then his five personal favorite financial books,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.240]   Your Money or Your Life, Work Less, Live More, The Richest Man in Babylon, The Four Pillars of
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.120]   Investing in a Random Walk Down Wall Street, no. So sounds like if you're interested in the personal
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.600]   finance space, this probably isn't going to work right yet. But I would say this is just the start,
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:35.040]   and this is going to be an amazing development over time, where when Amazon is offering this for
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:40.160]   Kindle, that there's an opportunity to do that. And there's an amazing opportunity here to,
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.360]   on a very low price, get unlimited access to books. And that's going to be a really great
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:51.280]   development in the market. And I'm sure that the access to the personal and finance sections will
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.120]   change over time. And so I'm sure that this is a good development. I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.280]   Check it out. See if it will serve you, and see if it's something that you can implement in your
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:06.320]   own life. Next story here is from Yahoo Finance, and the title is called The Myth of Economic
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.920]   Patriotism. And the byline here is July 17. And I thought this was a fun article. I'm going to
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.760]   point it out to you, because I thought it was a good illustration of how no matter what the
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.800]   political situation is, you will always have companies that can work around it and work
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:28.240]   through it, and they will make decisions that are in the best interest of their owners. So I am a
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:34.080]   political pessimist with any ability to change things politically. But I do think that as people,
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:39.200]   as politicians, do stupid things, pass more legislation, take more money, you will always
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:45.440]   have people making decisions. And people are going to make decisions. And there's a point in time
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:54.880]   at which we'll all say, "Okay, that's enough." Now, this is why you've seen, in reality, very
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:01.040]   little change in individual income tax rates over the last several decades, is that there's been
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:06.080]   very little change for the middle class. Because, it's my opinion, I'm speculating, but I think the
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:13.120]   politicians understand and realize that if you increase taxes significantly on the middle class,
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:18.080]   you upset the apple cart. And so they can increase taxes on the highest income earners,
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.920]   but if they increase them across the board, they're going to have a problem. So I don't expect
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.560]   major changes in tax policy to change just simply because of this reality. And here would be some
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.360]   evidence that I would employ to do it. Which, by the way, one of my little asides, I don't
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:37.680]   understand why they wouldn't just... It seems smart to me, why don't we just scrap the income tax or
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:43.440]   switch to a completely different version? Because wealthy people get wealthy by looking for
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.960]   opportunities and things that they can exploit. That's one of the things that you got to do. You
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.280]   got to look for an inefficiency. And wealthy people are willing to pay for good advice. So
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.240]   they're willing to pay guys like me or guys much smarter than me. I'm not that smart. There's guys
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.720]   a lot smarter than me to sit around and read the tax code to find the loophole that they can
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:06.400]   exploit. That was how 401ks came out. There was a pension consultant, I think his name was Jack
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.480]   Benna or something like that, who was sitting there reading the... He was a pension consultant.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.400]   He's sitting there reading the tax code and he says, "Wait a second, I can do this." And a major
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.800]   change happens. So wealthy people are willing to pay people for advice. So I'm going to try to give
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.120]   you the advice for free, but let's read this article. "CEOs get paid very well to deal with
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:29.440]   every challenge that pops up. Now there's a new one. Proving they practice 'economic patriotism.'
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   This new form of patriotism has become an issue now that several big US companies have decided
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.960]   to relocate their headquarters to other countries in order to lower their tax bill. These so-called
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:47.040]   tax inversions require a merger with a foreign company. A strategy big firms such as AbbVie,
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   Milan, Walgreen, Medtronic, Chiquita Brands, and others have been pursuing. Since the US
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:58.080]   corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the developed world, moving overseas can save a bundle
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:03.040]   of money. Reforming and simplifying the US tax code might solve the problem, except a fitful
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.640]   Congress obsessed with political spitball fights is unlikely to take that up anytime soon. In a July
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:13.840]   15 letter to congressional leaders pleading for some kind of action, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:20.080]   proclaimed, "What we need as a nation is a new sense of economic patriotism where we all rise or
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.760]   fall together." Some tax inverters are more susceptible to charges of sedition than others.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.000]   Since Walgreen, Milan, and AbbVie are in the healthcare business, for instance,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.320]   they earn considerable revenue from taxpayer-funded programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.640]   So they're seeking to slash their own obligations to Uncle Sam while benefiting directly from the
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.440]   payments of others, a contrast the New York Times described as "morally disconcerting."
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:49.200]   While other patriotic calls have unified the nation, however, Lew's plea for economic patriotism
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:54.000]   has provoked political opponents. In a rebuttal to Lew's letter, the conservative editorial page of
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.200]   the Wall Street Journal characterized the letter as a political stunt while declaring that "Mr.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.840]   Lew doesn't know much about economics. Mr. Lew's letter shows that the White House now wants to
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:10.240]   exploit the inversion flurry as an election year opportunity to demagogue business." Political
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.920]   infighting over the mercenary behavior of corporate America raises an intriguing new question. What is
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:22.160]   economic patriotism anyway? Lew, in his "rise or fall" remark, seems to suggest U.S. companies
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.560]   ought to align themselves with the fortunes of the American middle class and go down with the
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.280]   ship if that's where the middle class is heading. But Lew, who was a senior Citigroup executive
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:37.680]   from 2006 through 2009, surely knows that is not how public companies operate. The main job of a
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.720]   CEO is to optimize the return to shareholders, period. It's nice when that primary mission
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:48.080]   coincides with feel-good national policies, but when it doesn't, shareholders come first. And
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.120]   with nearly half of all revenue for American big firms coming from foreign sales, it's imperative
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:58.240]   for those firms to remain competitive against rivals in other nations that face a lower tax
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:04.000]   burden and are eager to exploit any cost advantage they can. I'm going to pause here. Notice two
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.200]   things from one of this. First of all, it says that a CEO's major job, major goal, is to optimize
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:15.520]   the return to shareholders. I like that definition of return, because return leaves it open to
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.280]   describe it in financial return, return on capital, return on equity, or it also opens it up to
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.600]   describe it in other return. And so a share, depending on how the company is structured,
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.400]   that opens up for companies to maximize their return to their shareholders based upon other
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:34.560]   non-financial aspects. So you'll see this is a big move right now that's happening in companies.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:44.080]   The second thing, however, here is notice that these statistics. With nearly half of all revenue
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:50.320]   for America's big firms coming from foreign sales, it's imperative for those firms to remain
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:56.400]   competitive against rivals in other nations that face a lower tax burden and are eager to exploit
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.520]   any cost advantage they can. One of the things I see, one of the major mistakes that I see people
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:08.960]   make when it comes to investing is that they focus on the politics or the market, not the
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.520]   companies. They're focusing on the society, the country, not the companies. That would be the
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.680]   best way to say it. They focus on the countries and not the companies. Half of all revenue for
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:22.320]   America's largest companies comes from other countries. So right there, no matter how great
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:27.040]   or bad America's prospects, people say, "Why is it that we have certain prospects and certain
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.880]   economic situations in the United States of America, and why do these numbers not seem to
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.920]   be reflected in the financial performance of large American firms?" Because half of all revenue comes
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:40.400]   from foreign sales from outside the country. The second thing is no matter how onerous the
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:46.160]   country, there's going to be, no matter how onerous the restrictions and regulations,
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.960]   a good CEO and a good board of directors is going to be protecting their country's interests.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:57.600]   And so if Walgreens can merge with another carrier and move abroad, then they can cut their tax rate
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.440]   for their shareholders. It doesn't matter where their shareholders are. And so I love this
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.600]   development. I think this is awesome because it brings in the idea of international competition.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:10.240]   One of my favorite countries in the world, or I guess it's technically a special administrative
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.280]   region now, I guess we can still call it a country, is Hong Kong. And so in China, you can
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.400]   go to Hong Kong and you can just see that it's one of the most alive, bustling, busiest places in the
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.320]   world. And they are competing with each other. You've got Singapore and Hong Kong competing.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.360]   They compete in different things. You've got all of the international stock exchanges. You've got
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.040]   all these international stock exchanges competing with one another where you don't just have the
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:38.400]   New York Stock Exchange. New York Stock Exchange is owned by, who is it? Is it London? Anyway,
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.920]   they're owned by an international company now. I don't remember the name of the company. So
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:48.960]   this is a major - I love this development. I bring on the competition because the only thing
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:55.120]   that's going to affect the politicians, that's going to move the politicians' hands to change
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.640]   things is competition. This is the same thing that's happening in states is that you have
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.360]   different states. And I'm skipping here the ranking in US states article, all included in
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:08.960]   the show notes, but just talking about the joblessness in states. And so ranking US states
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:15.280]   by job creation in the past five years. And so this ability to compete among states leads to
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.720]   some states having an extremely healthy job market. And finally, when people are just lingering and
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:27.120]   languishing in a place with no job market, why is it that Detroit has gone from a population of
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:32.960]   1.8 million people to 700,000, I think is the latest number that I remember. 1.8 million to
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:38.800]   700,000 because of the changes of there's no jobs. And so now these people move to Texas,
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.880]   they move to Florida, they move to other states that have - what is the state here that has the
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:50.800]   highest job rates? North Dakota, they moved to North Dakota. North Dakota is a 2.7% unemployment
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:56.160]   rate, whereas Mississippi and Rhode Island have 7.9% unemployment rates. And so now you figure
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.160]   out what is it that North Dakota is doing to compete and Michigan versus North Dakota,
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.280]   is there a dramatic difference in the climate? I don't know, I never lived in either place,
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:09.600]   but I would get - they both have snow. That's all I know for Florida. So this is awesome. I love
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:15.280]   this development because this will force people to compete. So if you want hedge - I mean,
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:22.520]   there's white hedge funds are based down in the - what's the name of that island down in -
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:29.280]   anyway, that island - it's not the Virgin Islands. It's not Barbados. Anyway, that island down in
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:35.200]   the Caribbean here that is where many of the big hedge funds are based. The Caymans, that's what it
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.440]   is, the Caymans. So the Cayman Islands, many hedge funds are based in the Cayman Islands and they're
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:46.960]   going to be based in another place where they're able to compete more effectively. And so I think
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.720]   this is fantastic. One - let me finish this out because there's a couple interesting - there's
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:59.360]   a couple interesting - a couple interesting more points that I want to believe. Corporate behavior
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:04.160]   obviously affects a company's image which can in turn affect profitability. But a company taking
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:09.040]   perfectly legal steps to minimize its tax bill isn't likely to generate enough outrage to impact
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:14.000]   its bottom line. This is why you see - this is why you see people - my commentary - this is why you
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   see the politician - you see Jack Lew trying to talk about economic patriotism. Americans are
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.240]   ambivalent about taxes at best and they tend to believe the government is a voracious money eater
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:29.040]   that wastes a lot of the tax revenue it brings in anyway. So even if U.S. consumers are uncomfortable
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.680]   with the idea of companies dodging taxes, they're not likely to resort to boycotts or other measures
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:39.200]   typically reserved for firms caught discriminating, trashing natural resources, or blatantly cheating.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.280]   If there are any economic traitors in this story, it's in fact it's not U.S. companies but the
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.080]   politicians who have left them with a booby-trapped tax code that creates powerful incentives to pay
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:53.440]   taxes someplace else. Republicans and Democrats agree the tax code has become a porous mess,
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:58.560]   riddled with loopholes only high-priced tax experts can comprehend. President Obama wants to fix it,
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:02.720]   but hasn't pressed for tax reform because other priorities seem to have a better chance of getting
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:07.200]   somewhere. Republicans want to fix the tax code too, but are waiting for some future date at which
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:11.440]   they hope to have more leverage in Congress and a better chance of enacting the tax changes they
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.560]   prefer. Believe that one when I see it. Businesses meanwhile must pay taxes in real time and can't
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:21.600]   wait for theoretical reforms from a legislative body with a response time of a decade or two,
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.160]   so business leaders are doing what's pragmatic, even if it's objectionable, maintaining their
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.720]   edge through whatever legal means are available. So this might be a reasonable way to define
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.760]   economic patriotism. Pay what you owe and nothing more, while funding other ways to show support for
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:40.000]   your nation and your country folk. If you're a business person who profits by operating in
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.320]   America, set up mentoring programs to help young people get ahead or go out of your way to hire
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.280]   the underprivileged or find some other way to give back. If you're a corporation, abide by the
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.440]   letter of the law, be honest with your shareholders about how you're making your money, and accept the
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.000]   consequences if American customers punish you for expediency. And if you're an ordinary voter,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.320]   you can show your economic patriotism by demanding the government adopt policies that make America
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.840]   indisputably the best place to start and run a business, instead of a winded giant that seems
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:13.920]   unable to keep up with the rest of the world. So I would say if you're an ordinary voter,
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.720]   just simply defund the whole system the best you can by listening to my show. And that will,
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:24.080]   money talks to politicians, money talks. So I commend that article to you. I just read you the
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:28.080]   whole thing. But I think it's an interesting, and I commend you to say if you want to have
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:33.600]   patriotism and in some other form, fine, go with it. But I suggest you follow these other people's
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:39.440]   advice, or I suggest that you follow these other businesses and business leaders
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.520]   path and avoid as many of these taxes as possible, because that will pay, that will work. In today's
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.800]   world, when a company can be headquartered anywhere in the world, whether they want to
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.760]   be headquartered in the Middle East, in Dubai, whether they want to in Hong Kong,
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.320]   and there's very little difference. And now you have more and more people willing to move there,
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   willing to pick up their belongings and go there and still be connected. You're going to have more
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:12.720]   and more and more of this. A couple more articles here. New York Times article from, called In a
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.360]   Subprime Bubble for Used Cars, Borrowers Pay Sky-High Rates. This is a lengthy article. I'm
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.920]   not going to read much from it, but I commend it to you to consider. And this is an interesting
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.880]   trend to watch, and it breaks my heart. But basically the idea is that there is a huge
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:35.360]   American movement, a surge in subprime lending for used cars. And so people who don't have much
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:45.120]   money and have poor credit history are taking out loans for themselves and buying cars. And the big
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:51.040]   one that bugs me about this one, and by the way, I don't know how you define huge. In 2006, there's
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:01:00.400]   a chart here. In 2006, 36% of loans, 36% of new auto loans were for subprime borrowers. In 2009,
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:06.320]   that had decreased to 20%. So it's steadily down. And then it increased from 2009 to 2013,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:13.280]   up to 20. Now it's up to 27%. So there's been a seven, an increase from 20% to 27% of new auto
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.920]   loans are to subprime borrowers. So is this a huge increase? I don't know. I don't know the
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.080]   history of this. I haven't researched it to know whether this is a normal trend moving around the
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:29.040]   mean, or is this a statistically important trend. But the key thing here is this, this bar, this
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:35.200]   one bothers me. It's so heartbreaking to see people deeply in debt to buy cars that they,
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.400]   deeply in debt to buy cars that they can't afford. They don't have the money to pay for them. They
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.880]   go deeply in debt, then their cars get repossessed, and they wind up paying much, much more money.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:56.960]   And we've got to stop this trend by changing the education, where instead of it being, let me go,
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.200]   now you have, in many ways, you do need to have a car and a car is a valuable,
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.160]   valuable asset to be able to get to work, especially if you're in a low, low income
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.600]   situation. We got to change this trend. And we got to stop people putting money into these junkie
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.600]   cars, which destroy their value, and they're heavily financed. I mean, it's, it's horrible.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.400]   It's, it's, it's absolutely horrible. That's why I hope people will listen to my show. And I hope
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.760]   that people will listen to my show and gain some knowledge on this. If you have an opportunity to
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.000]   help somebody, I've done some financial planning over the years with people, minimum wage earners
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.440]   and a very low income bracket. And the thing that I see just that breaks my heart is when they buy,
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.640]   buy cars, and you get into a situation where you bought a car on credit. And because you bought it
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.120]   on credit, the car depreciates to such a point where you're upside down in it substantially,
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.880]   where you owe more than it's worth. And then because you can't scrape to any cash, and you
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.840]   need a car, this is endless, this is horrible trap that you get into. You can't scrape together any
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.360]   cash because you need a car, and you don't have any cash. And so you have to make your monthly
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.760]   payments. Because let's say that you bought the car for $15,000. And it's actually worth you,
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.000]   but you paid retail price for it, you financed it, and you have $300 a month monthly payments,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.160]   but the car is only worth $10,000, maybe, depending on what you do. So, but you still need a car. So
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.360]   to get rid of the car would require you to come up with $5,000 to fund yourself getting out of the
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.320]   car. Plus, at least what, a couple thousand bucks for a new car, for another car, even if you could
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.440]   pay cash. And for someone in a minimum wage situation, for someone in a low, low income,
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.360]   low asset situation, for poor person, for broke person, to finance to get out, you need seven or
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.880]   8,000 bucks of cash. So and it's just not possible. So it's easier to deal with the pain of the $300
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.400]   a month payment, even though or the $400 a month payment, I did a plan one time for somebody tried
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.080]   to help and they wouldn't take my advice. So I wasn't able to help them. But I mean, the car
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:56.320]   payment was 50% of their of their income. And so do your best if you have an opportunity to help
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.040]   somebody with if you have an opportunity to help somebody in a situation to avoid the mistake in
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.520]   the first place, or to extend you know, a loan to get them out of it in some way. If there's someone
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.080]   that you know, try to help someone that's caught in this situation. And I really want to help us
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:15.200]   educate the American public so we can avoid this, this trap. And it's interesting thing in here
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.360]   about hedge funds are looking, there was one investment firm, I don't remember the name here,
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.440]   I think it was a hedge fund that was investing in these notes, and they're securitizing the notes
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.960]   and and buying the buying the securitized notes. So as a way of trying to get additional as a way
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.400]   of trying to get additional return in today's market. So I thought it was an interesting article,
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:38.000]   I commend it to you. Next last two articles, and then we are done for the day. I want to commend
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.880]   my friend Brandon over at the mad scientist. Well, I want to commend him for two things. The
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.200]   article that he wrote this week that caught my eye, it's called the Roth IRA horse race, but he's
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:55.040]   finished up his degree. And he is finishing out working on his on his financial plan of his his
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.720]   early and financial independence plan. And so I want to commend him for that he's been doing an
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.880]   awesome job. Check out his podcast if you're interested in some interviews with people
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.440]   who have pursued the financial independence path. And it's a really, really neat, really,
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.840]   really neat thing. But he wrote an article this week, called the Roth IRA horse race. And I hadn't
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.680]   is a strategy I've never thought about. And I want to thank him for doing that. I'd never thought of
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.920]   this, I think is an interesting strategy. Basically, the idea of a Roth IRA horse race and
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:26.480]   who this will be most helpful to is Brandon is his plans are built around earning a high income
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.560]   at a period of time and then quitting working. And then in quitting working because your income is
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:38.000]   low, adjusting your retirement account balances in such a way that you that you can convert your
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.920]   retirement accounts without because your income is so low, you don't pay any taxes. That's my
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.640]   simple answer. So these strategies that he's working on are really great strategies, but
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.880]   they're really great. They're going to be most applicable. If you are planning a plan, you're
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.120]   planning something where you're going to be working and then you're going to be quitting
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.520]   working, they will not work if you plan to continue working over time, or if you don't see
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.640]   yourself or if you're in a higher income, and you're not and you're going to be always earning
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:06.320]   a higher income. But that's not his plan. So his plan is he's working and then done. So he's using
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:12.800]   IRAs. And basically, the idea is to invest your money into a 401k plan and an IRA, not paying any
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:18.000]   income tax on the money. And then once you quit working, because your earned income is so low,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.560]   then to go ahead and start a plan of converting the money out of the IRA and converting the money
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:28.560]   out of the traditional 401k into a Roth IRA, but only converting as much as you can convert to stay
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:34.640]   in a 0% tax bracket. And then after doing the Roth IRA conversion, then building it up where after
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:41.040]   five years in the Roth IRA, you go ahead and distribute it out prior to 59 and a half in order
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.560]   to cover your expenses. So it's a neat strategy. And I would commend to you his guinea pig series
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.440]   that he has on his blog, where he has written some software and he's illustrating how the
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.280]   implementation of these strategies can really do a good job to reduce the tax burden and help you to
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.440]   be financially independent at a much earlier age. But one of his ideas here is his Roth IRA
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:07.600]   horse race. And so basically the idea is, let's say that every year you can convert from an IRA
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:14.560]   into a Roth IRA, and then you can recharacterize that conversion back if you want to undo it. So
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:20.080]   you would recharacterize it before the time that you file your taxes. And so the idea is that,
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.280]   let's say that you have a portfolio, you have a stock portfolio and a bond portfolio. And so you
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:31.760]   go ahead and convert in a year. You can pick up $10,000 of income to do a completely income tax
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:40.160]   free conversion for his simple numbers. And then you would convert $10,000 of your stock fund from
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.400]   a traditional IRA into a Roth account. And then in a separate account, you would convert $10,000
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:50.720]   of your bond fund into a separate Roth IRA. And then keep the fund separate to make it easier to
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.520]   recharacterize it back if you need to. So then let's, assuming that the market moves in one
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.920]   direction or the other, if at the end of the year, reading from his article here, your stock account
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:05.040]   has increased in value from $10,000 to $18,000, and your bond account has decreased in value from
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.760]   $10,000 to $6,000, then what you would do is you would just undo the recharacterization on the bond
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:17.600]   portfolio, and you would keep the stock portfolio. So this allows you to keep all $18,000 of the
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.800]   funds converted for the price of only $10,000. But if you had converted your entire portfolio,
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:28.080]   and you were maintaining a 50/50 split between your Roth, excuse me, between your stocks and
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.920]   your bonds, you'd only have a $12,000 in the Roth. So you got some free money in there by playing
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.600]   with your asset classes and doing the conversion. And then he goes through and talks about what if
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.880]   it did the other way, what if you had a decreased amount across the board, and how to undo those
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.920]   recharacterizations. I think it's awesome. Brandon, if you're listening, I don't see any
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.080]   problem in this. I think this is great. Except, man, how are you going to find a broker that will
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.560]   do this for you? I guess he's a Vanguardist. Maybe Vanguard will do it and make it simple.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.760]   That would be my only thing is that it's a bit of a hassle, and you're going to have to find a
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.640]   broker that's willing to deal with you for these small accounts and to deal with you to do these
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:10.240]   conversions and these recharacterizations. And I would imagine that you get that. Again, I haven't
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.640]   worked with Vanguard in a while. Maybe they'll do this for you. But I think it's a cool idea.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:19.360]   And I love that these little tricks that he's working on exist. So if you're interested in
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:24.560]   this kind of thing, go over and check out his Roth IRA horse race article and read some of his
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:30.000]   other articles on tax avoidance. He's doing a really brilliant job of developing some of the
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.760]   strategies and tools that you can implement in the scenario that I described of working for a
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.640]   period of time, saving aggressively and then quitting and using retirement accounts to avoid
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:50.320]   the taxes to really amp up your returns overall. Last article here is from a site. I'm going to
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.920]   put an infographic in on the site. It's from a site called Visual Capitalist, and this is entitled
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:02.320]   The Habits of the Wealthiest People. Now, this is based upon a book that I saw first a year or so
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.760]   ago. The author, I'd love to read his book. I haven't read it. He was a financial planner. Let's
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.760]   see here. He was a financial planner that wrote a book on, interviewed a bunch of rich people and a
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.600]   bunch of poor people, and he was trying to figure out what worked and what didn't. And so he wrote
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:23.520]   this book on the habits of the wealthy. Thomas Corley and his study of the daily habits of 233
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:30.480]   wealthy and 128 poor people. He gained a lot of notoriety when he got featured on the Dave Ramsey
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.840]   show, which was awesome for him because this fits in very well with what Dave Ramsey teaches
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.240]   on his show, is that wealth comes as a result of habits. And so he got featured on that show,
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:44.480]   and it really, really was a huge boon to him as far as his book sales. I haven't read his book
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.640]   yet. I would like to, and I'd like to interview him. I'm interested to know if this is actually
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:55.760]   statistically accurate. My statistical knowledge is limited to the point where I don't know if
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.120]   this is statistically accurate or not, but I do think it's an interesting, it's intuitively accurate
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.040]   based upon my experience, but that doesn't make it correct. So he's talking about what is the
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.280]   wealthy and what do wealthy people and what do poor people do. And I think I stole this from
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.880]   Dave Ramsey. He says that if you do what wealthy people do, you get wealthy, and if you do what
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.400]   poor people do, you get poor. And I think that's awesome. I think it's true. I would take a little
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:23.120]   bit wider than what Dave says, but hey, good for him. He can do it. He's got a much bigger footprint,
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:29.200]   and so he's got more experience than I do working with his wealthy friends. So maybe he's 100%
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.960]   right and I'm wrong. But first of all, how do they define wealthy in this study? Wealthy is defined
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.680]   as earning at least $160,000 annually and holding at least $3.2 million in assets, and then poor is
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.240]   defined as an income under $30,000 per year and less than $5,000 in assets. And so some of the
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.040]   habits of the rich, I'm just going to cherry pick a few here. They have a routine. So 81% of the
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.960]   rich versus 9% of the poor maintain a to-do list. 44% of the rich versus 3% of the poor wake up
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.720]   three plus hours before work. 63% of the rich versus 5% of the poor listen to audiobooks during
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.080]   their commute. I'm going to hope that they'll start listening to my show because it's free and
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.880]   they can just stream it online and hopefully we can help some people that are poor to get wealthy.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:19.680]   79% of the rich versus 16% of the poor network five plus hours or more each month. That one is
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:25.200]   easy to jump on from the perspective of ability if you talk to a minimum wage person and say,
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.240]   "Well, the person's working all the time." It's probably true. It's very challenging situations,
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.360]   but that's an interesting one. And then 88% of the rich versus 2% of the poor read 30 plus minutes
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:41.840]   or more each day. 86% of the rich versus 26% of the poor love to read. I thought that was
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.240]   interesting. These are interesting statistics. And what it sees at times ties together the theme
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.120]   of the show is that skills and knowledge lead to earning ability. So if you want to have earning
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:57.600]   ability and wealth, don't focus on first saying, "Well, how can I go out and get these? How can I
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.080]   go out and find the job?" Focus on building the skills and then find the job that is appropriate
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:08.480]   for that. Rich are healthy. They exercise aerobically four days a week. And 76% of the
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.520]   wealthy exercise aerobically and 23% of the poor. That one's interesting. And then the junk food
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:20.400]   calories, the poor have a higher consumption of junk food calories versus the wealthy. Although
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.640]   visually on the infographic, it's not that similar. The television habits, big difference in television
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:33.520]   habits. And this is the one where I'm glad that he has television habits on here versus time reading
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.400]   and networking. Because the complaint that would be made by people who are advocates for minimum
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.560]   wage laws and things like that is, "Look, it's not possible to work at minimum wage down at your
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:48.480]   local fast food restaurant and have enough time after supporting your family to read, to learn
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:57.680]   these things." Well, it looks like here it was 24% of the poor, excuse me, looks like about 65% of
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:05.440]   the wealthy versus 24% of the poor watch one or less hour of TV every day. So 65% of the wealthy
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.680]   watch less than one hour of TV, whereas only 24% of the poor watch less than one hour of TV. 76%
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:18.560]   of the poor watch reality TV versus this looks like 5% or 10% watch wealthy TV. And then goal
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:25.680]   setting. 67% of the rich write down their goals, 17% of the poor versus 17% of the poor. 80% of
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.480]   the rich focus on accomplishing a specific goal versus 12% of the poor. 86% of the rich believe
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.520]   in lifelong educational and self-improvement versus 5% of the poor. 84% of the rich believe
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:42.000]   good habits create opportunity versus 4% of the poor. And 76% of the rich believe bad habits have
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.200]   a negative impact versus 9% of the poor. And then he goes through some other numbers here. So I
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.720]   commend this infographic to you. I think it's well done. And I would like to read this book and
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:56.080]   report back to you on the future. It's one of those things that seems intuitively true. I question
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.280]   a little bit if it's statistically accurate with a sample set of 233 wealthy and 128 poor people.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.360]   And I don't know what his methodology was. That would be kind of the weak point. I'd love to see
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.080]   someone, I don't know, I'd check it out. And if any of you statisticians would have any knowledge
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.440]   on whether it's accurate or not, I would love to know that. So that's it for today's show,
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:20.480]   except I'm going to wrap up with a poem. And this is a poem that I first read a couple months
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:28.320]   ago when I was reading a blog called The Rebel Heart. And The Rebel Heart was a blog that was a
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:34.640]   name of a sailboat for this young couple that had worked really hard and had bought a sailboat. And
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.720]   they'd bought a sailboat and they were planning to save all their money and they were planning
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:46.400]   to sail around the world for basically the indefinite future. And they were doing in the
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.480]   middle of their Pacific crossing. In the middle of the Pacific crossing, they ran into substantial
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.880]   problems with a big storm and the big thing with their baby being sick. And they were way offshore
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.160]   and they had a sick baby and they weren't able to finish their voyage. And they wound up having
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:05.520]   to be rescued at sea. They had to scuttle their boat. And basically, it's a really inspiring and
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:14.080]   it's both inspiring and a just difficult story to kind of think about starting all over again.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.000]   So check out their blog. I'll put a link in the show notes. I think it's therebelheart.com. And
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.280]   then I think the husband's name is Eric and the wife's name is Charlotte. And I think they do it.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.520]   I've enjoyed reading some of their articles over the years. But he posted a link to a poem and I
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.400]   hadn't read it. And I read it a month or two ago, I think when he posted it. And I've just been
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.160]   thinking about it, referred to it a few times and I'd like to leave it with you today. And the poem
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:42.480]   is called If by Rudyard Kipling. And to me, it just ties together this show, at least for today,
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   and kind of what's on my mind. Meaning that there are many things that can happen. And you can choose
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.480]   your response to them. And I'm inspired by how this man is having to rebuild his dream with nothing.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:59.120]   Lost all of their physical possessions were on the boat. So all their physical possessions,
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.120]   their major investment into the boat to provide for their living situation, now that's gone. I
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.200]   hope they still have some other money saved that they were planning to have as well. But basically,
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:14.480]   starting over with nothing. But starting over and rebuilding again with nothing except the family,
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:20.160]   the love, and the love of his family, his children, thankfully everyone survived,
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.280]   and the skills and knowledge that he's developed. And there's no doubt in my mind that this family
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.680]   will be able to hit their dreams and goals again. And there's no doubt in my mind that they will be
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:36.080]   able to do so faster than they did the first time based upon their past knowledge. And I think they
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.200]   will enjoy the process getting there. But let me read this poem and with this will be done.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:46.320]   If by Rudyard Kipling. If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:52.400]   it on you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:59.840]   too. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about don't deal in lies, or being
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:07.680]   hated don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise. If you can dream and
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:13.120]   not make dreams your master. If you can think and not make thoughts your aim. If you can meet
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:19.760]   with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same. If you can bear to hear
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   the truth you've spoken, twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:32.960]   your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn out tools. If you can make one heap of
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.840]   all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss, and lose and start again at your beginnings
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:46.480]   and never breathe a word about your loss. If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.680]   your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:19:01.440]   which says to them hold on. If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:08.000]   nor lose the common touch. If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you. If all men count
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.200]   with you but none too much. If you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:22.960]   run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it, and which is more you'll be a man my son.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:32.720]   As we begin our week here on a Monday, I hope that you would be able to implement the words of
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:37.000]   that poem and some of the ideas that we've talked about. And I hope that each day of this week that
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.680]   you will be able to enjoy the love of your family and of your friends, that you will be able to
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.920]   enhance your own happiness, that you will make measurable progress towards your goals. I heard a
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.240]   definition years ago that happiness is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal. I
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.840]   can't remember who that originated with, but I hope you'll make measurable progress towards your
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.480]   goals, and I hope that some of the ideas that I've shared today have been helpful for you in some way.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:08.200]   That's it for today's show for Monday, July 21, 2014. All of the resources for today are at
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.680]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/24. Tomorrow I will be bringing you an interview with Jacob Lund Fisker,
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:20.680]   author of the early retirement extreme, the book and the blog. We recorded that on Saturday, and I
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.080]   will be actually traveling for the next couple of days. That will be released on Tuesday. On
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:29.320]   Wednesday, I plan to bring you another show. This one is going to be on the statement of cash flows,
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:33.680]   like we did the statement of financial condition last week, and talk about how powerful the
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.880]   statement of cash flows is once you actually understand it and understand how it works. Not
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.680]   sure what's coming on Thursday and Friday. Oh, Friday will be a Q&A show. I'm trying to get
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.280]   speak pipes set up so you can call in some questions. I haven't gotten the chance to do
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.120]   that. I will be traveling later today, so maybe tomorrow I will be able to get that going for you.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.360]   I hope this show was helpful for you. Thank you for those of you who have been leaving reviews.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.760]   Please consider, if you haven't, just that's what I ask of you. If this information has been at all
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:02.800]   helpful, I would be indebted to you if you would leave a review for us on iTunes and subscribe.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.680]   Subscribe and leave a review on iTunes. That will help us to get into the new and noteworthy
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:11.240]   section of the business section, which would be awesome. We're featured there in the investing
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:16.440]   section, and I hope that will help spread the rational message of the Radical Personal Finance
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:22.280]   Podcast, which is a rational approach to financial planning and goal setting and goal achievement.
