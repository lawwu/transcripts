[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.020]   in the right direction.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.800]   For episode number three, I wanted to talk about Darwinian evolution and how it relates
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.920]   to scientifically validated racism.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.360]   With the topic of race and social justice, I think it's important to recall and even
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.040]   take to task a Darwinian evolution for the reason I just stated and for several others
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.640]   I will make explicit in the course of this episode.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.960]   Just to save some energy and breath, throughout this episode I'll be referring to Darwinian
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:24.500]   evolution as DE because it will, frankly, save me a couple of joules of energy.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:35.360]   DE supposedly gave us our origins and by extension of that our morality and meaning, at least
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.880]   according to the intelligentsia, namely, that there really isn't any objective morality
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.560]   or any meaning, except the ones we make for ourselves or the social contract that we enter
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560]   into.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:01.920]   DE, being the mainstay in intellectual thought, also permeated outside of the hard sciences.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.320]   DE didn't just stay put within biology.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.580]   For example, you had social Darwinism where we had people who were justifying the stamping
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:23.340]   out of the "weaker" or "less fit" since that supposedly mirrors what happened to bring
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.380]   about current day mankind.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.820]   But most relevant and directly interconnected with the idea of social Darwinism, DE needs
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:43.880]   to be taken to task since it provided a framework for a scientific validation for racism.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.680]   To begin with, let's start off and define DE according to live science.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.760]   Live science says, and I quote, "The theory of evolution by natural selection first formulated
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.040]   in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.400]   of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life in 1859 is a process by which organisms change
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.760]   over time as a result of changes in inheritable physical or behavioral traits.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.620]   Changes that allow an organism to better adapt to its environment will help it survive and
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.320]   have more offspring."
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   Over millennia, these changes will eventually produce a completely different species.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:46.760]   Now I quoted the entire book title of Charles Darwin's book because what I've noticed
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.200]   is the book entitled "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.680]   of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life" is typically truncated on "The Origin of
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.000]   Species by Charles Darwin" mostly because can you imagine a title called "The Preservation
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:33.420]   of Favored Races" surviving in our culture today?
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:57.640]   It is called Darwinian evolution because Charles Darwin was the author of this thought.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:08.040]   As the definition implies, species develop into different species and over millennia
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.580]   humans are the product of evolved apes.
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.920]   Humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.160]   In this worldview, there is no first man in a distinct sense.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:32.480]   There are gradually formulated beast-men wherein differing races evolved from different creatures.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.200]   And since differing races evolved from different beasts, you could begin to see how easy scientifically
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   validated racism could begin to take shape.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.400]   Disdain and hate are much easier to practice if you believe it to be intellectually proven.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.200]   To put it another way, there is a pool of blob and in that pool of blob over time you
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:07.120]   have complex cellular machinery that develops and over time you have multicellular organisms.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.600]   The tadpole jumped out of the pool and over time it turned into another creature and over
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.720]   enough time we had an ape and over enough time we have humans.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.080]   As I say that, I'm not trying to caricature the theory.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.640]   I don't believe in that.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.680]   Truth claims should stand on their own two legs and insulting an idea without discussing
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.600]   the merits is not something I'm going to engage in.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.760]   That is not something I'm going to do.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.440]   Much of our culture does it, but that is not something that I find favor with.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.120]   If an idea is ridiculous, it should be revealed on its own claims and not swept away by disparaging
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   it.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.760]   I'm only trying to give it to you in a nutshell.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.640]   Ravi Zacharias stated it like this, "It is time plus matter plus chance."
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.920]   It is time plus matter plus chance.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.520]   Let's ask a couple of fair questions and state some fair observations here.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.920]   Natural selection, which is the mechanism for evolution, states that nature will always
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.720]   retain the good mutations and allow the others to pass.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.340]   That's natural selection.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:23.960]   If you have a mutation that is harmful to you, that species will eventually be wiped
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.020]   out.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:32.540]   It is the good mutations that will be allowed to pass by process of natural selection.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:42.120]   Problem is, nobody has ever observed a genuine genetic mutation occurring in the natural
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.200]   environment which was beneficial.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.120]   Nothing goes from disorder to order.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.220]   Everything goes from order to disorder, which in thermodynamics is called entropy.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:04.820]   This should be differentiated with microevolution, which is observable, which has been observed.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:13.720]   And microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.360]   population.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.840]   That should be distinguished from macroevolution.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:30.440]   Microevolution is observed, but for DE to occur, something much more profound and impacted
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.400]   needs to occur than mere microevolution.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.380]   So despite the fact that what I just stated has never been observed, let's just say
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:47.800]   for a moment that I concede macroevolution occurring.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:54.160]   Another fair question would be, what is the probability for random mutations, the beneficial
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.740]   ones, to compile and develop into a brand new species?
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:09.000]   To ask it another way, what is the mathematical probability of DE actually occurring if I
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.320]   give the Darwinian evolutionist all their claims?
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.720]   If I concede their claims to be true, what is the probability of it actually occurring?
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.040]   This is important because if you knew that the likelihood of an event occurring is let's
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:30.040]   say 50/50, then you might be more inclined to believe that an event actually occurred
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:40.120]   as opposed to saying that the probability of that same event occurring is 1 in a trillion.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.160]   Assuming the Darwinian evolutionist's ideal conditions and understanding there are at
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.040]   least 200 integrated and functioning parts in an organism, the probability of success
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:10:01.080]   for each mutation is 1/10^60.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:11.700]   According to mathematician Emil Borel, any odds beyond 1/10^50 should be considered a
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.840]   mathematical impossibility.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:23.680]   So already, for DE to be accepted, I have to accept it despite it never being observed
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:31.480]   in nature and also it being a statistical impossibility.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.680]   I could go on and further lay some challenges to Darwinian evolution, but I think you get
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.560]   the picture.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.280]   If you're interested in further reading, I would recommend Darwin's Black Box by Michael
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:50.960]   Behe, he's a professor over at Lehigh University, Darwin on Trial by Philip E. Johnson, and
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.360]   The Creation Hypothesis by J.P. Moreland.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:02.640]   I do have an undergraduate degree in biological sciences from UCI, and I can tell you I didn't
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   need my undergraduate degree to understand the books that I just recommended.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.680]   It aided in understanding those books, but I don't think looking back that it was required
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   for me to understand those books.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.200]   So today, Darwinian evolution is still the accepted cultural definition of the origins
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:32.600]   of life on earth, and the only real accepted worldview in academia.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:40.320]   Anyone not accepting of this view in academia would be considered a neanderthal.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.880]   As stated earlier, there are many implications if you hold to a DE worldview, but I'll tackle
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.160]   only the few mentioned in the beginning.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.240]   The first is that life has no real meaning.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:06.200]   There really is no objective morality, no real good and bad, no real right and wrong.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:13.320]   There is only the social contract, and social contracts are inherently arbitrary, and they
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:19.200]   differ amongst different people groups over different ranges of time.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.320]   To illustrate this point, let's take a look at some of our genetic cousins according to
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   DE.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.520]   Let's take a look at the lion.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:35.160]   Nobody looks at the lion in disdain because they eat antelopes, they eat zebras, buffaloes,
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.140]   and the like.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.720]   Nobody believes what the lion is doing is wrong.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.000]   If the lion ate another lion, nobody would think it was doing anything wrong.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.860]   You might think it's out of the ordinary, but no one would accuse it of a moral violation.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:04.360]   We feel the same way about monkeys, and some monkeys, unbeknownst to myself at least, some
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.040]   monkeys will actually eat the young of other monkeys.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.440]   Matt Geo published an article called "Chimps Eat Baby Monkey Brains First, A Clue to Human
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   Evolution."
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:23.080]   "Chimps Eat Baby Monkey Brains First, A Clue to Human Evolution."
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.920]   This was on April 11th of 2018.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:33.800]   Live Science also quotes on the same topic the following, and I quote, "Chimpanzees are
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.160]   primarily plant eaters, though they enthusiastically eat animals when they catch them, and monkeys
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160]   are an especially desirable treat.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.480]   But once the snack is in hand, and with so many delicious body parts to choose from,
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.720]   which do the predatory primates eat first?
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.720]   Wonder no longer.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.800]   Scientists have discovered that it all depends on the age of the unfortunate prey.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   Researchers recently filmed chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe National Park excitedly munching
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.120]   on monkeys, hoping to learn more about the chimps' carnivorous eating habits.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.960]   Whenever older monkeys were on the menu, chimps tended to initially harvest the organs, particularly
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.740]   the liver, which is rich in fat, the scientists reported in a new study.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.240]   But if a chimp was lucky enough to catch a youngster, they were almost certain to go
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:34.400]   straight for the tender, savory, and nutrient-packed brain, biting right through the fragile skulls
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:40.960]   and devouring the juvenile monkeys headfirst."
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:49.280]   According to DE, those are our genetic cousins.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:59.040]   This raises my next question, do you think there would be any societal repercussions,
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:13.120]   any wide-ranging ripple effects, from believing in something so inane, inane, I-N-A-N-E?
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:26.480]   And by inane, I mean that these are our actual genetic cousins, according to DE.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:35.560]   Romans 121-125 states the following, "For even though they knew God, they did not honor
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:43.420]   Him as God, or give thanks; but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.960]   heart was darkened.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.840]   Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:16:00.280]   God for an image in the form of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.520]   and crawling creatures.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.920]   Therefore, God gave them over in the lusts of their heart to impurity, so that their
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.040]   bodies would be dishonored among them, for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie,
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:20.400]   and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.840]   Amen."
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:31.520]   Despite this being a statistical impossibility, and never being actually observed in nature,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:38.960]   this theory has been taught in our schools, in our universities, and the vast majority
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.000]   of us accepted it as benign.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.620]   If we go ahead and teach our children that life intrinsically has no meaning on a fundamental
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:17:02.360]   level, and that objective morality does not exist, there is no logical consistency in
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.680]   being outraged by anything that happens in this world.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:17.320]   Who cares about sex trafficking, abortion, broken families, or even racism?
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:24.960]   And then when we marry this with existentialism, when you've taken scientific naturalism,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.880]   and then you marry that with philosophical existentialism to its logical conclusion,
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.640]   the only thing you have left to live for are momentary pleasures.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.240]   And momentary pleasures, by definition, are fleeting.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:48.760]   The moment they fade, you need to look for the next fix, all the while your soul is decaying
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.040]   from the lack of any real substance.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:58.440]   Because make no mistake about it, whether one believes it or not, we are all embodied
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.800]   souls.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:10.840]   My next question is this, on top of defining life as having no intrinsic meaning, have
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:18.000]   there been any other practical outcomes from the world incorporating DE?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.920]   The term "Social Darwinism" was coined not too long after Darwin's origin of species
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.600]   by means of natural selection or the preservation of favorite races in the struggle for life.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:36.160]   This concept was of particular importance to Hitler's war machine in Nazi Germany.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.960]   Nazi propaganda films were quick to use this ideology to promote a "unity of hatred, anyone
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.240]   not of the Aryan race."
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.760]   In All Life is Struggle, a Nazi propaganda film, the film depicted how the disabled needed
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.400]   to be wiped out via forced sterilization.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:08.120]   Much like how children with Down syndrome are systematically aborted, at least in Iceland
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.200]   and now in other parts of the world.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.440]   In All Life is Struggle, that's only one film.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.920]   The German Reich used this concept of Social Darwinism to justify a racism that ended with
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:34.320]   eugenics, this eugenic cleansing as they called it, was their mechanism for genocide.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:45.960]   Upon this road is what led to the extermination, the mass murder of 6 million Jews, maybe more,
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.400]   that accounted for two-thirds of all European Jews at the time.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:20:03.520]   That means if you were a Jew living in Europe at the time, you had a 67% chance of dying.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:10.800]   This theory doesn't seem so benign now, does it?
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.000]   "Wait, we can't blame this on Darwin," you say?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.920]   Let me quote to you Charles Darwin in his book, The Descent of Man.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.120]   The Descent of Man is a follow-up to his book, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.320]   Selection or the Preservation of Favorite Races in the Struggle for Life.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.480]   He says this and I quote, "At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries,
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.160]   the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.040]   the savage races.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.720]   At the same time, the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Shroffhausen has remarked, will
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.440]   no doubt be exterminated.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:56.080]   The break will then be rendered wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:03.040]   state as we may hope, than the Caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:10.280]   at present between the (insert archaic word for a black person here) or Australian and
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:18.200]   the gorilla."
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.520]   At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.280]   of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.760]   At the same time, the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Shroffhausen has remarked, will
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.680]   no doubt be exterminated.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.640]   The break will then be rendered wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:47.920]   state as we may hope, than the Caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:54.840]   at present between the (insert archaic word for a black person here) or Australian and
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   the gorilla."
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:04.200]   The founder of the eugenics movement was Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.280]   Francis Galton and Charles Darwin loved and supported each other dearly.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:18.400]   Let me quote to you Francis Galton directly from his book, Inquiries into the Human Faculty
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   and its Development.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:26.120]   He says, "We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.200]   is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.540]   of man, takes cognizance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:44.200]   to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:51.860]   the less suitable than the otherwise would have had."
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:58.480]   You really want to talk about evil lunacy?
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.920]   Don't for a second think that Darwin and his cousin were the only villains during this
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.500]   time.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:17.880]   As inane as all of this sounds, this is what drove the entire culture.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:27.660]   I want to quote to you an article written by Angela Saini and the Guardian, October
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:37.520]   3rd, 2019, "Francis Galton is rightly criticized for advancing this immoral, racist non-science,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.960]   but remember, his ideas were mainstream.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.560]   We tend to associate eugenics with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, but it was in fact developed
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.720]   in London.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.080]   Its founder was Francis Galton, who established a laboratory at UCL in 1904.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.160]   Already some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton Lecture
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.160]   Theater.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:03.920]   Galton's seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.360]   productive people.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.680]   The scientists, in its thrall, claimed this could be achieved by controlling reproduction,
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.860]   policing borders to prevent certain types of immigrants, and locking away undesirables,
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.800]   including disabled people.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.040]   This was an age in which it was not unusual for scientists to believe that humans were
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.880]   divided into different species, some more advanced than others.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.080]   Biologists proclaimed that it would be better for society if disabled and mentally feeble
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.000]   people hadn't been born.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.240]   Eugenics made it into government policy.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.460]   The Mental Deficiency Act of 1913 institutionally separated those whom the state considered
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:51.880]   mentally feeble or morally defective from the rest of society, effectively preventing
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   them from having children."
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   But Darwin's theory didn't just stay in the Western world and in Europe, it came to the
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   US as well.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:15.400]   I want to give a huge shout out to the guys over at the Just Thinking Podcast for unearthing
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.020]   this article.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.040]   This is a long quote, but stay with me here.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.300]   Nat Geo had an article entitled, "There's no scientific basis for race.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.960]   It's a made-up label.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.200]   There's no scientific basis for race.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.640]   It's a made-up label."
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.600]   This was published on March 12th of 2018.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.440]   Elizabeth Colbert writes, and I quote, "In the first half of the 19th century, one of
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.320]   America's most prominent scientists was a doctor named Samuel Morton.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.680]   Morton lived in Philadelphia and he collected skulls.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.080]   He wasn't choosy about his suppliers.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.760]   He accepted skulls scavenged from battlefields and snatched from catacombs.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.360]   One of his most famous craniums belonged to an Irishman who had been sent as a convict
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.380]   to Tasmania and ultimately hanged for killing and eating other convicts.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.060]   With each skull, Morton performed the same procedure.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.920]   He stuffed it with pepper seeds.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:16.280]   Later he switched to lead shot, which he then decanted to ascertain the volume of the brain
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.280]   case.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.520]   Morton believed that people could be divided into five races and that these represented
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   separate acts of creation.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:28.320]   The races had distinct characters, which correspond to their place in a divinely determined hierarchy.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.880]   Morton's craniometry showed he claimed that whites or Caucasians were the most intelligent
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   of the races.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.760]   East Asians, Morton used the term Mongolian, though indigenous and susceptible of cultivation
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.640]   were one step down.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.120]   Next came Southeast Asians, followed by Native Americans.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.000]   Blacks or Ethiopians were at the bottom.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.360]   In the decades before the Civil War, Morton's ideas were quickly taken up by the defenders
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.800]   of slavery.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.240]   He had a lot of influence, particularly in the South, says Paul Wolfe Mitchell, an anthropologist
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.440]   at the University of Pennsylvania, who is showing me the skull collection now housed
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.040]   at the Penn Museum.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.320]   We're standing over the brain case of a particularly large headed Dutchman who helped inflate Morton's
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.040]   estimate of Caucasian capacities.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:16.600]   When Morton died in 1851, the Charleston Medical Journal in South Carolina praised him for
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:24.440]   giving to the, insert archaic word for black person, his true position as an inferior race.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:30.160]   Today, Morton is known as the father of scientific racism.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.760]   So many of the horrors of the past few centuries can be traced to the idea that one race is
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.080]   inferior to another, that a tour of his collection is a haunting experience.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.520]   To an uncomfortable degree, we still live with Morton's legacy.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.000]   Political distinctions continue to shape our politics, our neighborhoods, and our sense
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.480]   of self."
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.920]   So this is the case.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.680]   Even though what science actually has to tell us about race is just the opposite of what
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.520]   Morton contended.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.840]   Wow.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.800]   Wow.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.760]   Let me quote to you another portion from the same article.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.200]   Morton thought he'd identified immutable and inherited differences among people.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.040]   But at the time he was working, shortly before Charles Doran put forth his theory of evolution
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   and long before the discovery of DNA, scientists had no idea how traits were passed on.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.000]   Researchers who have since looked at people at the genetic level now say that the whole
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.720]   category of race is misconceived.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:45.160]   Indeed, when scientists set out to assemble the first complete human genome, which was
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   a composite of several individuals, they deliberately gathered samples from people who self-identified
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.280]   as members of different races.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:59.960]   In June of 2000, when the results were announced at a White House ceremony, Craig Venter, a
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:14.680]   pioneer of DNA sequencing, observed, "The concept of race has no genetic or scientific
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.360]   basis.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:22.080]   The grotesque institution of slavery was in part able to endure for as long as it did
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:33.680]   because of validation it received from the scientific community and public consensus."
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:44.240]   Illegitimate science spills over, infiltrates an entire generation.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.360]   That is what happened.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.680]   Are vestiges of it still alive today?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.900]   I want to quote to you Margaret Sanger.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.560]   She is the founder of Planned Parenthood.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.760]   This isn't meant to be a political hit.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.280]   I'm giving you facts.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:11.640]   I am quoting to you Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:22.920]   "We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the (insert archaic word for
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:31.840]   black person here) population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:42.060]   if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:57.400]   We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the black population, and the
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:04.480]   minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.720]   more rebellious members.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:20.400]   Did you know that the founder of Planned Parenthood was a frequent speaker for the KKK?
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.380]   Did you know that?
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:32.720]   Race is a synthetic, man-made social construct.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.960]   I'm not saying there is no such thing as people groups.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.440]   I'm talking about race.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:49.280]   I'm talking about the amount of melanin, or lack thereof.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:54.520]   What does the Bible say about race?
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:32:01.400]   I want to quote to you Paul as he is speaking to a group of amateur philosophers on Mars
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400]   Hill.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:11.880]   Acts 17, 22-28 says this, "So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, 'Men
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:17.240]   of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:22.440]   For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.760]   an altar with this inscription, 'To an unknown God.'
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.120]   Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.520]   The God who made the world and all things in it, since he is the Lord of heaven and
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.040]   earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:46.160]   Nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything, since he himself gives
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.820]   to all people life and breath in all things.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:33:02.760]   And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.680]   determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, that they would seek
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:14.320]   God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.840]   of us.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:23.480]   For in him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, for
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:29.720]   we also are his children."
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:37.760]   I'm not saying that everyone who believes in the theory of evolution is a racist.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   What I am saying, though, is that DE does indeed validate and has validated the concept
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.960]   of racism.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:56.080]   Moreover, racism was espoused by the very author of this theory and its adherents followed
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.720]   that theory to its logical conclusion, which is seeing other races as inferior and ultimately
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:09.600]   justifying heinous and unspeakable acts based on that same theory.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:17.240]   So if you claim that others are anti-intellectual for not believing in evolution, there are
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.760]   two things you have to contend with.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.900]   You have to contend with the lack of merits of the claims of the argument.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:30.680]   Number two, you have to admit that the theory you hold to is intrinsically racist.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:36.440]   Those are two honest intellectual extensions of DE.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:44.400]   You could deny those extensions, but your denial does not change reality.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.040]   As we look back upon history and as we have the luxury of seeing how these ideas played
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:56.800]   out and what the consequences were, we should pause for a moment and understand that ideas
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   do indeed have consequences.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.320]   I said in the previous episode, all of life corresponds to truth.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:10.420]   The lack of any truth convictions about abstract principles of life matters immensely.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:15.520]   To say the same thing yet another way, theology is immensely practical.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:21.200]   If your theology posits that humans descended from apes, or your philosophy, or your worldview,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.400]   or whatever else you want to call it, by extension, there is going to be wiggle room for these
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.800]   other abhorrent atrocities.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.480]   If you don't know who Richard Weaver is, he wrote a book called Ideas Have Consequences,
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.120]   and I'm purposely alluding to that book every time I bring up that term.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:43.760]   I'm thankful for the book because it's important that we, like I said earlier, take to task
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:50.880]   these unproven fads that were passed up as intellectual prowess because they have wreaked
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:58.640]   havoc on society while the intelligentsia themselves typically have escaped via a golden
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   parachute.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:08.660]   After all, what other unproven fads that the intelligentsia have decreed do we just accept
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.880]   like sheep?
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:19.960]   No doubt Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and his idea of the Superman or the Ubermensch
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:28.520]   contributed to the decaying moral tender that helped spur the acceptance of the Nazi Holocaust.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.880]   So you have science at the time espousing that we evolved from apes and that some races
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   are more superior than others.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:43.440]   Then you have philosophers at the time prescribing the idea of a Superman, and in case you don't
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:51.840]   know what I'm referring to, Britannica states in relation to Superman, and I'm not talking
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.200]   about the comic book, I'm talking about the philosophy, Superman or in German, Ubermensch
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:05.480]   in philosophy is the superior man who justifies the existence of the human race.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:13.600]   Superman is a term significantly used by Friedrich Nietzsche, particularly in Also Spoke Zarathustra,
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:18.840]   although it had been employed by J. W. von Goethe and others.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.680]   This superior man would not be a product of long evolution, rather, he would emerge when
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:30.200]   any man with superior potential completely masters himself and strikes off conventional
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:37.380]   Christian herd morality to create his own values, which are completely rooted in life
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.480]   on this earth.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:46.240]   This is the same philosopher who wrote in his book On the Genealogy of Morals, On the
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:54.800]   Genealogy of Morals, how the greatest impediment to human progress in history were the Jews
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.740]   and the Jew Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:03.360]   In the final section of that same book, Nietzsche goes on to describe how there's a certain
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:12.000]   satisfaction that is derived from inflicting pain on another, and that cruelty goes hand
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.620]   in hand with festivities.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:21.600]   He goes on to explain that although that might sound like a bitter pill for the civilized
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:28.640]   to swallow, it is only because the civilized are entrenched in slave morality, and that
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:36.920]   slave morality was brought upon by the priestly Jews and the Jew Jesus who must be thrown
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.800]   off.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.920]   Going back to Richard Weaver's book, Ideas Have Consequences, because these were the
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:52.000]   ideas right before World War II, he wrote this book, Ideas Have Consequences, after
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:03.240]   World War II in order to describe how the world could have arrived at such dire circumstances.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:09.840]   I know there are some of you who aren't history buffs, so I'm going to give you a quick summary
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.140]   of World War II.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:20.320]   World War II, also known as the Second World War, was a war fought from 1939 to 1945 in
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.080]   Europe and during much of the 1930s and 40s in Asia.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:29.280]   The war in Europe began in earnest on September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Nazi
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.680]   Germany and concluded on September 2, 1945, with the official surrender of the last Axis
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.400]   nation, Japan.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.520]   However, in Asia, the war began earlier with the Japanese interventions in China, and in
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.900]   Europe, the war ended earlier with the unconditional surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:52.280]   The conflict spilled over into Africa, included a handful of incidents in the Americas, and
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.400]   a series of major naval battles.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:40:00.920]   It was the largest armed conflict in history, spanning the entire world and involving more
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:07.080]   countries than any other war, as well as introducing powerful new weapons, culminating the first
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.280]   use of nuclear weapons.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.880]   However, despite the name, not all countries of the world were involved.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:20.000]   Some through neutrality, such as the Irish, supplied some important secret information
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   to the Allies.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.700]   D-Day's date was decided on the basis of the incoming Atlantic weather information
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:31.680]   supplied from Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland, others through strategic insignificance.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:37.520]   The war ravaged civilians more severely than any previous conflict and served as a backdrop
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:44.960]   for genocidal killings by Nazi Germany, as well as several other mass slaughters of civilians,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:52.040]   which, although not technically genocidal, were significant.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.600]   These included the massacre of millions of Chinese and Korean nationals by Japan, internal
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.800]   mass killings in the Soviet Union, and the bombing of civilian targets in German and
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:08.280]   Japanese cities by the Allies, in total, World War II produced about 50 million deaths, more
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.180]   than any other war to date.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:20.880]   I took that from a history website, just to give you a summary of World War II.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.400]   Right after that, that is the backdrop of "Ideas Have Consequences."
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:31.760]   Richard Weaver states in his book, "When 'Ideas Have Consequences' was published
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.500]   in 1948, it met a response far beyond anything anticipated by the author.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:42.080]   The book was written in the period immediately following the Second World War, and it was,
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.640]   in a way, a reaction to that war, to its immense destructiveness, to the strain it placed upon
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:55.160]   ethical principles, and to the tensions it left in the place of the peace and order that
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.920]   were professedly sought."
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.680]   Richard Weaver goes on to state, "In considering the world to which these matters are addressed,
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.040]   I have been chiefly impressed by the difficulty of getting certain initial facts admitted.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:17.480]   This difficulty is due in part to the widely prevailing Whig Theory of History, with its
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:22.160]   belief that the most advanced point in time represents the point of highest development,
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.080]   aided, no doubt, by theories of evolution which suggest to the uncritical a kind of
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.320]   necessary passage from simple to complex.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.880]   Yet the real trouble is found to lie deeper than this.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.640]   It is the appalling problem, when one comes to actual cases, of getting men to distinguish
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.320]   between better and worse.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:46.240]   Are people today provided with a sufficiently rational scale of values to attach these predicates
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.200]   with intelligence?
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.800]   There is ground for declaring that modern man has become a moral idiot.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.880]   So few are those who care to examine their lives, or to accept the rebuke which comes
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.920]   of admitting that our present state may be a fallen state, that one questions whether
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.360]   people now understand what is meant by the superiority of an ideal.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.760]   One might expect abstract reasoning to be lost upon them.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:20.000]   But what is he to think when attestations of the most concrete kind are set before them
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.960]   and they are still powerless to mark a difference or to draw a lesson?
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.800]   For four centuries every man has been not only his own priest, but his own professor
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:36.440]   of ethics, and the consequence is an anarchy which threatens even that minimum consensus
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:44.080]   of value necessary to the political state.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:53.120]   Do you know what this parallels so acutely?
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:44:01.480]   In the book of Judges, we see what happens when in man's heart God is taken off his throne.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:10.360]   Nobody is able to discern and apply what God has said and man is left to his own devices.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:21.720]   And all that is left is murder and destruction that leads to anarchy and rubble.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:42.400]   Judges 21-25 states, "In those days there was no king in Israel.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:48.080]   Everyone did what was right in his own eyes."
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:57.400]   Do you just do what is right in your own eyes?
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:02.300]   Let me posit to you another theory.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:13.560]   This other theory is that we were all made in the image of God and that all human beings
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.840]   have the same ancestor.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:22.440]   In this worldview, no matter the people, group, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexuality, political
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:31.720]   affiliation or even ideology, we are all genetic brothers and sisters.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:43.440]   And based on that alone, we afford one another a level of human dignity that corresponds
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:51.760]   to the Creator who made each and every one of us.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   That is what I believe in.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:04.320]   And if we're going to talk about this issue in a dispassionate, on an intellectually and
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:17.560]   logically consistent manner, then we are going to have to face some implications that perhaps
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.720]   you and I do not like.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:27.360]   And if you're listening to this and you are a Christian, and there is nothing I said that
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.200]   is controversial, this is what I want to say to you.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:38.280]   This theory was espoused by the intelligentsia.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:47.600]   What other theories espoused by today's intelligentsia do you just blindly accept as true?
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:56.200]   That you yourself do not have a justification for, nor can you really articulate, but you
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.280]   accept it and ridicule others who do not believe it?
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.840]   The intelligentsia do not have a great history for truth-telling.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.560]   And I'm going to devote another episode to just that.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:20.840]   But for now, I wanted to talk about Darwinian evolution, the scientific validation for racism,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:27.080]   and the vestiges it has left on us today.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.040]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:34.200]   I will continue to try and make the journey worth it.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:48:02.040]   To him, the honor, glory, and eternal demeanor, James Hall.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:09.760]   [MUSIC]
