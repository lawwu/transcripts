[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   Some people discourage questions.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.200]   They think that it's annoying.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.240]   And I think it's great.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.940]   I love when people ask me questions.
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.040]   I think there's sometimes a stigma in companies where the people that ask
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.440]   the questions don't know anything.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.600]   I think the opposite.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.860]   As a matter of fact, the CEO of Wealthfront became the CEO because
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.040]   he asked such tough questions.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.060]   Every tech company typically has a weekly all hands, and there's always one or two
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.560]   engineers who ask really annoying questions.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.760]   And they're annoying because they hit the raw nerve.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.300]   There's usually an issue with every decision that a management team makes.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.540]   And there's always one or two people who know how to find it.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.560]   And David Fortunato was the guy who always found the raw nerve.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.000]   And after a year of taking these questions, I made him the CTO.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.880]   at 25 and he's now our CEO and he's a much better CEO than I ever was.
