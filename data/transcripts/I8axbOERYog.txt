[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   Obviously, you can earn hotel points when you're staying in hotel rooms.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.500]   The only hack here would be if you want to really try to aggregate points in one place.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.840]   So for example, when my wife and I are traveling, I earn all the Marriott and Hyatt points.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.940]   She earns all the Hilton points.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.680]   Something that works pretty well is you could book a room in whoever's name earns the points,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.020]   put in the notes, the other person is checking in, and usually it's no problem
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.020]   for the other person to check in and keep the other person on the reservation.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.560]   So if I were going to stay at a Hilton without my wife, I would probably still book it in her name
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.540]   and have a note that says my husband will be checking in before me
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.540]   so that we could just continue to both use her status and earn points there.
