[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.380]   And there are certain places and services that you can use
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.240]   to report rent and utility payments to your report.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.860]   They're not automatically included.

[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.980]   There are also debit cards that will start reporting to credit bureaus as you use them.

[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.580]   that lowers your utilization and can have an impact.
