[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's interesting, he never himself drove a car.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Can you believe that the man who had more influence on the American car culture,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   probably even than Henry Ford, himself was always driven.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   He was a chauffeur.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   In fact, he was so busy that Carroll talks about him as having two limousines
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   behind each other, and he would have a secretary in one,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and he would be dealing with business and writing letters and things like this.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And then she would have all she could do.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   They would pull off to the side of the road.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   She would get out of his car.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   The car that was following would discharge the secretary in that car.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   They would switch places, and the fresh secretary would get in the back seat,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Moses, and they would continue to work.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And the first secretary would go to type up whatever she had to do.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   He worked all the time.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   He really didn't have much of a private life.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   There are not many people like Robert Moses.
