[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   Is there a type of travel you think is necessary for points to be worth it?
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.040]   I think it does lean more towards aspirational business and like first
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.640]   class type of trips are just like more expensive trips for economy stuff.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.600]   I still pay out of pocket generally because the value is not there or I
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.040]   get okay value, like maybe 1.5 to 2 cents per point, but it's not like
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.040]   the astronomical 10 cents per point.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.740]   So for me, a lot of it is like, how do I, as a P get the VIP experience
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.680]   and unlock this whole thing that I didn't think I could do, like growing
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.760]   up, like pretty lower middle class.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.840]   I never thought I'd be able to fly business, let alone first.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920]   So the fact that I can actually like, even if it's just for a few hours, see
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.700]   what it's like to be on the other side and experience that and see these other
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.400]   people who are dropping 20 K on these flights.
