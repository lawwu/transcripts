[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   Hi, this is Jeremy Howard from Answer.ai with a quick explanation of how to become more
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.760]   productive in Discord.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.520]   I kind of live my life in Discord nowadays.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:21.840]   It's one of the most productive chat applications I've worked in over the last 30-plus years.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.560]   Probably the best I've ever used was like 35 years ago, a usernet client called RN,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.400]   but Discord maybe is my second most productive.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.680]   I have a lot of servers in Discord, as you can see, because kind of most AI happens in
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.580]   Discord nowadays.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.800]   So how do I manage this efficiently?
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600]   It's basically all about keyboard shortcuts.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.640]   What I want to do each day is read the channels that I actually care about and ensure that
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.560]   if somebody needs my attention that they get it.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.720]   To read the channels that I care about, I can see on my screen that the ones marked
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.600]   with little blobs here are the ones that have unread messages.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.560]   I don't want to miss any messages from the channels I care about, so I'm going to read
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.560]   all of them.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.040]   So to make sure I just read all of them, I start at the very top and I hit Option + Shift
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.880]   + Down, or I guess on a Windows it would be Alt + Shift + Down, and it takes me directly,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.280]   as you can see, to my next unread.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.240]   Read that, Alt + Shift + Down or Option + Shift + Down, next unread, Option + Shift + Down,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560]   next unread, and I'll just keep doing this.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.320]   And you'll see it even jumps into threads as well, so it's showing these unread stuff
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320]   inside threads.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.200]   So I really make sure that I don't miss anything.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.920]   Now I'm at the end of this channel.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.800]   Actually one thing, server, one thing I will mention is it's really important then to make
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.940]   sure that you don't see unread stuff in things you don't care about.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.240]   So here's an example of something I don't care about, bot messages.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240]   So I've already gone in here and said Mute Channel.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.400]   To make sure I don't even see it, actually, I will go ahead and say Hide Muted Channels.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.800]   So now I don't even see it at all.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.760]   The other thing is that some servers have administrators who use @Everyone or @Here
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.760]   too often.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:25.400]   So if that's the case, you can always just say Notification Settings, sorry, I go Notification
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.720]   Settings, I'm sorry, for the server, and you can say Suppress @Everyone and @Here, and
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.000]   also make sure it's set to only @Mentions.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.640]   That way you'll only get notified of stuff which is specifically sent to you.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.840]   OK, so we've finished this server's channel, so if I press Option + Shift + Down again,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.300]   it's now gone to the next server, which in this case is the HTMX server.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.320]   And so I continue on, reading all of these, and you can see as I do each one, it gets
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   marked as red.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.360]   OK, and I've finished that server, one more, and we're on to the next one.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.880]   OK, so that's the key thing to know, is make sure that you mute any servers that you don't
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.880]   really need to know about.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.240]   Also, you can mute categories and channels, so in fact, for example, I'm not in any study
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.400]   groups for Fast.ai, so I just went ahead and muted the whole category.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.960]   And then when you create messages, it's important to know that if you hit Shift + Enter, it
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.980]   doesn't send it, and that's the key thing to adding stuff like Python code.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.960]   So just put back triple backticks, Python, triple backticks, and hit Shift + Enter after
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.920]   each line, and then when you're done, hit Enter.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.720]   And then the other thing that's useful to know about is that you can then hit this little
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.800]   button up here to create a thread and give it a message.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.200]   And now we've got a thread going, that's a really good way to make sure that you can
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.600]   have a long conversation without getting confused.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.800]   Oh, and if you're worried why this is Jeremy with a U, this is actually a channel I share
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.360]   with my daughter, who told me that on Discord, when talking to her, it's necessary to always
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.800]   not have any Es in my name or messages.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   So everything has to be U.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.720]   Oh, I should have changed this to message U. Oh well, sorry Claire.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.800]   So, other than that problem with too many Es, that's my quick introduction to being
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.220]   more productive with Discord.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.720]   And this is my first little experiment of doing fast, short little videos about small
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   things, so let me know if you find this helpful.
