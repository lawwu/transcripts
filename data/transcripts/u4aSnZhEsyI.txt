[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   My mom never gave me a single recipe, ever.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.560]   I wish she did sometimes, right?
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.840]   If you have a recipe that you want from your mom
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.800]   or your aunt or your uncle,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.280]   I think what you find more often than not,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.400]   what I'm guilty of and I'm sure everyone else is,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.240]   hey, text your mom,
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.640]   hey, can you tell me how you make that dish?
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000]   Can you give me like specifics?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.640]   I think probably what would be more impactful
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.880]   and I don't wanna seem cheesy or hokey is like,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.720]   get on a flight, spend a long weekend,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.520]   and make it with them.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.720]   That's what I think is missing in a lot of these things
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.920]   is like the recipe can actually prevent you
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.080]   from actually learning actually
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.200]   how to actually make it right.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.120]   For example, I've lived in Los Angeles for two years
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.920]   and I don't know the names of any of the fucking highways
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.800]   because all I do is follow GPS, right?
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.840]   But I understand that most people's cooking
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.120]   is like car GPS for them.
