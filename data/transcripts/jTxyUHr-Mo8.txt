[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   The way that bipolar disorder can present
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.760]   can vary tremendously between individuals.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.880]   One person might go from very high highs
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.880]   that last seven days or more to very low lows,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.340]   bouts of major depression that can last two weeks or more.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.960]   Other people are rapid cycling by way of three days manic,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.680]   three days normal, three days manic,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.760]   and then dropping into three days depression.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.220]   So you want to erase that picture in your mind
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220]   that manic bipolar disorder is this sine wave,
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.200]   this cycling up and down between mania and depression.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.120]   It can take a lot of different forms.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.040]   This is a serious challenge for the psychiatrist
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.000]   to diagnose people because of that fact
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   that they're only getting a snapshot of the person
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.460]   unless they've known them for some time
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.320]   and are working with them for some time.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.200]   But this is also especially important for those of you
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.360]   that either have bipolar depression
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.600]   or suspect that you might,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.280]   or that know someone with bipolar depression
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.800]   or suspect somebody might have bipolar depression,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.440]   AKA bipolar disorder.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.340]   the way that bipolar disorder can.
