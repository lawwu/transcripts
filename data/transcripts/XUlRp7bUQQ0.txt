[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   So many people that I told I was coming to chat with you associate you with hustle.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.360]   What are they getting wrong when they make that assumption?
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.200]   The nuances of it, right? Like, yes, I believe in work ethic. I, you know, I think it's a variable.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.280]   But I don't think it's as, you know, it's, it kind of reminds me of what's just kind of going
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.240]   on in the world, right? We're so into headline reading. I think there was a couple of viral
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.840]   posts on Medium written about me on hustle porn and that kind of like cemented a point of view
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.560]   that even the writer of that article three years later DM me to apologize because he spoke to the
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.080]   agenda he had at hand and realized he was making certain variables convenient to the story he was
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.600]   trying to tell. And I really appreciated that by the way. I think that takes a lot of
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   humility and courage. And, and honestly, I, I, I really do love the idea of like
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.280]   understanding that work ethic is a variable, but there's so many other variables. Like, for example,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.440]   from the first book I wrote, Crush It!, when I wrote it in 2008 and came out in '09,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.640]   in that exact book, there's like, hey, if you work nine to five and you make $48,000 a year,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.280]   you've won if you're thrilled, if you live within your means and you're super happy.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.560]   And so I think, you know, what people get wrong is, you know, I'm excited and I enjoy what I do
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.840]   and I put in hours towards it, but, you know, it doesn't define me. I, I, I'm completely utterly
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.600]   detached from like financial success, from notoriety. I just love my game. Like, you know,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.560]   the people that know me best know the same vigor I talk about, like, hey, you can have a career that
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.320]   you love. I bring that same vigor to 6 a.m. on a Saturday to go garage sailing because I love it,
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.760]   or competing in basketball or pickleball, or, you know, or watching a Jets game. I think
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.000]   what they get wrong is, unlike a lot of people who don't even use that word or even deploy that
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.920]   energy, I have tons of friends who are seemingly calm, speak all the right speak for acceptance,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.560]   but are absolutely incredibly overly driven by money, by fame, and are detached to that. And,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920]   and I think that's why there's a lot of anxiety in the world. And so I think, you know, I think
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.640]   the nuances of how I think about it, plus I also spoke about that concept during an incredibly
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.760]   down market in the economy when the internet was hitting an incredible inflection point in 2008,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.680]   9, 10. So, you know, I think, I think just the nuance of it, the word, when I use the word
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.000]   hustle in 2008, 9, 10, the, the intent is like, hey, there's opportunity and you can go get it.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.320]   I'm thrilled to change that word to tenacity or grit or work ethic. So I think, I think the
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.560]   semantics of it all. And, and I am a communicator that I, I'm incredibly self-aware that the way I
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   communicate with the excitement level, with the, the energy, with the Jersey chat of it, you know,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   I, I'm very aware and under, and genuinely compassionate and understanding to why people
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   may take the extreme take. And I also don't, I don't have the audacity. I deploy enormous humility
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.760]   when I'm about to say what I'm saying. I would never expect someone to spend five hours to double
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.280]   click into it and actually understand what I'm about and what I'm saying. And so, you know,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.760]   I guess at the end of the day, what are they missing? They're not missing anything. If they're
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.600]   just doing a drive by and reading a headline, if they've spent two or three hours on me through
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.880]   content or interaction or people that really know me, I doubt they'd be missing anything.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.400]   Cause I think they would contextualize it. Yeah. Do you think that work ethic,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.880]   you have that grit, that tenacity is something that can be taught or learned,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.120]   or is it just something that's part of your DNA? I think it's a combination of both. I think,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.440]   I think it's clearly in people's DNA. You know, there's, there's many people that
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.880]   are either born with too little or too much that deploy it immediately to quote unquote,
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.280]   prove something or, or, or see an opportunity, especially for immigrants. You know, it's like
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.000]   so easy for me to go at it. My, my, I was born in the Soviet union. My parents lived their entire
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.920]   childhood and, you know, into their early twenties there. So I lived in a household that really
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.200]   understood like shit, man, like America's pretty epic. Like this is pretty cool. Like you don't go
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.600]   to jail for trying to make a better life for yourself in entrepreneurship. So it was just,
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.640]   you know, it was very easy for me on the flip side. I've seen a lot of people be affected by
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.840]   the osmosis of work ethic. You know, it's, it's kind of like what's going on with me in the gym.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.280]   Like I, it became so not natural as natural as it comes to me to sell lemonade or sports cards or
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.800]   run businesses or be nice to people. It comes equally not natural to me to work in the gym,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.760]   but you know, we've known each other a long time, somewhere around 38, I decided to put in the work
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.520]   because I wanted to live longer and just thought it would be better. And, you know, through osmosis
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.440]   practice, like I'm now someone who goes to the gym. I still don't love it, which is why I really
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.960]   do talk about how important passion is to actually get to that like state where like, it's so easy
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.640]   because you love it so much. You know, I really do wish for everyone that the job they had was
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.320]   similar to their favorite hobby. For everybody right now who's listening, they can take a step
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.280]   back and whether it's skiing or cooking or playing video games or sailing or garage sailing or
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.120]   watching movies or what have you, if they could do that 24 seven and sustain their life, a lot
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.880]   of people would be happier and would enjoy that. But on the flip side for a lot of us, just like
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.920]   me for the gym, you know, sometimes you have to put in that work. If you want to accomplish
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.560]   something that you think is good to me, I'm actually very focused on people living within
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.440]   their means versus creating, you know, frameworks that require them to work harder to make more
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.840]   money to live within the means that they think they need to live in. Like, I don't think you
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.160]   need a BMW. I don't think you need a six bedroom house. And I think that is where that conversation
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   gets interesting. But, you know, at the end of the day, I think it is something that can be taught,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.880]   but I don't think it's something that can be taught in this scenario. I've gotten better
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.800]   at basketball. Even the last year I put in more work. I'm not an NBA player. So I think there is
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.360]   a level of DNA that caps out everyone in every genre, but I think the capacity to get better in
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.840]   everything is quite high. Like I can't sing for a lick. I have a feeling if I got a voice coach
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.640]   and really put in the work and like worked on it for a decade, like I think I would be better at
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.520]   karaoke than I am now. And so that's interesting to me, the things you can control versus the
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.680]   things that you can't. So I'm guessing you don't want to sing, which is why you haven't done that,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.920]   but you did want to, you did want to build. So I have a new song out with Snoop. Everyone go
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.520]   check out. This is not a joke. Go check out on Spotify. Please take a step back.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.080]   Snoop Dogg and Gary Vee. 17 year old me is still freaking the fuck out.
