[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.440]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.080]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.400]   Today, we're talking about the feeling you get
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.600]   when you're in over your head.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.120]   And I'm curious, you guys,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.740]   have you ever taken on like a new responsibility,
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.240]   a new team, or maybe someone left
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.120]   and you absorbed their role
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.920]   and you just felt immediately like a fish out of water?
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.640]   Like what happened to you?
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920]   How did you deal with it?
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.360]   And then what did you learn from your experience?
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.280]   - You wanna go first, Troy?
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.360]   - No, I think you should start this one off.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.580]   - Okay, I'm happy to.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.320]   I've definitely been in experiences
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.440]   where I've moved up a level
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.280]   or my scope has changed
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.640]   and expectations have changed.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.640]   I think though the experience that most reflected
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.400]   a sense of being really in over my head
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.280]   was when I started my own agency.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.720]   And I started it with a couple of colleagues
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.440]   and there was a litany of things
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.260]   that I had never done before.
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.720]   I had been a copywriter and a freelancer at times
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.160]   for at that point, almost more than 20 years.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.000]   And so I'd worked at agencies.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.880]   I worked in-house at large enterprises.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.520]   I'd been an individual contributor.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.240]   I'd been a manager.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.000]   I'd been a director and a manager of managers.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I'd been in part of the hiring and firing processes.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.960]   But when you start your own business,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.760]   and even though I had been a freelancer,
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   I was more of like an individual contributor freelancer.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.400]   And when I engaged with businesses,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   it was on a, I gave them my social security number,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.640]   not my employer identification number,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.720]   which is different, your EID.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.200]   So when I started an agency,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.360]   number one, I had to set up an LLC,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.960]   which was completely new for me.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.840]   And my mom, who's an accountant,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.380]   actually helped me out with that.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.600]   And she knew the ins and outs.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.480]   She's like, well, you just contact this company
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.160]   and they're in, I'm in California.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.120]   They're in Sacramento, which is the capital.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.480]   And this is where you give them the information.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.040]   They submit it, they walk the form over.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.640]   So, but that was a bit of a hurdle,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   just understanding, not just getting the LLC information
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.160]   because I needed to then give it back to my first client.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280]   And I would say, that's where I really felt
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.200]   like I was over my head,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.540]   where I had gotten engagement at Uber
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.300]   that was working for one of their sort of sub businesses
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.940]   called Uber for Business.
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.580]   And I got an opportunity to start an agency
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.780]   because of a unique project that came about.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.220]   But I had to negotiate a rate.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.140]   So the scope of the project was fairly large.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.060]   It was refreshing their website.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.540]   They were pivoting from a freemium to a premium model.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.900]   They wanted a new website.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.240]   They wanted new branding, a new sort of brand narrative.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.920]   They wanted to do focus groups on the work.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.520]   So that by the time it went to market,
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.920]   it had been somewhat tested.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.960]   They wanted a lot of stuff that I had been part of teams
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.680]   that had led projects of this type
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.040]   and they had been successful.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.400]   So I felt like, well, I knew enough
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   that I could feel confident
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.880]   about moving forward in that direction,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.320]   but negotiating a rate and it was a blended rate, right?
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   So a rate for copywriting, for design, for production,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   for development, for focus group moderation, for analysis,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.680]   for at some point along the line,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.280]   once we had been hired for media planning.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   We also did brand strategy and brand narrative.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.940]   All of this stuff, which I had kind of sort of done
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.620]   some part of over the course of my 20-year career,
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.140]   but I never led.
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.960]   And when you're, you know,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.700]   I finally was able to recruit a couple of colleagues,
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.980]   really talented people on the design side
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.300]   that I worked with as partners,
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.740]   but I was there negotiating the rate
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.620]   to get them in the door.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.020]   Meaning, what was the blended rate gonna be?
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.260]   Was it $400 an hour?
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.460]   Was it $200 an hour?
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.340]   Now, mind you, I'd never hired myself out as a freelancer
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.020]   for more than 80 or $90 an hour at the time.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.140]   So it was a huge jump.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.420]   And sort of just the process
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.880]   of figuring out how to do that required a lot of,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.540]   I did a lot of research, frankly.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.780]   I talked to people.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.060]   I read articles and books about what to do
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.580]   when you're running a digital marketing agency.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.700]   And so I ended up negotiating this blended rate.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.780]   And then I had to come up with a,
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.660]   I had to sign an MSA, a master services agreement,
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.320]   master service agreement with Uber.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.540]   And so that involved having the LLC and having insurance,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.540]   which I had to get, business insurance.
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.660]   It was just a lot of things that I had never done before.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.060]   And I felt like, and I was really stressed out about it,
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.980]   but it was always, it was such an exciting moment,
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.300]   I think, at the beginning for me,
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.140]   because it was all potential.
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.100]   Like, I just said yes to everything and I dove into it.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.820]   But if I sit back and think about it,
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.300]   I was way over my head.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.820]   I had no idea what I, well, I had never done it before.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.900]   And it's not that I had no idea what to do,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.260]   but I think when you're in that position
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.840]   where you have an opportunity like that,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.460]   and you're going for it, you need to be flexible.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.980]   In order to land on a rate that Uber could agree with,
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.460]   I had to do a lot of negotiations.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.340]   There were weeks of negotiating back and forth
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.500]   with the primary stakeholder on the Uber side.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.440]   And you have to be adaptable
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.820]   'cause you're working with different people.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.420]   There's different, there's like,
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.740]   stakeholders that have input, but not the decision.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.300]   And it's just a lot of that being flexible
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.380]   in the moment to the conditions that you're presented with
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.300]   and having to then adapt.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.620]   And I think, you know, as a creative, I'd never really,
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.340]   even though I'd manage people,
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.740]   managing people and running a business is totally different.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.660]   So I'm just describing like some of the things,
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.260]   but then there's the business planning,
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.540]   there's the hiring and firing,
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.180]   there's the accounting side of it.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.980]   There's eventually, we got a fourth partner
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.580]   who did all the financial planning
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.020]   and it's like the line item, cash flow, all that stuff.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.860]   And yeah, if I sat back at any one point
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.060]   to think about all the things that I had to accomplish
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.660]   to get that business afloat and then keep it going,
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.940]   I was way over my head.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.540]   Like I had no experience doing that stuff,
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.580]   but I learned by doing and I learned a lot.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.620]   - Were you ever afraid, Jesse,
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.100]   that you would be exposed, you know,
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.340]   for not being the expert
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.180]   that your rate supposed to justify, right?
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.140]   So you negotiated blended rate.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.340]   It assumes you have expertise,
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.540]   but obviously you know that you're in a degree
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.740]   kind of putting yourself out there,
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.180]   maybe overselling and kind of growing in a process.
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.100]   Like, was there ever like a fear
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.900]   that you wouldn't be able to meet the expectation
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.860]   or was that pressure added to yourself?
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.740]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.100]   I think if I said I wasn't afraid,
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.900]   if anyone said, you know, no, I had no fear
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.380]   when presented with an opportunity
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.940]   that I didn't really have experience with
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.740]   and therefore didn't have maybe the confidence
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.780]   or the experience of going through something successfully
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.900]   or even unsuccessfully.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.340]   So yeah, there was a lot of fear, but you know what?
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.940]   I learned to rely on other people.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.780]   When they asked me for a media plan,
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.060]   I went out and got a media planner.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.500]   When they asked me for,
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.620]   I think video production at one time,
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.620]   we went out and got a video production person.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.180]   When they asked for brand strategy,
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.260]   I did as much as I could,
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.580]   but I brought in an expert to look at my work.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.740]   You know, I produced a brand narrative
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.380]   before I presented to the client.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.500]   On the side, I sent it out to someone I knew
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.620]   in the brand strategy world who could help me refine it.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.300]   Then once I had that first client
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.900]   and then we were operating as business,
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.860]   there was three of us,
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.140]   in order to get more business,
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.460]   I worked through my network.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.660]   So everyone that I worked with initially knew me.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.340]   I wasn't over-promising.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.980]   They knew my history.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.060]   It wasn't until a few months had gone by
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.940]   that we started bringing in clients
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.220]   that didn't know us at all.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.380]   And they were often startups
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.700]   who looked to our experience with,
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.540]   you know, as contributors or managers
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.140]   at larger corporations like Google and other places.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.660]   And so that gave us credibility,
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.740]   gave me credibility, I think.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.700]   You know, often I was the one
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.140]   doing the business development,
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.540]   meaning getting those new clients,
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.620]   like talking to them up,
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.340]   talking them up about our offer and our promise
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340]   and what we could do.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.260]   So certainly the fear motivated me
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.140]   to search for answers, you know,
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.420]   and be flexible and in a way that was accelerated.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.860]   Like I wasn't waiting around to make a decision.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.220]   You know, if a client called me up
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.580]   and we had been engaged for a little while
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.020]   and they said, there was one client
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.020]   that they engaged with us
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.620]   to do a full-scale content marketing operation.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.900]   So it meant they were launching this business,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.500]   they wanted to produce all this content
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.820]   to get credibility, but they had no positioning.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.660]   So all of a sudden they wanted
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.380]   a brand positioning playbook.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.100]   And I reached out to another colleague
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.220]   who ran specifically a brand branding agency
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.780]   and I got a playbook,
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.940]   like a template that I could use
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.140]   to then go into a workshop
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.500]   to get my new client to a place
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.700]   where they had a starting point in terms of positioning.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.700]   And I had enough information
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.820]   and I had enough information
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.380]   and I brought in one of the people
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.220]   at this other agency
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.980]   to help guide us through that process.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.500]   So, you know, there's always a sense
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.180]   that I could go and find somebody
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.980]   that had more expertise than I had.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.220]   And I think that was really critical
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.220]   to know sort of how much I knew
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.140]   where the limits of my knowledge was
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.860]   and what I needed to ask, you know, for support.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.500]   And there's a lot of people
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.340]   in the marketing community
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.180]   that are willing to help,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.500]   especially if you're willing to pay them
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.340]   some amount of money.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.260]   So, or, you know, even if you just need an ear,
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.140]   I think our business is very competitive
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.300]   and certainly the agency business
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.420]   is exceptionally competitive
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.220]   and you have a lot of talented creatives
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.580]   and strategists and planners
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.900]   that can really help businesses
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.020]   that often in Silicon Valley anyway,
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.060]   you see lots of startups with engineering
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.500]   or some kind of technical expertise
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   that their founders bring to the table,
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.060]   but very little marketing expertise.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.020]   And so they're really, really desperate
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.580]   for someone to understand how to tell their story
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.420]   and bring it to market
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.340]   in a cohesive, consistent way.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.420]   So it's amazing, I think,
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.100]   how after a few years as a marketer,
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.140]   how much expertise and experience you have
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.780]   compared to the rest of the world,
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.620]   the business world.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.860]   And I think what I would say
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.940]   to people that are starting out
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.220]   that maybe haven't done anything on their own,
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.420]   whether it's a freelance thing
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.180]   or more of a collective effort,
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.380]   like a small agency is you have experience,
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.900]   some years of experience,
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.060]   and it's given you some level of expertise.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.740]   That's your shingle, right?
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.500]   That's the thing you put out on the door.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.980]   And should you talk to anyone
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.420]   and let them know they might be interested,
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.660]   they spread the word,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.700]   like these things just kind of get momentum
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.700]   on their own, I think.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.980]   And the other thing I would say
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.980]   is as you're learning to deal with things
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.940]   that are way over your head
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.140]   that maybe you've never done before,
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.980]   and you're scared,
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.860]   you develop a narrative.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.220]   Like the way I'm being able to talk about this process,
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.860]   I think is invaluable
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.740]   when you're going out to pitch for new business,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.220]   or you just, like I'm doing now,
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.260]   being a consultant,
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.980]   and I wanna talk to not just potential clients,
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.700]   but current clients
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.460]   that wanna understand how to solve problems.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.460]   Like I can bring that confidence
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.340]   and that the experience I have
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.100]   is forms a narrative that,
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.260]   you know, isn't just a straight line.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.340]   It's yeah, there's challenges,
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.180]   there's peaks and valleys,
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.380]   but you get,
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.060]   this is how you get through that.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.540]   It's been invaluable.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.020]   I think to be over my head
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.940]   and to be challenged
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.580]   has been an invaluable experience.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:33.300]   - There's an element of Jesse,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.300]   what Jesse was saying there
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.780]   that brought to mind
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.220]   a couple of my favorite
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.700]   or least favorite expressions
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.500]   that you hear often around the workplace,
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.980]   especially in sort of small business,
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.500]   startup land.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.580]   One is fake it until you make it.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.780]   And the other is act like you've been there before.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.460]   And I think Jesse's sort of concluding points are,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.180]   you know, you don't need to fake who you are as a whole.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.020]   You need to focus in on what your strengths are
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.780]   and get help around the periphery, right?
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.620]   'Cause you're,
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.420]   even if you're feeling like you're in over your head,
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.140]   you're there for a reason
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.420]   and you need to remember what those reasons are.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.460]   That doesn't mean you know everything about everything
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.820]   and you never will,
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.820]   but you can,
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.420]   there's resources to sort of fill in the blanks
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.860]   and nobody would expect you,
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.180]   or Jesse in this case,
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.540]   to know everything about running an agency
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540]   right at the start, right?
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.020]   But they hired him for his experiences
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.140]   and his, you know,
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.180]   the sort of the core,
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.540]   you know, experience and talents that he had.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.220]   So my story is a little bit different.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.860]   I was at Logitech and you guys both knew me,
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.340]   I think in the gaming role.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.940]   And that was, I didn't start in gaming.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.220]   I started in the corporate marketing
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.660]   and the public relations team.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.420]   I was a communications guy by background
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.540]   and had a desire at a certain point
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.340]   to get closer to the product
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.540]   because product marketing always fascinated me.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.340]   So I was talking with the gaming guys,
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.420]   a lot of them were my friends
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.420]   and they had a,
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.780]   they were looking for a game developer relations manager
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.620]   to start.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.300]   And what they liked in me
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.900]   was that I had experience with relationships
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.020]   and in doing public relations and media relations
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.060]   and specifically.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.100]   And so partner, you know,
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.300]   partner marketing was,
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.740]   they were looking for with, you know,
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.340]   some of the big game publishers
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.860]   and game developers was not too far removed
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.700]   from the kind of work I'd done with,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.220]   you know, public relations in the past.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.500]   And they liked my writing ability
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.860]   because they wanted to do,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.100]   you know, targeted newsletters
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.100]   to keep developers up to date on,
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.820]   you know, what was happening in that realm.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.820]   But I felt completely off my skis
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.340]   when it came to gaming.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.740]   I was not a gamer.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.340]   Yeah, I'm a very casual gamer,
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.180]   you might say,
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.300]   but I knew nothing about the world of,
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.340]   you know, MMOs and World of Warcraft
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.540]   and first person shooters.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.820]   And that was not my forte.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.340]   And it was,
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.700]   I often felt like I was in over my head,
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.540]   but every time I did,
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   I would try to bring myself back to like,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.180]   you know, I'm offering something
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.580]   that's a little bit different
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.140]   as a complimentary piece to this group.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.300]   And these guys that I work with
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.540]   are classic hardcore gamers, right?
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.300]   So they've got that piece taken care of.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.300]   I just need to focus on what I do well
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   and add that layer to what they're doing.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.460]   But I would urge everybody if they,
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.540]   to cringe a little bit,
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.780]   if they ever hear "fake it till you make it."
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.460]   It's good to have confidence.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.540]   It's good to believe that you can problem solve
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.220]   and fix things maybe that you haven't seen before.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.660]   But never, I would say,
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.780]   never misrepresent who you are
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.620]   and what your experiences are.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.140]   Trying to jump in and do it yourself
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.180]   and maybe make a mess of things.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.020]   - I would just add,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.740]   you know, there's something you said at the end there,
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.740]   Troy, about confidence and belief.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.420]   And there's a difference between believing and doing.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.100]   You know, I can believe I'm an incredible chef,
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.940]   but ask me how to make a incredible meal.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.660]   And I can't break down the steps
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.780]   'cause I actually don't know how to do it.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.700]   I'm not a very good cook.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.540]   I wouldn't know how to tell you to,
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.380]   I can boil water and things like that.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.900]   And I think that the trick is,
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.660]   especially, and I think in our culture
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.900]   and maybe in the business culture at large,
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.980]   there's a real emphasis on confidence and belief.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.740]   Believe in yourself, things will come true.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.700]   Believe in the three steps to success, they'll come true.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.420]   But there's a different type of knowledge
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.220]   and that's the knowledge of the process
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.940]   to get to those things.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.900]   And so if you ask me, how do I,
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.220]   Jesse, how do you build a content marketing program
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.740]   that is effective over a 12-month period?
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.380]   I can break it down into the steps.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.060]   Well, first you wanna take a look at how you're doing now
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.420]   and audit your current library and its performance.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.820]   And you wanna look at the market and the competition
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.420]   to see what the topics are, the trends in the market
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.860]   and look at your product roadmap.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.220]   And there's all these steps to developing a plan
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.460]   that is very different from the belief
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.460]   that I can develop a plan.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:46.580]   And I think often, especially on social media sites
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.500]   like LinkedIn, there's an overemphasis in belief
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.780]   over the knowledge of actually how the process
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.620]   of something works.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.340]   And that second type of knowledge
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.500]   is often much more important than the first one.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.060]   Although I think, yeah, fake it till you make it.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.620]   I don't love that.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.380]   I think I'd like to say, know your limits.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.020]   Know your limits and know when you need help.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.340]   You know, and I think that's maybe a more realistic way
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.660]   to approach things.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.260]   I think if you take on something
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.940]   and you promise to do something you can't do,
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.900]   you're likely to be frustrated
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.060]   and frustrate other people as well.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.300]   - Yeah, I really agree.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.300]   As a matter of fact, my example is almost the opposite
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.820]   of you guys where I knew my limits
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.700]   and I had to intentionally retract.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:42.180]   So like you guys, most of my times were the fake it
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.420]   to make it or feeling in over your head.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.100]   Usually happens for me like when I get promoted a level,
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.260]   right, my responsibilities increase or whatnot.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.300]   And for the most part, because, you know,
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.940]   our skillsets as we get older,
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.900]   they become more broad and deep
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.420]   just 'cause you're able to expose more stuff.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.820]   I'm usually able to mask my deficiencies
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.580]   and quickly and read up and get smart about it.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:11.780]   My last role at A10 Networks didn't pan out the same way
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.620]   because, you know, for me, I'm a web marketer.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.220]   Digital marketing is a different skillset.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.820]   Now, web marketing is about, you know,
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.220]   pushing out content to prospect customers
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.380]   and trying to build the best experience
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.420]   to get them to engage, right?
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.660]   Now, digital marketing with paid is different.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.860]   It's typically a demand general, right?
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.700]   And so I've been involved with search engine marketing
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.020]   and I've owned that as a discipline or whatnot,
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:44.020]   but the broader field of demand generation, I've never run.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.220]   Now, I've sat very closely to sales and demand gen
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.220]   and channel that made me believe
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.140]   that if I were to take on demand gen right away,
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.220]   I could do it successfully from the ground,
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.060]   hit the ground running.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.500]   And so when I went to A10 Networks,
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   I was hired to run both demand gen and web marketing.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:13.100]   Where I started to feel pressure immediately was,
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.940]   and this is what I'm about to say
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.820]   is not necessarily just related to A10,
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.380]   but I think most companies can relate to this,
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.540]   which is a lot of times, like your ability to execute
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.020]   or make decisions is only as good
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.380]   as the data in front of you.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.820]   If you have bad data hygiene,
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.500]   it's really hard to make well-informed decisions, right?
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.500]   And so in this world, it was both a data hygiene issue
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.340]   where if I'm trying to understand my segments
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.420]   and understand where the opportunities are
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.580]   or how to measure, the data wasn't clean.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.180]   You pair that with cultural differences
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.380]   where demand gen, how it was maybe previously run
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.460]   or who was heavily influenced decisions,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.540]   and that differs by organization.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.940]   Sometimes the executive leadership has very high influence
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.060]   and they're in the weeds.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.100]   Sometimes it's hands-off completely, right?
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.500]   And in this case, the reputation of demand gen
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.740]   and how it worked with product marketing,
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.300]   I would describe it as not the healthiest.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.220]   And so the influence or expectations
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.460]   often were met with unrealistic expectations.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.460]   And so I came into a situation where I had to run demand gen
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.460]   and a lot of the pipeline work
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.020]   and upstream workflows were not ideal.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.540]   And I was not equipped to fix that.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.340]   Now, I came in, I was able to identify some gaps,
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.660]   you know, like I'm looking at the funnel,
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.260]   I can tell where the leaky bucket was in the data
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.180]   and I absolutely fix some things,
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.140]   but there truly is a strategic element
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.260]   where you have to understand at a company initiative level
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.260]   what your CEO is going for.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.420]   And you have to know the product well enough to discern
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.020]   if what the marketing leadership is pushing for
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.540]   is different, right?
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.380]   And then you need to break it down by the regents
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.140]   and NGOs and how are they all interpreting a mission.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.460]   And all of this, if they're not aligned,
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.740]   it becomes really hard to execute tactically
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.820]   on things like campaign kits or whatnot.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.260]   And so I had never been exposed to that up-level stream
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.620]   as it pertains to demand gen.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.140]   I've only seen execution.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.140]   And so I was very unequipped
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.140]   and the team was really, really lean,
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.980]   which means you're a player coach.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.940]   And so I quickly immediately felt over my head
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.780]   'cause I had never had execute either.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.420]   And so the areas that I was focused on optimizing,
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.180]   like some of those campaigns turned really, really well,
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.100]   but solving for a campaign is different
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.460]   than solving for a broader company strategy.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.580]   And I'll describe it as,
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.660]   I was focused on solving a $50,000 problem
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.740]   when I was ignoring the million, right?
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.020]   'Cause I just didn't have the expertise.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.620]   And so by focusing all of my attention on that,
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.420]   my other half of my responsibility,
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.100]   which is web marketing, was basically ignored, right?
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.220]   And there's a lot of things that that team need to do.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.260]   And also it was a very lean team.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.780]   They were awesome at what they did,
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.060]   but they still needed a leadership.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.500]   That's what I was hired for.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.980]   And so two months into my job,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.820]   I would say my focus is like 90% on demand gen,
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.260]   of which I was probably only 50% efficient or effective
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.660]   and only 10% on web.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.780]   And so none of the things under my purview
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.540]   were succeeding well.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.380]   And my inability to understand demand gen
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.580]   was confusing the demand gen team.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.780]   So I wasn't doing anyone a service.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:45.500]   And so I ended up going to my VP
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.900]   and I said, "Look, man,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.740]   I know you hired me to do these things
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.780]   and I'm working my damnedest to get it done.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.540]   It's only been a one quarter engagement so far
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.780]   and I'm not doing well."
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.100]   And to your point earlier, you guys,
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.580]   about knowing your limits, I knew my limits.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.900]   I had no way to bring in extra help.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.860]   And the help that I had or that the resources,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.740]   they didn't have enough experience
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.620]   to solve the strategic gaps I was missing.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.700]   So there was no nothing, thumbs up from Zoom.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.100]   There was nothing for me to pull from, right?
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.700]   And so that conversation was interesting.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.620]   I was like, I was mentally ready to get let go.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:34.260]   I was mentally ready to get demoted.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.820]   And that's what I expected to happen.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.180]   And so in the end, thankfully,
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.220]   I was not removed from my position,
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.460]   but I did get my role divided, right?
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.540]   And the learning point for that was
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.580]   how do you exit a role gracefully?
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.060]   So I took all my observations that were true
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.020]   and presented them to the VP to help them understand,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.500]   "Hey, look, for anyone stepping into this job,
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.820]   here are the things that they need to be aware of
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.380]   that I wish I knew before I took this job,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.580]   or otherwise I might not have taken it."
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.860]   And that helps set them up
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.460]   to identify the next replacement, right?
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.700]   So yeah, that was my experience being over my head.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.060]   And I just wanna share that one 'cause like you guys,
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.540]   most of the other ones I was able to power through,
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.260]   but that's one where I had to wave the white flag
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.700]   and I had to figure out a way to do that.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.700]   How you position yourself and provide a plan forward
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.420]   is a difference between,
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:41.180]   I guess, retracting and having a positive outcome
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.340]   rather than retracting and leaving it,
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.780]   like the control out of our hands, right?
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.020]   So I feel like I had a little more control
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.140]   over my destiny by handling it that way.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.300]   So I've already kind of put a wrap
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.460]   on this particular conversation.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.300]   I think we all agree.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   And like, first of all, acknowledge that in any situation,
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.540]   you bring value, you are hired to do that role
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.660]   'cause you're experienced.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.820]   And so lean into it.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.100]   But as you're doing that and you're growing
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.580]   and growing is a natural part of our jobs,
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.980]   know your limits and pull in help when you need to, right?
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.100]   And whether that's through external help
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.860]   or maybe even setting your scope appropriately
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.780]   when you realize you're hitting something
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.740]   that's kind of come out of your purview.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.380]   But know that there's so many resources out there for you
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.420]   and don't wait until you're drowning in a deep end
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.180]   before you decide to call for help.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.100]   Hey guys, thanks again for watching and listening.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.300]   Next week, we'll be talking about
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.700]   how to deal with imposter syndrome.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.900]   So make sure you hit like, subscribe
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.700]   and the notification bell so you don't miss the episode.
