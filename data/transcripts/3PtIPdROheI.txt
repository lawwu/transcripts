[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   A woman in Sioux Falls, South Dakota writes in to ask, "Pastor John, at times it
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.660]   feels selfish to pray constantly for God to give me joy. How does a Christian
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680]   hedonist who groans to glorify God use prayer to increase his joy in God
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.160]   without feeling selfish for asking so frequently?" We must define selfishness in
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.640]   a way that is different from the pursuit of joy that the Bible commends. And here
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.460]   are my distinctions. I'll give you several. Selfishness, which is a bad thing,
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.620]   I'm assuming it's bad. There's a bad definition for selfishness and this is
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.680]   what I mean by the badness of it. It's wanting the exaltation of self without
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.440]   loving the superior exaltation of God. Number two, selfishness is wanting
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.800]   something for yourself at the expense of others. Number three, selfishness is
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.080]   wanting to be happy without our happiness being in the happiness of
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:25.840]   othersâ€”happiness. And four, selfishness is wanting to be happy without the
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.280]   happiness being a power to make others happy with the very happiness we have in
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.040]   God. So those are my four distinguishings of selfishness from the biblical pursuit
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.080]   of joy. If our craving for joy, our prayer for joy, turns into one of those, we should
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.440]   feel selfish and we should feel bad and we should repent. But Christian hedonism
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.040]   is specifically designed to prevent all four of those. And here's how. Christian
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:14.680]   hedonism always stresses that our joy is in God. We don't merely pursue joy for
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.600]   joy, we pursue joy in God. That's the first thing. We've got to keep that in mind
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.880]   all the time. Christian hedonism then, as we see from texts like Philippians 1:19
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:40.280]   to 23, shows that God is magnified by our being satisfied in him. So this joy is
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.680]   always putting the exaltation of God over the exaltation of self because the
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.120]   satisfaction of self in God magnifies God. So we never ever exalt ourselves
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.640]   above God by being satisfied by God. Christian hedonism teaches that it is
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.520]   more blessed to give than to receive, X 2035, which means that our joy in
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.640]   God increases when it expands to meet the needs of others. Our joy increases
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.520]   when others come to share it. Joy is not the kind of thing that if others get
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:31.760]   some, you get less. It's just the opposite. If my joy can expand to include you in
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.200]   it so that yours increases from mine, mine gets bigger. And so there's a built-in
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.240]   protection against exclusivism. Christian joy has an expansive impulse to it
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.440]   because it knows that when others share it, it gets bigger. And we are, after all,
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.640]   Christian hedonists. We don't exclude others. We want more and more and more
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.080]   people to be included in it, which is the opposite of selfishness. And then
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.320]   Christian hedonism teaches that our happiness in God is the very power to lay
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.360]   down our lives for others. Jesus, for the joy that was set before him, endured the
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.760]   cross. So Jesus' deep sense of satisfaction in his father and what his
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.680]   father had planned for him on the other side of the resurrection was the very
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.720]   power that enabled him to die for us. And that's exactly the way we should
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.080]   be motivated, as Hebrews 1034 shows. You had compassion on those in prison. So
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.640]   there you are, loving those in prison at great risk. Why? You joyfully accept the
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.880]   plundering of your property since you knew that you yourselves had a better
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.800]   possession and an abiding one. So it's the confidence, "My happiness is in God. He
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.640]   has taken care of me. He has infinite pleasures awaiting me at his right hand.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.240]   He is presently the satisfier of my soul. How could I in any selfish impulse not go
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.760]   to the prison and risk my life to help my brothers and sisters there?" So finding my
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.920]   fullest satisfaction in God frees me from the need to protect myself and
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.040]   impels me to a life of sacrifice. So to the question then that I think was
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.640]   being asked about prayer, how do we not feel selfish by repeatedly praying for
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.880]   joy in God? I would say keep all of that in mind and then do precisely what the
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:50.080]   Psalms say the psalmist did. Psalm 90 verse 14, "Praise, satisfy me in the
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   morning with your steadfast love that I may rejoice and be glad all my day." So
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.800]   here's a psalmist praying every day, "Today Lord, satisfy me." And if his joy
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.600]   dribbles away, Psalm 51 verse 12, "Restore to me the joy of your salvation and uphold
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.880]   me with a willing spirit." And the reason those constantly repeating prayers don't
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   turn us into selfish people is because number one, they glorify God. Number two,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.300]   they humble us as ever needy of his satisfying presence. Number three, they
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:33.840]   incline us to increase our joy by expanding it into the lives of others.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:42.760]   That's why we want it. And those prayers for joy free us from self-protection so
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.040]   that we could spend our lives in sacrificial love to others. Thank you,
