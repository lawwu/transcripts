[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   There's one more slide that we have to deal with when it comes to dealing with the goals
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.500]   of counseling, and it's a slide that really helps us to set things up for the next part
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.660]   of our class, which deals with the process of dynamics of marriage and family counseling.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.220]   And this particular slide really has to deal with the overall eight I's.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:42.580]   Now this is just something that was developed to help us to remember key areas of the counseling
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:51.160]   process, and it has to do with really the issue that Ephesians 4 talks about, beginning
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.520]   in verse 22, putting off and putting on, the counseling process, in a sense, is dedicated
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040]   to that.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.940]   And our purpose here is, in the early part of counseling, to get at the root issues of
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.320]   people's hearts, address these with what the Bible says is going on, diagnose them properly
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.700]   when there's been a problem between a husband and a wife, and then help them, obviously,
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.560]   to change, because all counseling has that in common.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.600]   We want to change so that people will bear good fruit.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.640]   Well, the first aspect of that, putting off, requires involvement with the family.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   That is, creating that type of relationship where they know, in the depths of their heart,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.440]   that we have their long-term interests, first and foremost, in mind.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.520]   We've gained involvement when that has happened.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.320]   When they know that we have their long-term interest in mind, we can't just assume that.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.120]   These may be people that have been a part of our church for many years, and we can't
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.760]   just assume that they believe that we are their good friends.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.040]   They may not assume that.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   They may not think that we have their long-term interest in mind in relationship to what is
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   godly and what is righteous and what is Christlike.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.240]   So we have to gain involvement with them.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.800]   That's vitally important.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.160]   Secondly, has to do with inspiration.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.720]   We have to give them hope.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.700]   Most people who have been struggling with marital problems or family problems have lost
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.960]   a lot of hope.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.960]   They're discouraged.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.280]   They're unhappy.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.080]   And they've tried to resolve their problems in the past, and there hasn't been a whole
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.460]   lot of success in resolving them.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.360]   So they've lost a lot of hope.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.100]   So you spend a good deal of time ministering hope, biblical hope to them.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.520]   Help them to understand that God intends only good to come out of this.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.760]   It's kind of that same thing that Joseph said to his brothers in Genesis 50-20.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.440]   You intended this for evil, but God intended it for good, the saving of many lives.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.700]   So people and circumstances may be evil in our lives, but God ends up taking that evil
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.780]   and turning it around to that which is best for us, for you and me.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.960]   And so in counseling, it's vitally important that we communicate that kind of hope.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.980]   One of the best verses to do that is 1 Corinthians 10-13.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.580]   "There is therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus."
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.940]   Oh, I'm actually quoting Romans 8-1.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.940]   "No temptation has taken you except for what is common to man, and God is faithful.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.700]   He will not allow us to be tempted above what we're able."
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.900]   So 1 Corinthians 10-13 communicates a lot of hope.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.780]   In other words, there's nothing that we're facing in life that's absolutely unique.
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.700]   Other people have faced it, and they've been able to face it successfully, and they've
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.220]   been able to handle these type of problems successfully with God's help.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.740]   Romans 8-28-29 is another couple of verses that are oriented towards hope.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.080]   Or Romans 15-4, "The scriptures were given to us so that through our study of them and
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.460]   through perseverance, we might have hope."
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.380]   So there's no reason that we shouldn't have hope.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.700]   I don't care what the problem would be as long as God is behind the problem.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.620]   Sometimes I say to counselees in this inspiration phase of counseling, so to speak, I say, "Your
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.940]   problem looks like a gigantic mountain in front of you, right?"
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.940]   This is huge.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.220]   This is huge in my life.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.580]   But I want you to be able to lift your eyes above and behind that mountain and see God
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580]   standing.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.700]   He's bigger than this mountain.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.780]   This problem looks like a gigantic mountain, but I want you to see God standing behind
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.780]   that mountain.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.780]   He's bigger than this mountain in your life.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.780]   And that's when they begin to have hope, when they lift their eyes above their problems
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.580]   and look at God in the picture.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.220]   So that's when inspiration actually takes over.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.160]   Then if we really truly are concerned about resolving their problem, then that brings
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.260]   us to the third area here, which has to do with inventory.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.180]   Inventory is where we do a lot of data gathering.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:36.220]   Proverbs 13:15 talks about the fact that a man who speaks before he hears is a fool.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.660]   And we don't want to be foolish in our counseling.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.580]   We want to listen carefully to where people are coming from.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.660]   We want to listen carefully to their problems.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.740]   I had a young lady earlier in one of our college classes today ask me the question about the
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.620]   fact, what do you do if you have a friend or somebody that comes to you and they share
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.700]   with you some information about someone else and you attempt to help them from the word
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.060]   of God deal with this problem?
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.580]   And remember that from a biblical perspective, it's not gossip if you're a part of the problem
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.740]   or you're a part of the solution of the problem.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.300]   It's not gossip.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.420]   But if you're just listening to bad things about other people, that's gossip.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.860]   And this gal moved right in and wanted to help her friend.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.220]   Well, the other person in the party also came along and started talking with her.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.340]   And she was asking me the question, how do you keep from being prejudiced in those kind
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.140]   of situations?
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:39.900]   And my answer to her was Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 17, where it says, "The first
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.400]   to plead his case seems right until another comes and examines him."
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.800]   So when you're data gathering, especially in a family counseling situation, you've got
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.940]   to listen to all sides of the story.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:00.160]   And boy, that's especially true in marital conflicts.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.480]   I've had husband or a wife come to me and start describing what's going on in their
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.480]   marriage.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.320]   And when they got done, I thought that their spouse was the worst person to walk the planet.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.400]   All right, then later on, I had a chance to talk with their spouse.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.120]   And all of a sudden, that changed the whole picture.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.640]   Now I understood this a little bit better.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.520]   I got a different perspective on what was going on between them.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   But just looking at one side of the story seemed to distort the whole thing.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.040]   So you've got to do proper data gathering.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.240]   I had said earlier that that other passage was Proverbs 13, 15.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.680]   It's actually Proverbs 18, 13, "He who gives an answer before he hears, it is a fall and
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.960]   a shame to him."
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.200]   That's the importance of good data gathering and counseling.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.380]   We don't want our counselees to have fools for counselors.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.560]   And how's that going to happen?
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.400]   Well, we're going to ask a lot of questions.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.360]   We're going to collect a lot of information.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.520]   We're going to make sure we get all sides of the story.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.320]   We won't jump to conclusions, or we won't allow ourselves to become biased or prejudiced
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.360]   in one way or another.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.720]   And that's another thing, by the way, oftentimes you have to say to a husband or a wife, "Listen,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.680]   I'm not on your side, Tom.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.060]   And Terry, I'm not on your side either.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.240]   I'm on God's side.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.660]   I want God to win out here."
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.720]   It's not important whether or not Tom wins out or Terry wins out.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.480]   What's really important here is whether or not God wins out.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.920]   That's the side that I'm on.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.760]   So you've got to collect a lot of good information.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.400]   Well, after you've collected it, then what are you going to do with it?
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.240]   Which brings us to number four.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.080]   Then you have to take that information and you have to spend a little bit of time thinking
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.160]   through it.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.500]   That's part of interpretation.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.200]   How are you going to interpret what's going on in that marriage?
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.760]   What are the core problems?
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.020]   And then you have to prioritize those core problems.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.400]   What are the things that I need to address first and what do I need to put off and address
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.940]   later?
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:14.720]   Sometimes expediency rules and you have to address some external issues before you can
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.840]   really get down to the hard issues that are important issues.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   Just to sort of get those things out of the way, so to speak, so that they don't cause
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.160]   any more additional damage.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.460]   You can't always just go into counseling and go right after a hard issue.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.080]   So that's the interpretational phrase.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.040]   And once you get to that, then you have a pretty good idea what's going on at the root
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.040]   of this marital conflict or this problem at the root.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.440]   What is going on in the heart?
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.740]   Then you need to address this and putting on the good fruit through instruction.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.420]   That is bringing the word of God to bear upon it.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.040]   Not only does the word of God help us to diagnose the problem, but it also gives us the remedy
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.720]   or the cure for the problem.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.320]   So our instruction, our teaching at this point, helps them to understand what they need to
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.100]   do in this issue.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.800]   Then number six has to do with inducement.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.840]   And then that means it's not enough to just merely teach them the word of God.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:25.720]   We have to encourage them, persuade them to follow the word of God.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.860]   The apostle Paul was fond of using the word "urge."
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.040]   "I urge you."
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.320]   And when he uses that word "urge," he's trying to be persuasive.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.960]   He's turning up the emotional pressure on them.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.400]   He's saying, "You need to follow this.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:52.720]   I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720]   I urge you."
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.620]   Why is he doing that?
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.620]   That's inducement.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.720]   It's not enough to just teach factual things about the Bible and expect your counselees
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.400]   to naturally respond.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.640]   You've got to encourage them, persuade them, induce them, urge them.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.480]   You have to be persuasive.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.760]   Just the way you would put together a sermon to be persuasive to your congregation, you
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.580]   have to put together the data for your counseling to be persuasive to people.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.900]   So it's not just enough to just teach the Bible.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.340]   You've got to be persuasive with the Bible.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.460]   Now there's a difference between being persuasive and being manipulative.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:45.180]   You know that you're becoming manipulative when you're issuing threats, especially personal
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.820]   threats.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:52.180]   No, you're not being, you're not supposed to be manipulative.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.660]   As counselors, we don't do that.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.860]   We're supposed to be persuasive.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.620]   This has got to make sense to them because this is going to be hard for them to do to
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.560]   make these changes.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.780]   So inducement is number six, implementation is number seven.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.940]   Then you need to show them and teach them how they can take these biblical truths and
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.660]   really implement them for life change in their life.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:27.460]   Now you're getting to some very practical things, very practical suggestions.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.700]   How can I implement this so that my life will really change?
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.220]   What is it do I need to, what do I need to change on a motivational level?
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.500]   What do I need to change on a thinking level?
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.940]   What do I need to change on a behavioral level?
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.260]   How am I going to go about that particular change?
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.620]   So you need to help them to implement those changes.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.800]   And then last of all, number eight is integration.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:05.060]   That is, this is sort of a Galatians chapter six and verse one process where you're trying
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:13.360]   to restore them back to good functioning as a husband and a wife, as a family, back into
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.820]   the church.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.420]   This particular sin has paralyzed them and it's broken them down.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.260]   They're no longer functioning well and now you've showed them what they need to do to
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:32.420]   change and they've begun the process of change and the restoration has come around.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.500]   Now what do you do?
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:41.620]   Now you need to integrate them right back into the body life of the church, back into
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:48.140]   normal functioning, only probably for the first time ever in their marital life or in
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.580]   their family are they really responding and interacting with each other in a biblical
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.740]   way.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:05.460]   So you need to spend time integrating them back into the body life of the church, back
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:13.260]   into normal life again where they're ministering and serving God and serving other people in
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:24.100]   such a way that people are blessed.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:33.020]   People actually are benefited from their service.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.900]   Now they have ceased being a liability in your church and now they've become an asset
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:45.520]   to your church because you have taken them through that restoration process.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.140]   So that's what we mean by the eight I's.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:54.700]   Those eight things are key for putting off the old way of life, putting on the new way
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:01.480]   of life and bringing about lasting biblical change.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:08.420]   Now that helps to set us up to talk about the process dynamics in counseling and we're
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.660]   going to take these eight I's and sort of break them down for marriage and family purposes
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:20.740]   into a little acrostic CAPT, I talked about that in our last class period.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:28.660]   The first one C actually stands for what is the context, A has to do with assessment,
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:37.280]   P has to do with how to make those things permanent and T has to do with when do I know
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.220]   that it's a good time to terminate counseling and graduate them from counseling.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.620]   So let's deal with C first of all.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.920]   What about context?
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:53.980]   This is where you're trying to nurture a conducive atmosphere in which a relationship may grow.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:59.320]   You cultivate rapport, hope, involvement and inspiration of the eight I's is what you're
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:08.220]   interested in here with a marriage and a family couple.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.220]   Well how do you do that?
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:17.840]   Number one, you have to build the session tasks, build the session tasks.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   That involves establish a definite time and a place to meet.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:36.220]   That time should be a time where they can be alert, they're not tired, it's not something
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.780]   that's late at night where they're ready to go to bed and they're really sleepy.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:51.820]   They can be alert, they can interact with each other well, it needs to be a time like
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.820]   that.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.900]   And then they need to have the right kind of place and this is usually a place without
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.900]   distractions.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:07.780]   No phone calls or cell phones or children interrupting them.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.420]   Sometimes it's helpful just within an American or European culture to get them to come to
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.660]   an office at the church.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:22.500]   Because if a person has to leave their home and go to an office, it's just much more,
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:29.180]   they're in much more of a mood to do business, to really get down and work on things.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:35.020]   If they're in the comfort of their own home, they have a tendency to be a little bit more
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:43.900]   lazy, slothful and follow through.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.500]   Now can you counsel people in their homes?
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.300]   Yes, you can.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.620]   And certainly according to Acts chapter 20 and verse 20, that's what Paul did, he went
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.520]   from house to house.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.180]   So you can do that, it's not a bad thing to do it.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:05.100]   It's just that within our culture, sometimes people view the home as a place of relaxation,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.700]   escape from the pressures and stresses of the world.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.860]   It's a place where I really don't do anything real, real serious.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.500]   But if they have to get out and leave the home and go to somewhere like a church, a
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:24.340]   church building and sit down in an office across from a person at a desk, then they're
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.700]   much more alert, much more active, much more engaged in the counseling when they have to
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.000]   do that.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.220]   Sometimes I found that that's actually a preferable atmosphere.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.380]   I would tell people, you know, I'll spend a session or so with you in your home, but
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.460]   eventually I want to move over to my office.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:46.060]   Because one of the big things is, I have at my fingertips all the books I need, if I want
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.100]   to pull off books and I want them to study something, they're right there.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.500]   I have homework all set up in my drawers for them so I can pull that homework out and give
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.980]   it to them.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.540]   And then sending it home, send them home with that homework to finish.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:05.660]   So I have a lot more at my fingertips.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:11.100]   If I'm in my office setting and I've got my Bible there and all my teaching tools there
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.340]   and a whiteboard there and I can use that, that's going to be very helpful.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.740]   So establish a definite time and place.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.740]   >> Kind of a practical question.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:32.740]   How do you keep yourself above reproach if there's a woman, you know, and say it's a
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:39.540]   small church, you know, and your office is, you know, upstairs in the church or something?
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.460]   >> No, that's a very practical question.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:48.580]   How do you keep yourself above reproach if you're a pastor and there's a woman that needs
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.700]   counseling in your congregation?
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.100]   Can a pastor, there's a fundamental question that's kind of behind that.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.100]   Can a pastor counsel a woman?
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.940]   And I want to say absolutely yes.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.920]   If you don't, then you're cutting off half of your congregation from the person who's
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.060]   supposed to be theologically trained.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.100]   And that's not good.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.700]   That doesn't mean that there can't be other people within the congregation who can eventually,
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.260]   if you train them right in the Word of God, counsel them.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.620]   But you're cutting them off from the theological expert and that theological expert is the
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.180]   person who should know how to counsel their problem well.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:35.820]   So the answer is yes, but you're exactly right because even though your intentions may be
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:43.220]   absolutely 100% pure, you want to avoid the appearance of evil of anything that happens.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:50.340]   So it's always been a policy and it even is here at the Master College and Seminary in
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:58.260]   my offices that, in fact, we have a policy hanging on the wall that says a male faculty
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.620]   member cannot counsel a female without another person present, especially another female
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:09.860]   present whether it be an admin assistant or someone has to be there in order for that
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.860]   to take place.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:16.180]   And when that happens, then the window on their door has to be opened, all right.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.380]   In other words, there's nothing covering the window so people walking by can see everything
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.580]   that's going on in that office.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.660]   If you come to my office, there's a big window there and you can see what's going on and
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.660]   if there's a gal in there, then that window is always open.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.380]   People can always see what's happening there.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.100]   And that you always station yourself on one side of a desk and she's on the other side
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.220]   of the desk.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.860]   Now I know that there are some pastors who say, "I don't counsel women because too many
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.140]   pastors have fallen that way."
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.140]   And that's true.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.260]   A lot of pastors have fallen that way, but a lot of pastors also have fallen with secretaries
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.260]   too.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.260]   So are we going to rule out secretaries?
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.100]   I know of pastors who have fallen in the ministry by going house to house evangelism.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.420]   So are we going to stop evangelism too based upon that same rationale?
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.300]   No, I don't think so.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.340]   I don't think we're going to do that.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.020]   All of this is dealing with the personal lives of people.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:13.180]   No, but you have to set it up in such a way where there is no temptation or there's no
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.760]   hint of temptation that's going on there.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.900]   So I don't want to cut off half the congregation from the person who's supposed to be theologically
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.340]   trained.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.140]   Those women need answers.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.860]   Now, later on, when you get into a church and you train up a group of women in your
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:38.780]   church who are just as competent as you are dealing and handling the Word of God, then
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.580]   you don't have to counsel women anymore.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.620]   It's great, man.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.100]   You've got them all trained up.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.460]   Some of the women in my congregation were actually better counselors than I were.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:52.380]   And I would have a tendency to deal real gently with some of these women.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.620]   I mean, my goodness, they would go after the juggler vein.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.660]   They'd really go after him.
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.460]   They wouldn't cut him any slack at all.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.040]   And they were really good at it.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.740]   They didn't let him slide by on their excuses.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:16.620]   So sometimes it may take you a while to train those kind of people up that will really take
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.980]   on that kind of administering, and until you do, you've still got to be able to minister
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.580]   to people.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.580]   Let me show this to you.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.460]   Go over to Colossians 128.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:40.900]   Colossians 128, Paul talks about the fact of his own personal ministry.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:47.260]   And actually, Colossians 128 is about his counseling ministry primarily.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:53.460]   He says, "We proclaim him admonishing," there's our word, "nuthateo," admonishing, warn, instructing,
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:59.340]   counseling every man, teaching every man with all wisdom so that we may present every
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.660]   man complete in Christ.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:11.900]   Now mankind here is used generically, so he's talking about both men and women.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.140]   That's what he would do.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.840]   He would admonish men and women in his congregation.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:22.020]   He would teach men and women in the congregation so that he might present every man or woman
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.580]   complete in Christ.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:32.340]   So that was Paul's desire, that's what he wanted.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:41.580]   So I don't think it's wrong that a guy can counsel a woman in a congregation, but you
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:50.300]   do have to set up safeguards so no failure occurs.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.600]   And that your congregation understands those safeguards.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.300]   If you have secretaries in the church, they understand all the procedures.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.180]   You have other staff members in the church, they also understand the procedures.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:10.060]   And again, your motivation may be absolutely 100% pure.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.760]   Let me give you another example.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:22.440]   Back several years ago, I know of a situation where a pastor, his wife had been sick for
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.460]   a long period of time, and the entire congregation was praying for her.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.940]   So this was common knowledge among the congregation.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:37.440]   She was at home in bed for many weeks.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.960]   And this pastor one night got a call from a woman in the congregation saying, "Pastor,
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.880]   I need your help and I need it now.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.060]   I'm in terrible trouble and I need for you to come over and help me."
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.720]   So the pastor said, "Okay, I'll be over."
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.400]   And as soon as he hung up, he called up one of the elders in his church and got him out
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   of bed.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.900]   This was like two or three o'clock in the morning, and said, "Hey, Joe, you need to
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.680]   go with me.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:10.160]   This woman in our congregation has got problems and we need to go over and help her."
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.360]   She was a single woman.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   And so, this is a true story.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.920]   They showed up at her apartment complex.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.160]   She lived on the second floor, and they went up to the second floor and knocked on her
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.160]   door.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.080]   And as soon as they knocked, she threw the door open and she was standing there in a
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.960]   negligee, and she wrapped her arms around the pastor and had a person standing behind
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.280]   her to take a picture.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:44.320]   And right in the middle of that picture was the elder, smiling.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.440]   If that pastor had not taken that elder, she was out to frame him.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.400]   That would have totally ruined his entire ministry.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.760]   She was out to destroy his ministry because there was something in the church that she
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.000]   didn't like.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.280]   And he was just there, genuinely, to help this woman.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:12.920]   So you may have an absolutely pure motive in helping, but you have to set it up so that
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.460]   those things don't happen.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:20.880]   You can easily lose your entire ministry if somebody sets you up for that.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.320]   So that's the reason those policies are not just to protect you against your own flesh
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:33.160]   or that other woman against her own flesh and its desires, but that policy there is
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.720]   to protect you from the wrong intentions of other people and the wrongdoings of other
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.200]   people.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   So that needs to be there.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.520]   So you asked a good question.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.200]   Any other questions about that?
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.680]   All right, well, so you have to have the right kind of time, you have to have the right kind
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.960]   of place, and it needs to be a place that's not filled with distractions.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:09.040]   I was working with a person back a few years ago who was trying to get their certification
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.640]   in counseling, and in the process of getting their certification, they set up a counseling
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.360]   appointment in a restaurant.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:24.680]   That's one of the worst places in the world to do counseling, and every five minutes the
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.520]   waitress is coming up asking, "Hey, do you need anything more to drink?
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.560]   Can I help you anymore?"
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.720]   You can't do that.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.840]   You can't do that in counseling.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.680]   You're constantly interrupted.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.160]   There are a thousand things that are going on, friends walking by the table, people you
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.480]   don't expect to be there, all kinds of...
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.080]   That's a terrible environment.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:47.560]   You need an environment, hopefully, that where you can meet with your counselee, there's
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.120]   some chairs there, and you can pull yourselves up to a table, and you can lay your Bibles
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:59.960]   on the table, you can lay your notebooks on the table, and you can really work on problems.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.760]   Let me mention one other thing about time.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.640]   Most counseling appointments should not exceed an hour.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.680]   Now, there's nothing in the Bible that says that.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:19.400]   It's just within our culture, people start to tune out after that.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:28.560]   Maybe an hour and a half at the longest, but from that point on, after you've gone 90 minutes,
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:34.640]   you get decreasing returns on your counseling.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.880]   People get tired.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.800]   You've been focusing and concentrating on issues, and working on change, and showing
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.520]   them what the Word of God has to say.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:50.360]   And our temptation is to give them the entire boatload of everything that they should know
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.920]   from the Bible about their problem in one session.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   That's our temptation.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   That's mine.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.280]   Maybe it's not yours, but it's mine.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.200]   And so, I'm just going on, and I'm going, "Let's go to this passage.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.280]   Let me explain to you this.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   Let me go to this passage.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   Let me explain to you this.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.920]   And we'll go over here and answer all your problems and explain to you this."
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.160]   And all of a sudden, that time just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   You know what's going to happen?
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.720]   Even though you can be incredibly helpful to that counselee during that time, and you
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.680]   give them amazing insights into the Word of God to help them with their problem, they're
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.560]   going to be reluctant to come back.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   You know why?
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.080]   Because they remember, "That was a long session.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   That was long."
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   They're going to be really reluctant.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:39.200]   So an hour, an hour and a half at the longest, then cut it off.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.240]   Say, "Hey, we'll pick up there next time."
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.200]   Let them go home and digest what you've given them.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   Don't give them too much.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.880]   I don't care how intelligent they are.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.760]   Don't overload them.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.760]   Just like a baby.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.120]   You feed a child too much, and guess what that child's going to do?
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.560]   They're going to spit it back at you, okay?
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.040]   And that's what these counselees are going to do, too.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:12.400]   You overload them during one session with too much, and they can't handle it.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.760]   They'll lose it.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.160]   You can't do that.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.800]   Jesus understood that.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:23.240]   I mean, you remember how the disciples used to press him about who he was and the aspects
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.240]   of his kingdom?
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.720]   And he kept saying to them, "It's not the right time.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.400]   It's not for you to know now, but later."
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.360]   In other words, what is he doing?
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:42.200]   At the right time, he timed the revelation of himself and his will out even while he
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   walked the earth.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.560]   He didn't give it to them all in one session.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.640]   It's not for you to know this at this particular time, he would say.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   We'll come back.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.760]   We'll re-engage later.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.120]   So be careful of the time in that sense.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:07.960]   It goes without saying, if you're really going to do good counseling, you've got to be friendly,
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.440]   and you've got to be compassionate.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   I like the biblical term for compassion there in Ephesians 4:32, because literally it means
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440]   to be tender-bowled.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:26.560]   That's compassion, tender-bowled.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.920]   The bowels were the seat of the emotions.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:41.320]   So to be tender-bowled meant to be compassionate, to be emotionally compassionate with people.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:52.160]   If we're going to be good counselors, we've got to show people emotionally that we really
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.680]   care for them.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:02.360]   I think this is no better expressed than in Romans 12, if you want to grab your Bible
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:15.640]   and go over there for a moment, Romans chapter 12, and verse 15 where it says, "Rejoice with
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.040]   those who rejoice and weep with those who weep."
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.280]   That's a person who demonstrates emotions.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.120]   It's not bad to show emotions.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:32.040]   There are many, many times I've wept with my counselees, and there are many, many times
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:38.080]   that I have rejoiced with them.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.160]   And you need to do the same thing.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:53.560]   Emotional expressions that are appropriate, not artificial, not fake, but appropriate
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.360]   emotions is the right way to be.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.360]   You've got to be friendly.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.720]   You've got to be compassionate.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.520]   It's very easy, after you've been in the ministry for a little while and worked with real serious
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:12.200]   people problems, to view people as a problem with two legs.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.820]   That's very easy to begin to view them that way.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.400]   They're not a problem with two legs.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.660]   They are people.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.200]   They are people created in the image of God.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.900]   They have emotions like you have emotions.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:33.780]   They have likes and dislikes the way you have likes and dislikes.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:44.040]   In Matthew 6, Jesus talks about that, or actually in Matthew 7, we're supposed to do unto others
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.520]   as you would have them do unto you.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.520]   Why would he say that?
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:58.760]   Because we're really in touch with the way that we want people to treat us.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.080]   We understand that real well.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.640]   I want you to treat me nice.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:11.160]   I want you to give me lots of leeway and lots of mercy and lots of grace because I know
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.560]   I need it.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.680]   Well, that's exactly the way we need to be with other people.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.120]   We need to be friendly and compassionate with them.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.040]   Furthermore, we need to answer questions about counseling.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.320]   Why?
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   What it is?
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.960]   How long is it going to take?
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.280]   What's the purpose of the counseling?
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.400]   Your counselees are going to ask you those questions.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:42.440]   Now, when a person asks me the question, "Why is counseling necessary?"
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:48.160]   I always give them the Galatians 6.1 answer.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.400]   Counseling is necessary because you've been struggling with this thing for a long time
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:36:01.440]   and all your efforts have failed, so you need somebody to come alongside you and help you.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:08.360]   In your marriage, you've been struggling with this particular conflict for a long time and
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.620]   you haven't seen any resolution to this particular problem, then you need somebody to come along
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.760]   and help you.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.440]   When they ask the question, "What is it?
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.160]   What is counseling?"
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:28.600]   Counseling is a process whereby we take the Word of God and use it as a diagnostic tool
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:36.840]   to understand a problem and find the remedy to that problem in the Word of God, and then
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:46.480]   we change our lives accordingly with the ultimate goal of honoring and glorifying the Lord
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.360]   Jesus Christ, becoming Christ-like.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   That's counseling.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.760]   How long will it take?
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:04.000]   Well, I don't know, but most problems, I tell them, usually do not exceed 40 days and 40
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.720]   nights if you're really working on them.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.920]   That's about six weeks.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:15.440]   If you're really working on a serious problem and every week you're doing what needs to
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.880]   be done, most problems can be resolved in about six weeks.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.640]   I would say that that probably is 95% of all the problems that are out there.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:31.400]   Takes about 40 days and 40 nights to resolve that problem.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.000]   But there are some exceptions.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.040]   There are some problems that come up that may take longer, and more often than not,
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   when you start to deal with one particular problem in a person's life, five more show
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.720]   up, maybe even worse.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.160]   So you start to uncover and peel back what's going on in their life, then you find out
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:02.320]   underneath the surface there's a lot more going on here than what I first suspected.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   So then it's going to take a little bit longer.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.600]   You take a particular issue that's happened in a marriage, a husband or wife, or in a
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:20.560]   family between parents and kids, your average problem takes about six weeks, 40 days and
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.960]   40 nights to resolve.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:32.600]   Well furthermore, you need to prepare proper arrangements and materials as well.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:44.280]   When you do a counseling session, it's important that you have at your disposal a Bible, a
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.800]   notepad whereby you can take notes for that counseling session.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.680]   You need to have at your disposal some potential homework assignments.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.160]   In this particular case, dealing with marital problems, then it would be homework assignments
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:09.560]   around marital problems, books that you can recommend that maybe they can read.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.880]   First and foremost, you want to get them into Scripture because that's where their real
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.120]   help and hope is going to come from.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:22.200]   But then there is some, not all, most of the Christian material that's written about counseling
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.800]   that's out there in the Christian bookstore is horrible material.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.600]   It's horrible material because it's written from a Christian psychological standpoint.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.780]   It's not written from a Biblical standpoint.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:40.400]   But as years go by, there's more and more Biblically oriented material out there that's
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.280]   good, that will kind of supplement what the Bible says.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   That's not a good word.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.000]   I don't like to use the word supplement.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.520]   It's not going to supplement it.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:56.760]   It's going to help them see how to use the Word of God better, how the Word of God should
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.600]   change their life, how they should view their problem.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.320]   So you've got to have the proper materials.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.720]   Then you need to prepare your heart by prayer and meditation between your counseling sessions
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.560]   and before you have a counseling session.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.480]   Prepare your heart with prayer and meditation.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.880]   Give directions to the meeting place.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.520]   Make sure they know where to meet.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.220]   It's amazing how sometimes this is left out.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.080]   And then after the initial session and before each subsequent session, record your goals
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.920]   for each upcoming session.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   What are your goals?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.240]   We talked about the importance of goal in the previous class.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.000]   Well, what are they?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.680]   What do you really want to do?
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.600]   Where do you want to take your counselee from here?
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:48.720]   What issues in their life really needs to be addressed biblically?
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:54.640]   Try to enunciate those goals as clearly as possible and you actually end up prioritizing
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.720]   those goals in the process.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:04.520]   Okay, let's move on to our next section here where it talks about determining the session.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:10.360]   Now remember, all of this is a part of setting the proper context for good counseling to
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.360]   occur.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.400]   I'm not going to spend a long time on this.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:23.160]   Some of this is common sense, but other parts of it are oftentimes parts that people neglect
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.720]   and it ends up hurting your counselee.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:30.080]   For example, starting on time.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:38.160]   If you waste a lot of time and you don't start on time, then your counselees will learn.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.800]   Just like I learned as a professor.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.520]   If you don't start a class on time, your students automatically learn, "Hey, listen, I've got
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.880]   10 minutes more," because he's really not going to get started until 10 after.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.040]   So they'll come drifting in later and so you're starting later and later and later and you
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.000]   lose good segments of your class.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.380]   You've got to start on time.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.680]   You've got to start your counseling on time.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.580]   And greet your counselees warmly and enthusiastically.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.560]   Tell them you're really glad they're here.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   And that's not artificial.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.840]   I'm not talking about putting on a fake smile.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.240]   I'm not talking about being overly jovial.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.400]   No, no, no.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.840]   We're talking about letting them know that you believe that there is real hope in this
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:26.080]   session and you're really happy to see them there because you believe the Word of God
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:32.200]   is going to bring about change.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:42.240]   Then always begin and end your counseling sessions with prayer if it is appropriate.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:52.120]   Now there are times where it is not appropriate.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:43:08.100]   For example, if you have a very rebellious teenager in for counseling and they're not
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.200]   in any mood to pray, it's not appropriate to do.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:17.400]   It would be very awkward and everybody's focus is not going to be upon the Lord.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.120]   It's going to be upon that kid and his rebellion.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.960]   But your average counseling session should begin with prayer.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.440]   It's the first thing I always do.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.080]   People come in and have a seat and I say, "It's great to see you.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.200]   I want to really get down and start getting into the Word of God with you.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.200]   Let's have prayer first."
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:43.280]   Okay, so we bow for prayer and then the very next thing after prayer is I take a look at
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   homework.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.000]   "Let's take a look at your homework."
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   So they get into this habit that they know we're going to have prayer and then he's going
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.680]   to look at my homework and I've got to make sure my homework's done.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.960]   And then at the end of the session, I tell them, "Listen, let's bow for prayer.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.400]   Let's commit this session to the Lord."
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   So if it's appropriate, begin and end with prayer.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.480]   Practice all your involvement skills.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:20.280]   That means being kind, gentle with people, personable with them.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:26.640]   Sometimes you have to adapt yourself to the personality and mood of your counselee.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:35.040]   If your counselee comes in really depressed and sad, then you don't want to be overly
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.040]   jovial.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.440]   "How's it going?"
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.800]   No, no, that's just totally inappropriate.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.320]   No.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.880]   You have to match yourself and adapt yourself to your counselee's mood at that moment.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.960]   If they come in and they look like they're down or they're depressed, you say to them,
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.080]   "Hey, Tom, it's good to see you.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.200]   I'm really happy you're here.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.600]   I'm looking forward to getting in the Word of God with you.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.920]   So have a seat.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   Let's talk about this."
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:07.320]   So even though they're depressed and sad, I'm not overly excited, I'm not overly...
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.560]   But I'm adapting myself, but I'm still optimistic.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.640]   I'm not going to buy into their depression and I'm not going to be depressed, too.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:20.600]   If Tom's depressed, I'm not going to act, "Okay, Tom, it's really great to see you today."
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   "Well, there's a lot of hope in that."
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.120]   No, you don't want to do that.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:33.300]   So match yourself, however.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:39.680]   Sometimes you have to mirror their body image or body language, I should say.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:49.080]   Imitate their posture and their gestures and match their tone of voice and their rate.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:54.120]   If you can tell that they're having a slow day and they're having a hard time expressing
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:46:03.840]   themselves, and so they're talking very slowly, then match yourself to that, all right?
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:10.600]   You're not going to try to dump too much on them or talk really fast.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.760]   I think you're exercising true biblical love when you're doing that because you're placing
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:23.360]   their concerns and what's going on in their life above the way you want it to be.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.760]   That's really a Christlike person.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.640]   Now here's a biggie here.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:37.400]   You've got to adapt yourself to their personality and moods, as I say, but also avoid power
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   struggles, adversarial relationships.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:57.520]   Again, this is not a time to say, or even to act like you're going to take sides in
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.400]   this issue.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:07.160]   They'll want you to, they'll try to draw you to their side or their perspective, but you're
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.680]   not going to take any sides except God's, all right?
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.200]   That's the only side that I'm on.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   I'm on God's side.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.640]   I'm not on his side or her side or the kid's side or the parent's side.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.120]   I'm on God's side.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.760]   Sometimes when you take that neutral point of view, most parents working with kids' situation
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:30.160]   always, by virtue of the fact that they are the parents, want me to take the parent's
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   side.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.480]   Well, the parents aren't always right.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:40.800]   There's occasion where the kids are right, and I can't take the parent's side because
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   that's not right.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:53.680]   It's not what the Bible says, but they want you to, but don't get into those power struggles.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.400]   The bottom line is you're really not siding with the kids.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.280]   You're not really siding with the parents.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.760]   You're siding with what God says.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.000]   That's the important thing.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:20.920]   Pace your session rate, that is, to your counselor's ability to follow you fully or pace your session
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.920]   rate.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:31.220]   For example, let's say you have a 70-year-old man who's alert, but he's a little bit slow.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:35.880]   He's not as quick as you're normally used to.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:42.800]   He stumbles around and stutters here and there.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:53.840]   Sometimes you have to, with a person like this, slow down, repeat yourself more often,
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:49:01.600]   review things and clarify things more often than you would do with an average counselee.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.940]   Why?
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.440]   Because that person's a little bit slower.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.640]   How do you find that out?
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:12.760]   One of the best ways to find that out is ask them to read something.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:19.080]   By the way, don't just assume that your counselee can read.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.680]   I've embarrassed people like that.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.480]   I've handed them the Bible and said, "Okay, I want you to read this verse out loud," and
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   they eventually look up to me and they say, "I can't read."
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   Really?
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.480]   Okay.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:45.280]   Well, let's have your spouse read this.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.000]   You've got to pace your session to the counselee's ability to follow you fully.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.120]   Furthermore, you have to pace your session to the amount of time that you have for counseling
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:05.800]   and giving appropriate homework in counseling.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:14.480]   You can say to them, "Listen, I have an hour to spend with you, so I've got to have to
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:21.640]   be careful of my time, and every now and then, I'm going to have to slow you down or ask
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   you to stop."
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:28.080]   In fact, you know what the greatest word in counseling is, don't you?
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.680]   It's "whoa."
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.600]   That's the greatest word in counseling.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.560]   Not "stop it," but "whoa."
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.260]   All right?
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.920]   You say, "Whoa."
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:49.760]   "Whoa" means halt, stop talking, so that...because, you know, there are some people who will talk
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.320]   and talk and talk and talk.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.680]   My mother used to have that expression.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.400]   They go around the barn, around the barn, and around the barn without going in the barn,
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.400]   okay?
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:01.680]   And they just talk, and they review things the same way over and over and over again,
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:08.360]   and they get into this cyclical pattern, and some people's circles are wider than others,
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.320]   so it takes you a while to identify that they're circular in their thinking.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:19.560]   Some people are very narrow little ones, and they keep rehearsing the same things a lot.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.080]   So at some particular point, you say, "Whoa, I've already heard this.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.240]   You've reviewed this already; I understand what you're talking about there.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.120]   Now, I've been listening to you all this time.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.800]   You need to listen to what the Word of God says.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.960]   It's time for you to listen."
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:39.000]   So you get your pen and your notebook out, and we're going to talk over some key passages
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.480]   here in regards to your problem.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.080]   So you have to pace yourself to the amount of time that you have for counseling and giving
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.680]   the appropriate kind of homework.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:59.380]   Don't just use up your entire time just in instruction phase.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:04.120]   You got to leave time to give them good homework and explain to them why you're giving them
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:14.720]   this homework, which says this.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:22.640]   Homework says that counseling is not magic hour of the week.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:29.160]   There are a lot of people who think that counseling is magic hour.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:34.560]   I'm going to go into counseling, and some magical things are going to happen.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.760]   No.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:42.560]   Change occurs not just in counseling, but change occurs every day of the week.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.960]   And homework brings that change into every day of their life.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:55.360]   It teaches them to go to the Word of God to solve their problems every day of the week.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:07.420]   So you give them homework to get them into the Bible every single day of the week.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:14.080]   So change and growth occurs.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:23.320]   Furthermore, avoid at all costs partiality or taking sides.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.420]   Avoid partiality or taking sides.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:26.420]   Why?
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:34.680]   Well, it's just like that passage that I referred to earlier in our class period there in Proverbs
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:41.080]   chapter 18 and verse 17, "The first to plead his case seems right until another comes along
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.800]   and examines him."
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:53.320]   Rarely in any kind of home, family, or marriage problem is it one-sided.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.680]   Rarely is that ever the case.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.900]   You may need to say in an especially tense situation, "Listen, I'm not on Barbara's side
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.720]   and I'm not on Bill's side.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:09.120]   I'm seeking to be on the Lord's side and my goal is to help the two of you to be what
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:16.360]   God wants you to be or to have the marriage that God wants you to have or to have the
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.120]   family and home that God wants you to have.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:24.760]   That's what I'm after."
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:31.720]   So you've got to avoid at all costs partiality and taking sides.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:43.360]   If you are a partial counselor, then people are not going to trust you and they certainly
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.800]   are not going to share the most intimate parts of their lives with you in order to solve
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:53.040]   any problems because they'll consider you to be very, very biased.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.160]   So avoid partiality.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:00.360]   Furthermore, you need to manifest confidence and competence.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.880]   Now this is not in yourself.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.540]   That's what Alfred Adler would say out in the secular counseling world.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.240]   You need to have self-confidence.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.600]   You need to have self-competence.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.000]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:30.480]   I'm talking about manifesting confidence first in the Scriptures.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.440]   Confidence and competence in the Scriptures, that the Scriptures has the answers to this
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.080]   problem.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.480]   I trust the Scriptures.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.160]   In fact, sometimes I'll say to my counselees, "I don't trust me.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:48.920]   If I gave you what John Street had to say about a problem, you're really in trouble.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:57.120]   But if I'm giving you what God says about this problem, now that means you've got hope."
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:05.480]   And you can have assurance that God brings about real change as a result of that.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:14.520]   Furthermore, you need confidence in their ability to change.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:26.120]   That you don't care how deeply ingrained this problem is.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   You don't care how old they are.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:34.040]   They can still change.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.520]   You know, the old man comes in to you for counseling and sits down.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:41.440]   And you start talking with him about the changes that he needs to make in his life.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:48.060]   He says to you, "Well, you can't teach an old dog new tricks."
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.760]   You need to say to him, "You know what?
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.640]   You're right, but you're not a dog.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.800]   You're made in the likeness and image of Jesus Christ.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:02.240]   That means that you have the capacity to change."
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.080]   But he thinks, because of his old age and the fact that this has been a pattern for
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.120]   such a long time, he thinks that he can't change.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.160]   And he can.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:20.000]   Furthermore, because God is in control of these things, you have to manifest confidence
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:38.480]   and competence in the hope for the future because God stands behind this process.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:48.920]   I trust what God is doing.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:58:07.480]   Proverbs 4, verse 18, Solomon here describes, if there ever is an Old Testament
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:13.680]   verse that deals with progressive sanctification, it's got to be this verse.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.860]   But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn that shines brighter and brighter
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.080]   until the full day.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:28.320]   That is a great verse on progressive sanctification.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:35.880]   The path of the righteous, this is where God is leading the righteous, is like the light
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:42.920]   of dawn, like the sun coming up over the horizon that just gets brighter and brighter and brighter
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.360]   as it rises.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:53.680]   That's the way the righteous are.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:04.680]   While we're still in the Old Testament, we can go back to Psalm 119.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:17.320]   In verse 73, "Your hands made me," the psalmist said, "and fashioned me."
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.240]   Give me understanding that I may learn your commands.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:28.780]   Your hands made me, that's in the Hebrew past tense, but the word fashion is the imperfect.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:36.080]   In other words, your hand continues to fashion me.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.800]   God continues to fashion me.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.720]   There's the hope in the future.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.280]   You're manifesting confidence and competence in the hope in the future.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.840]   God is the one who's continuing to work on me.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:59.340]   Here's another great progressive sanctification verse in the Old Testament.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.020]   Let's go over to one other verse in the New Testament.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:15.780]   Let's go to 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:21.440]   Paul expresses this well when he says, "But we all, with unveiled faiths, beholding as
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.300]   in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:37.400]   to glory, just as from the Lord the Spirit."
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:51.400]   So there's the process of progressive sanctification.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.680]   There's a good description of it.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:01:02.720]   So that's the reason why we have faith in the future, or at least in what God is doing
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:11.040]   in the future, or we have hope that God's going to bring about a good result here.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:18.060]   Now next, you also need to be thorough in data gathering.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:23.640]   We're going to talk about more of this a little bit later, but you need to be doing this all
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.540]   the time.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.240]   And of course, prayer is vitally important here.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:35.760]   And we already mentioned Proverbs 18, verse 13, "If a man speaks before he hears, he's
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   a fool."
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.280]   We don't want to do that.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.680]   We want to listen carefully and gather all the data that we can.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:51.520]   One of the ways you can do this is by using good data gathering homework assignments.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.880]   You don't necessarily have to gather all the data during a counseling session.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.640]   If you give good data gathering homework assignments, then that will actually leave you more time
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.320]   for instruction within the counseling session.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:17.080]   So don't spend all your time just data gathering in a session.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.480]   Furthermore, communicate a deep trust in the Lord and the thorough and practical knowledge
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:29.680]   of His Word.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.720]   You need to always have your Bible up in front of you.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.360]   It needs to be open.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.400]   You need to read it regularly in counseling.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:45.000]   You need to have the counselees look up things in their Bible and have them read it in counseling
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.240]   so that they get the idea that the source of your advice and counsel is not your own
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240]   ideas.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   This comes from God.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.480]   It's God's ideas.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.360]   To the degree that you rightly represent what the Bible is saying is the degree at which
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.100]   you have divine power behind your counseling.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:13.480]   That power is the very power of God changing people's lives.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:18.320]   So use the Bible, have your counselees read the Bible.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:25.880]   That's what needs to happen.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:36.760]   Then furthermore, you need to demonstrate good analytic and instructive skills.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:48.540]   Analytic skills are how perceptive you are during the counseling
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:04:00.720]   process with all that data that's coming at you in guiding that process to an efficient
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.280]   and effective end.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.600]   You don't just let it drift and wander.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:15.960]   In the process, you show good analytic skills when you don't allow generalities.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:26.240]   There are some counselees who will say to you, "Well, I don't always treat my wife
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.480]   well."
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.480]   You know how that is.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.480]   You know.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.640]   I usually say to them, "No, I don't know.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   Tell me about that.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.760]   What do you mean by that?"
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.360]   "Well, you know, I don't love her enough."
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.920]   "Well, what does that mean when you say you don't love her enough?"
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.240]   "That's a big, warm, fuzzy.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   For me, not loving her enough?
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.000]   Does that mean you don't emote enough emotionality towards her?"
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.760]   "I love you now."
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   "All right.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.000]   Is that what you're saying?"
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   "Well, no."
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.560]   "Well, then what are you saying?"
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.440]   "I don't do things for her."
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   "Do what?
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440]   Do what?"
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.000]   "I don't help her out around the house very much."
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   "Oh, you mean like picking up after yourself and after other people?"
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   "Oh, yeah.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.440]   I don't do that."
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.440]   "Not helping her with the dishes?"
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.440]   "Oh, yeah.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   I don't do that either."
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.080]   "With all those little projects that she wants you to do and you just totally ignore
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.080]   them?"
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   "Oh, yeah.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.080]   Yeah."
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.080]   All right.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.520]   Now, that's getting down to specifics.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.760]   Don't allow them to exist in generalities.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:41.440]   The more concrete you are, the quicker you're going to see change in your counselee.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.320]   Don't let them...
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.760]   Our old associate pastor, his name is Rick Wilson.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.000]   Rick Wilson used to say, "Get them out of Vegsville and Fuzzy Land."
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   That's a good way to describe them.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.480]   Get them out of Vegsville and Fuzzy Land.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.120]   Don't let them exist in Vegsville and Fuzzy Land.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:06.680]   Don't allow them to use generalities.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.160]   My wife's not submissive.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.000]   What do you mean your wife's not submissive?
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   What is that?
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   That's a big fuzzy for me.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.480]   What does that mean?
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.400]   Force him to describe that.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:24.560]   My husband doesn't love me enough.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.280]   What does that mean?
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   Well, he yells at me all the time.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:35.240]   Well, what does he say?
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:44.000]   My one daughter, I remember she came home from third grade with her third grade teacher
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.360]   saying that her teacher was really, really mean.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:58.960]   And what she meant by that was, "My third grade teacher disagrees with me."
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:03.480]   Sometimes when a wife will say to you in counseling, "My husband yells at me."
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.360]   When you truly try to pin it down, here's a rather, you know, it's not as if this guy's
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.360]   perfect.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.360]   He's not.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.360]   But he's a pretty calm guy.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.640]   He doesn't look like a reactive type.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:21.160]   And if you pin it down, what she really means is, "He disagrees with me."
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.600]   So anytime you disagree with me, you're yelling at me.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:33.280]   No, he's not yelling at her.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.760]   She spends money like it's going out of style, he'll say.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.400]   What does that mean?
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.560]   Well, look at all those groceries.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.000]   Well, do you eat them?
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:55.080]   Well, what are you going to eat if she doesn't buy them?
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:03.160]   It's almost as if he expects her to manufacture her own money to buy these groceries.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.320]   He loves the groceries, but he doesn't want her to spend money.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:11.020]   So what does he want her to do, steal them?
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.720]   She spends money like it's going out of style.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.080]   She's got to buy groceries for you and the family.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.440]   Or she don't allow generalities.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:28.600]   Furthermore, be humble enough to ask for confirmation.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:34.720]   That shows good analytical skills.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.740]   Every now and then, I'll stop a counseling product, you know, all the data that's coming
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.080]   at me, and I'll stop and I'll say, "Listen, let me see if I can summarize what you've
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.760]   been saying up to this particular point, and you correct me where I'm wrong.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.200]   Here's what I hear you saying," and I'll just boil down maybe an hour's worth of information
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.200]   that's come at me.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.120]   I'll boil it down in one or two statements.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.280]   You're saying da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, right?
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.560]   "Well, yeah, but I changed this a little bit."
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   Okay, okay, good.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.760]   So we're on the same page here.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.900]   We got it.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:21.900]   So don't be afraid to ask for confirmation on your own conclusions, and don't jump to
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:25.900]   conclusion with people.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:34.820]   Furthermore, be sure to invite your counselee's corrections.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.760]   You're not a mind reader.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.740]   Just because you have a degree in theology after you get out of seminary doesn't mean
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.340]   that you can read minds.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:49.060]   You can't.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.060]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.060]   Let's go over to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 11.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.380]   Paul talks about mind readers there.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:05.180]   1 Corinthians 2, 11, he says, "For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except for
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:09.060]   the spirit of man which is in him?"
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:14.780]   The obvious answer to that is no one does.
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.780]   Now, there are some women who want to give you the impression that because by virtue
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:27.300]   of the fact that they're female, they have a special ESP, extra-sensory perception.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:31.980]   They don't, all right.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.460]   I just let the cat out of the bag.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.460]   They don't.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:39.860]   They don't have extra-sensory perception because the Bible says, "No man among men knows the
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:44.140]   thoughts of a man except for the spirit of man that is in him."
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.700]   God knows those thoughts.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.860]   Nobody does.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:53.980]   Now, you can use the Bible as a diagnostic tool to say, "I'll bet you thought this because
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.740]   of what you know about what's happening in a problem."
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.500]   And that person will say, "Yeah."
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.300]   Well, it's not because you actually know what's going on in their thoughts.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:10.060]   It's because you know what the Bible says about people who think similarly.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.560]   That's different.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.180]   But no man knows the thoughts of a man.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:16.420]   So you don't know that with your counseling.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:18.620]   So you need to invite their correction.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.820]   Say, you know, I say to them, "I could be wrong, but this is what I think is really
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:28.220]   going on here in your head.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.500]   If I'm wrong, you tell me I'm wrong."
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:36.180]   This is where I believe, by the way, that I think counseling actually makes you into
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.720]   a much better preacher.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.460]   You know why?
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:45.840]   Because you're working with people problems and that starts affecting the way you're putting
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.940]   your sermons together.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:55.340]   And you know how you're really hitting your congregation is when you're done preaching,
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:12:01.700]   people will come up to you and will say to you, "Pastor, did you have a camera in our
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:06.060]   house this week?
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.420]   Were you listening to what we said at our house?
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.420]   Were you eavesdropping?"
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:11.420]   "No."
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:18.680]   "Well, your whole sermon reflected like you knew what was going on in our house this week."
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.780]   You know why?
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:23.280]   Because you work so much with people problems.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.040]   You know how people respond to issues.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.040]   You know how they deal with issues.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.680]   And you've crafted your sermon in such a way that you're speaking to those things.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.880]   "Whoa, that's incredible.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.020]   That's where I live," they're saying.
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:42.440]   Too many guys think that they can kind of prepare their sermons totally detached from
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   their congregation.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.580]   No, no, no.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.760]   That's not a pastor.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   That's a lecturer.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.280]   That's not a pastor.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.060]   He's not pastoring from the pulpit.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:57.360]   He's lecturing from the pulpit.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.760]   Furthermore, be sure to invite your counselees...
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280]   Where am I at here?
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.020]   Be careful about interpreting the influence of the past.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:18.380]   Be careful about interpreting the influence of the past.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:28.760]   In other words, we don't want to become behaviorists where, God bless B.F. Skinner and all of his
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:35.400]   behaviorism on how the environment really ultimately determines a person and the influences
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.400]   of the past and the way that people have been brought up now is determined to the way that
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.880]   they are.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.360]   We don't want to become that way.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   And one of the ways that we can avoid that is by letting the counselee confirm our impressions
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.580]   of what is occurring.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:58.800]   They can confirm that.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.640]   So be careful about interpreting the influence of the past.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:10.060]   We don't want the past to override everything in the present and act as if because you've
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:15.920]   had this past and maybe it's been horrible that that gives you an excuse to act or react
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.920]   the way you are.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   No, no, no.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920]   That's not the case.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.960]   I mean, I don't care what their past has been.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:28.040]   They have choices here and now that they need to make.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.160]   They're not determined by their past.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.940]   They can be influenced by it, but they're not determined by it.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.780]   So those are some of the analytical skills.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.720]   What are the instructional skills?
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.000]   Let me go through a few of these rather quickly.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.040]   Good counselor uses figures of speech, metaphors, and illustrations abundantly.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.320]   Don't be afraid to do that as long as they're appropriate.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.320]   Use scripture and let them read the scripture frequently.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.880]   Use diagrams.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.760]   Write them on a whiteboard.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.560]   I always, when I do counseling, I always have a whiteboard handy.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.520]   Somehow people remember things when you are able to use diagrams.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:33.740]   For example, I'll talk about a husband and a wife, and I'll talk about the fact that
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:46.100]   they have a relationship to God, and the closer they are in their relationship to God, the
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.380]   closer they are going to be to one another.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.940]   I want them to see that.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:56.660]   The closer that they have their relationship to God, the closer they're going to be to
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:59.100]   one another.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:03.300]   Or we'll talk about the conscience, and I'll say to them, "Imagine that the conscience
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:16.500]   is like a triangle, and every time you sin, that triangle spins, and these little edges
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:22.820]   of this triangle prick your conscience.
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:23.820]   You feel it.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:31.580]   You feel bad because you know you've sinned, but you can also sin to the point where you
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:41.220]   wear those points off of your triangle, and even though you're still sinning, and that
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.100]   thing's still spinning, you don't feel it any longer.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:53.660]   Then you have what the Bible calls a seared conscience, a hard conscience, a conscience
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:58.060]   that doesn't feel any longer.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:04.060]   You've done this to your wife, or to your husband so much, you don't even feel bad about
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:07.500]   it anymore.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:12.940]   That's where your conscience has been seared, and it's going to require going back to the
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:19.300]   Word of God, and allowing the Word of God to retrain your conscience and sharpen it
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:28.660]   so that it is sharp again, so that it'll prick you again every time you sin, so that you'll
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.620]   feel bad about it.
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:35.140]   Now, when you use illustrations like that, and you just put them on the board, somehow
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.140]   they remember it.
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:39.780]   I mean, several weeks later, they'll say to you as a counselor, "You remember when you
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:40.860]   put that thing on the board?
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.420]   I can remember what you said about that."
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:47.800]   They could describe the whole thing to you, and all you did was draw a little simple picture.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.180]   That's all you did, but they remembered that.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:58.700]   They heard you describe it, they saw you write it, it made sense to them, so don't be afraid
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.860]   to do that.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:05.220]   Use diagrams, all that you can do.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:08.660]   Also use a lot of open-ended questions, not closed questions.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:14.180]   Closed questions only seek a yes or no type of answer.
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:20.380]   Open questions, they have to think about how they're going to answer.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:28.260]   So use yes or no questions, or open questions, not yes or no questions.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:32.660]   Furthermore, use role play strategies.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.580]   I'll do that frequently in counseling as well.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:42.020]   I'll assume the role of a husband or a wife, and then I'll ask them, let's say we have
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:52.540]   Bill or Barbara, I'll say to Barbara, "Okay, Barbara, when Bill says that to you, how do
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:54.500]   you think you should respond?
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:59.580]   Remember, you told me that your response was one of anger.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:06.200]   You got really angry with Bill when he does that to you.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.900]   How should you have responded?"
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.380]   She sits there and says, "I'm not sure."
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:21.940]   And I'll say to her, "Okay, Barbara, you become Bill, and I'll be Barbara.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:25.980]   You react to me the way you see Bill reacting to you."
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:28.180]   So she does.
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.440]   And then I say, "Okay, now I'm you.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.300]   How am I going to respond to Bill?"
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:38.400]   "Bill, I don't like the way you're doing.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.420]   This is not nice.
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.420]   But you know what?
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:47.780]   I love you, and I want to work things out with you, and I think that would be most honoring
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.340]   to God."
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:54.620]   At this particular point, Barbara's got a big smile on her face just like you do, all
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:55.620]   right?
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.620]   But I'll do that in counseling.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.660]   I'll just play out the role.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:05.380]   And I'll give them ways that they can respond in a more godly fashion to one another.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:12.100]   And when I do that, it's incredibly memorable for them, all right?
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:19.620]   They'll remember that, and they'll take it home and use it, that somehow that sticks.
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.020]   So role play with them.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.220]   Switch roles.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.920]   Go back and forth.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:28.220]   Teach them how they should be responding.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:35.260]   You see, that's when you are doing more than just dumping the Bible on them.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:39.420]   You're training them in righteousness.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.880]   And that's what we want to do.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.040]   We want to train people in righteousness.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:58.860]   So use role play strategies in order to help them.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.060]   Furthermore, use worst case scenarios.
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:08.860]   What's the worst thing that can happen to you, Bill, in your marital situation?
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.180]   Well, he said, "Barbara could divorce me."
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:17.740]   Well, that would be terrible, but that's not the worst thing that could happen.
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.380]   "Well, she could take the kids."
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:24.260]   Well, that'd be horrible, too, but that's not the worst thing that could happen.
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.020]   He says, "Well, what could be worse than that?"
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:30.700]   I said, "Well, there's something worse than that.
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:35.620]   She could get really angry at me and shoot me."
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.820]   Well, that would be horrible.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:44.140]   If you died, I no longer have a counselee.
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:47.140]   But there's something worse than that.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:51.060]   Bill goes, "If I were to die, there's something worse than that?"
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.260]   "Oh, yeah, absolutely."
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:59.340]   Okay, what?
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:09.660]   If you were to dishonor God in this situation, that's worse than death itself.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.700]   Worst case scenario.
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.140]   What's a worst case scenario?
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:15.380]   What's really important?
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:24.380]   Is obeying God more important than life itself?
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:35.180]   If it's not, then all those martyrs in past Christian histories died for nothing.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.500]   What's more important?
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.100]   What's the worst thing that can happen?
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:45.300]   Use your counselee's involvement in readings and responding to questions and opinions.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:50.700]   Use a lot of encouragement there.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:56.460]   Make plans and follow an agenda, but be ready to scrap them, because you may have plans
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:02.580]   for a counseling session, and your counselees come in with some pressing issue that came
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:06.020]   up that week that changes the course of this a little bit.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:12.740]   Well, put out that little fire, and then go back to your original plan.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.180]   Be appropriately open.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:18.820]   Share your own life with them, how God has worked in your life.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:21.780]   And you can use self-disclosure, but make sure it's appropriate.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:25.980]   You don't want to glorify sin.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:30.140]   We can spend so much time talking about how God has worked in our lives, and how God has
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.860]   worked through sin in our life.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.660]   You don't want to glorify sin.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:39.540]   Or do you want to give the counselee some kind of sense that, "Well, you know, I guess
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:45.420]   my counselor participated in that sin, and he's turned out okay, so it's okay for me
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:49.300]   to get involved in that sin, because I can turn out okay, too."
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.500]   No, you don't want to give them that sense.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:58.380]   Keep momentum up by open-ended questions, by stimulating them to analysis, too.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:02.500]   The best kind of counselee you can have is a thinking counselee, when they're using the
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:14.900]   Word of God and applying it to their problem, and they're thinking about it carefully.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:17.180]   Don't give the impression you're in a hurry.
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.700]   Don't do that, because that just undermines hope.
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:30.140]   Be appropriately authoritative and directive, as Titus 2:15 says.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:40.140]   You can speak the Word in power, but you need to be appropriate with that as well.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:47.020]   And then allow yourself to identify with and personally experience their pain.
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:53.060]   That's what Paul said there in Acts 20, 31, how for night and day, he didn't cease to
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:25:00.740]   aneuthetao each one of them in tears, admonish them with tears.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:04.940]   He was able to experience their pain.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:22.520]   You can see the same thing there that we saw in the Romans 12 passage.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:28.220]   In verse 15, he says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep."
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:37.700]   So allow yourself to identify with and personally experience their pain.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:42.540]   You'll gain a lot of involvement with your counselees if you're able to do that.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.540]   "
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:44.540]   "
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:45.540]   Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:45.540]   You'll gain a lot of involvement with your counselees if you're able to do that.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:51.540]   "
