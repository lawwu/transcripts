[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   The following is a conversation with S. James Gates Jr.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.360]   He's a theoretical physicist
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.320]   and professor at Brown University,
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.840]   working on supersymmetry, supergravity,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.440]   and superstring theory.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.240]   He served on former President Obama's Council
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.520]   of Advisors on Science and Technology,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.320]   and he's now the co-author of a new book
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.600]   titled "Proving Einstein Right"
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.920]   about the scientists who set out to prove
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.520]   Einstein's theory of relativity.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.440]   You may have noticed that I've been speaking
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.240]   with not just computer scientists,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.480]   but philosophers, mathematicians, physicists,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.200]   economists, and soon, much more.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.040]   To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.360]   bigger than computing.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.160]   It is our civilization's journey
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.080]   into understanding the human mind
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.760]   and creating echoes of it in the machine.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.600]   That journey includes, of course,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360]   the world of theoretical physics
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.400]   and its practice of first principles mathematical thinking
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.700]   and exploring the fundamental nature of our reality.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.800]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.720]   give it five stars on Apple Podcasts,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.440]   follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.520]   @LexFriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.760]   If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.440]   or YouTube or Twitter, consider mentioning ideas,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.640]   people, topics you find interesting.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.200]   It helps guide the future of this podcast.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.800]   But in general, I just love comments
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.760]   that are full of kindness and thoughtfulness in them.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.920]   This podcast is a side project for me,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.880]   but I still put a lot of effort into it.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.040]   So the positive words of support
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.880]   from an amazing community, from you, really help.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.560]   I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.200]   I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.800]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.000]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.440]   I hope that works for you
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.720]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.400]   I provide timestamps for the start of the conversations
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.960]   you may have noticed that you can skip to,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200]   but it helps if you listen to the ad
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.880]   and support this podcast by trying out the product
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.440]   or service being advertised.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.680]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.200]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.600]   I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.440]   but you can also use it to buy, sell,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.880]   and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.800]   Cash App also has a new investing feature.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.000]   You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.320]   no matter what the stock price is,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.160]   broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.200]   a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.160]   I'm excited to be working with Cash App
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.320]   to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.680]   best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.160]   They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.960]   in over 110 countries
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.360]   and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.680]   which means the donated money
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.200]   is used to maximum effectiveness.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.040]   When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.760]   and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.600]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.480]   which again is an organization
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   to dream of engineering a better world.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.680]   And now here's my conversation with S. James Gates Jr.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.520]   You tell a story when you were eight,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.240]   you had a profound realization that the stars in the sky
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.560]   are actually places that we could travel to one day.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   Do you think human beings will ever venture
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.280]   outside our solar system?
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.000]   - Wow, the question of whether humanity
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.560]   gets outside of the solar system.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.800]   It's gonna be a challenge.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.320]   And as long as the laws of physics that we have today
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   are accurate and valid,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.880]   it's gonna be extraordinarily difficult.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.460]   I'm a science fiction fan, as you probably know.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.600]   So I love to dream of starships
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.200]   and traveling to other solar systems,
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.520]   but the barriers are just formidable.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   - If we just kind of venture a little bit
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.040]   into science fiction, do you think the spaceships,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.480]   if we are successful, that take us outside the solar system
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.080]   will look like the ones we have today?
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.520]   Or are fundamental breakthroughs necessary?
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.200]   - In order to have genuine starships,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.960]   probably some really radical views
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.040]   about the way the universe works
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.960]   are going to have to take place in our science.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.320]   We could, with our current technology,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.560]   think about constructing multi-generational starships
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.320]   where the people who get on them
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.820]   are not the people who get off at the other end.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.200]   But even if we do that,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.560]   the formidable problem is actually our bodies,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.160]   which doesn't seem to be conscious for a lot of people.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.040]   Even getting to Mars is gonna present this challenge
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.360]   because we live in this wonderful home,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.720]   has a protective magnetic magnetosphere around it,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.920]   and so we're shielded from cosmic radiation.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.800]   Once you leave the shield,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.720]   there are some estimates that, for example,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.280]   if you sent someone to Mars,
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.440]   with our technology, probably about two years out there
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.960]   without the shield, they're gonna be bombarded.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.160]   That means radiation, probably means cancer.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.840]   So that's one of the most formal challenges,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.260]   even if we could get over the technology.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.320]   - Do you think, so Mars is a harsh place.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.200]   Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other folks, NASA,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.880]   are really pushing to put a human being on Mars.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.080]   Do you think, again, forgive me for lingering
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.240]   in science fiction land for a little bit,
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.360]   do you think one day we may be able to colonize Mars?
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.760]   First, do you think we'll put a human on Mars,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.680]   and then do you think we'll put many humans on Mars?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.460]   - So first of all, I am extraordinarily convinced
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.080]   we will not put a human on Mars by 2030,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.920]   which is a date that you often hear in the public debate.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.480]   - What's the challenge there?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.320]   What do you think?
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.560]   - So there are a couple of ways that I could slice this,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.840]   but the one that I think is simplest
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.960]   for people to understand involves money.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.400]   So you look at how we got to the moon in the 1960s.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.260]   It was about 10 year duration between the challenge
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.240]   that President Kennedy laid out
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.640]   and our successfully landing a moon.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.320]   I was actually here at MIT
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.520]   when that first moon landing occurred,
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.240]   so I remember watching it on TV.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.160]   But how did we get there?
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.440]   Well, we had this extraordinarily technical agency
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.880]   of the United States government, NASA.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   It consumed about 5% of the country's economic output.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.780]   And so you say 5% of the economic output
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.400]   over about a 10 year period gets us 250,000 miles in space.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.480]   Mars is about 100 times farther.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.520]   So you have at least 100 times the challenge,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.640]   and we're spending about 1/10 of the funds
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.800]   that we spent then as a government.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.360]   So my claim is that it's at least 1,000 times harder
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.000]   for me to imagine us getting to Mars by 2030.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.400]   - And he had that part that you mentioned in the speech
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.880]   that I just have to throw in there of JFK,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.120]   of we do these things not because they're easy,
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.840]   but because they're hard.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.080]   That's such a beautiful line
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.880]   that I would love to hear a modern president say
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   about a scientific endeavor.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.360]   - Well, one day we live and hope
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.620]   that such a president will arise for our nation.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.120]   But even if, like I said,
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.920]   even if you fix the technical problems,
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   the biological engineering that I worry most about,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.980]   however, I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.980]   I think that by 2090 or so, or 2100,
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.400]   or sometimes I say 120,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.040]   I suspect we're gonna have a human on Mars.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.400]   - Wow, so you think that many years out,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.040]   first a few tangents.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.080]   You said bioengineering is a challenge.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.400]   What's the challenge there?
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   - So as I said, the real problem with interstellar travel,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.780]   aside from the technology challenges,
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.240]   the real problem is radiation.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   And how do you engineer either an environment or a body,
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.880]   because we see rapid advances going on in bioengineering.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.440]   How do you engineer either a ship or a body
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   so that something, some person that's recognizably human
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.620]   will survive the rigors of interplanetary space travel?
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.840]   It's much more difficult
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.180]   than most people seem to take into account.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.540]   - So if we could linger on the 2090, 2100, 2120,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.920]   sort of thinking of that kind of,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.880]   and let's linger on money.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.720]   - Okay.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   - So Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are pushing the cost,
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.680]   trying to push the cost down.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.960]   I mean, this is, so do you have hope,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.400]   as this actually a sort of a brilliant big picture scientist,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   do you think a business entrepreneur can take science
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.920]   and make it cheaper and get it out there faster?
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.840]   - So bending the cost curve,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.560]   you'll notice that has been an anchor.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.720]   This is the simplest way for me to discuss this with people
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.160]   about what the challenge is.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.280]   So yes, bending the cost curve is certainly critical
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   if we're going to be successful.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.960]   Now, you ask about the endeavors that are out there now,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.400]   sponsored by two very prominent American citizens,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.120]   Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.720]   I'm disappointed actually in what I see
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.280]   in terms of the routes that are being pursued.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.800]   So let me give you one example there,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.680]   and this one is going to be a little bit more technical.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.480]   So if you look at the kinds of rockets
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.160]   that both these organizations are creating,
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.360]   yes, it's wonderful reusable technology
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.040]   to see a rocket go up and land on its fins,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.840]   just like it did in science fiction movies when I was a kid.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.520]   That's astounding.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.960]   But the real problem is those rockets,
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.360]   the technology that we're doing now
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.160]   is not really that different
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.440]   than what was used to go to the moon.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.600]   And there are alternatives, it turns out.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.480]   There's an engine called a flare engine, which,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.000]   so a traditional rocket,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.240]   if you look at the engine, it looks like a bell, right?
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.000]   And then the flame comes out the bottom.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.400]   But there is a kind of engine called a flare engine,
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.280]   which is essentially, when you look at it,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.120]   it looks like an exhaust pipe on like a fancy car
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.720]   that's long and elongated.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.880]   And it's a type of rocket engine that we know,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   we know if there've been preliminary testing,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.200]   we know it works.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.800]   And it also is actually much more economical
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.840]   because what it does is allow you
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.040]   to vary the amount of thrust as you go up
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.320]   in a way that you cannot do
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.400]   with one of these bell-shaped engines.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.920]   So you would think that an entrepreneur
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.640]   might try to have the breakthrough
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.080]   to use flare nozzles, as they're called,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.720]   as a way to bend the cost curve.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.280]   As we keep coming back, that's gonna be a big factor.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.640]   But that's not happening.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   In fact, what we see is what I think of as incremental change
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.280]   in terms of our technology.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.280]   So I'm not really very encouraged by what I personally see.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.600]   - So incremental change won't bend the cost curve.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.240]   - I don't see it.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.480]   - Just linger on the sci-fi for one more question.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.000]   - Sure.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.960]   - Do you think we're alone in the universe?
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.840]   Are we the only intelligent form of life?
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.080]   - So there is a quote by Carl Sagan,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.400]   which I really love when I hear this question.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.040]   And I recall the quote, and it goes something like,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.480]   "If we're the only conscious life in the universe,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.920]   "it's a terrible waste of space."
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.080]   Because the universe is an incredibly big place.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.280]   And when Carl made that statement,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.520]   we didn't know about the profusion of planets
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.760]   that are out there.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.240]   In the last decade, we've discovered over 1,000 planets,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.720]   and a substantial number of those planets are Earth-like
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.260]   in terms of being in the Goldilocks zone, as it's called.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.260]   So it's, in my mind, it's practically inconceivable
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.560]   that we're the only conscious form of life in the universe.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.980]   But that doesn't mean they've come to visit us.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.160]   - Do you think they would look,
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.340]   do you think we'll recognize alien life if we saw it?
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.320]   Do you think it'd look anything like the carbon-based,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.240]   the biological system we have on Earth today?
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.280]   - It would depend on that life's native environment
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.720]   in which it arose.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.440]   If that environment was sufficiently like our environment,
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.400]   there's a principle in biology and nature called convergence
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.480]   which is that even if you have two biological systems
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.760]   that are totally separated from each other,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.120]   if they face similar conditions,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.560]   nature tends to converge on solutions.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.440]   And so there might be similarities if this alien life form
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.960]   was born in a place that's kind of like this place.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.760]   - Physics appears to be quite similar,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.060]   the laws of physics across the entirety of the universe.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.040]   Do you think weirder things than we see on Earth
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.440]   can spring up out of the same kinds of laws of physics?
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.960]   - From the laws of physics, I would say yes.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.660]   First of all, if you look at carbon-based life,
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.720]   why are we carbon-based?
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.360]   Well, it turns out it's because of the way
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.280]   that carbon interacts with elements,
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.340]   which in fact is also a reflection
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.800]   on the electronic structure of the carbon nucleus.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.360]   So you can look down the table of elements and say,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.520]   well, gee, do we see similar elements?
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.600]   The answer is yes.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.320]   And one that one often hears about
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.360]   in science fiction is silicon.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.720]   So maybe there's a silicon-based life form out there
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.400]   if the conditions are right.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.220]   But I think it's presumptuous of us to think
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.220]   that we are the template by which all life has to appear.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:53.060]   - Before we dive into beautiful details,
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.380]   let me ask a big question.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.340]   What to you is the most beautiful idea,
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.220]   maybe the most surprising, mysterious idea in physics?
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.660]   - The most surprising idea to me
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.940]   is that we can actually do physics.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.060]   The universe did not have to be constructed
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.940]   in such a way that our,
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.840]   with our limited intellectual capacity,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.820]   that is actually put together in such a way
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.420]   and that we are put together in such a way
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.400]   that we can, with our mind's eye,
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.760]   delve incredibly deeply into the structure of the universe.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.140]   That to me is pretty close to a miracle.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.620]   - So there's simple equations, relatively simple,
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.620]   that can describe things, the fundamental functions,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.800]   that can describe everything about our reality.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.280]   That's not, can you imagine universes
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.100]   where everything is a lot more complicated?
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.720]   Do you think there's something inherent about universes
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.760]   that simple laws are--
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.120]   - Well, first of all, let me,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.680]   this is a question that I encounter in a number of guides
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.480]   is a lot of people will raise the question
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.280]   about whether mathematics is the language of the universe.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.420]   And my response is mathematics is the language
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.960]   that we humans are capable of using in describing universe.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.560]   It may have little to do with the universe,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.900]   but in terms of our capacity, it's the microscope,
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.000]   it's the telescope through which we,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.600]   it's the lens through which we are able to view the universe
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.860]   with the precision that no other human language allows.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.120]   So could there be other universes?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.600]   Well, I don't even know if this one
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.040]   looks like I think it does.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.000]   - But the beautiful, surprising thing is that
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.980]   physics, there are laws of physics,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.820]   very few laws of physics that can effectively compress
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.380]   down the functioning of the universe.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.820]   - Yes, that's extraordinarily surprising.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.100]   I like to use the analogy with computers
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.940]   and information technology.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.140]   If you worry about transmitting large bundles of data,
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.340]   one of the things that computer scientists do for us
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.500]   is they allow for processes that are called compression,
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.060]   where you take big packets of data
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.500]   and you press them down into much smaller packets
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.620]   and then you transmit those
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.540]   and then unpack them at the other end.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.160]   And so it looks a little bit to me
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.680]   like the universe has kind of done us a favor.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.760]   It's constructed our minds in such a way
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.300]   that we have this thing called mathematics,
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.920]   which then as we look at the universe,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.520]   teaches us how to carry out the compression process.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.720]   - A quick question about compression.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.300]   Do you think the human mind can be compressed?
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.220]   The biology can be compressed.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.180]   We talked about space travel.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.620]   To be able to compress the information
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.140]   that captures some large percent of what it means
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.460]   to be me or you and then be able to send that
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.620]   at the speed of light.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.420]   - Wow, that's a big question.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.060]   And let me try to take it apart,
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.040]   unpack it into several pieces.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.880]   I don't believe that wetware biology such as we are
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   has an exclusive patent on intellectual consciousness.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.620]   I suspect that other structures in the universe
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.820]   are perfectly capable of producing the data streams
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.380]   that we use to process, first of all,
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.000]   our observations of the universe
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.780]   and an awareness of ourself.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.420]   I can imagine other structures can do that also.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.660]   So that's part of what you were talking about,
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.620]   which I would have some disagreement with.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.660]   - Consciousness.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.500]   - Yes.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.400]   - That's the most interesting part of--
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.240]   - Consciousness?
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.100]   - Of us humans is consciousness is the thing--
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.020]   - I think that's the most interesting thing about humans.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.760]   - And then you're saying that there's other entities
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.140]   throughout the universe.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.220]   - I can well imagine that the architecture
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.300]   that supports our consciousness,
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.840]   again, has no patent on consciousness.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.700]   - Just in case you have an interesting thought here,
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.540]   there's folks perhaps in philosophy called panpsychics
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.140]   that believe consciousness underlies everything.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.060]   It is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.780]   Do you have a sense that that could possibly fit into--
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.020]   - I don't know the answer to that question.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.780]   One part of that belief system is ghea,
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.500]   which is that there's a kind of conscious life force
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.260]   about our planet.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.820]   And I've encountered these things before.
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.180]   I don't quite know what to make of them.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:30.180]   My own life experience, and I'll be 69 in about two months,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.020]   and I have spent all my adulthood thinking about
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.420]   the way that mathematics interacts with nature
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.780]   and with us to try to understand nature.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.920]   And all I can tell you from all of my integrated experience
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.380]   is that there is something extraordinarily mysterious
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.620]   to me about our universe.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.140]   This is something that Einstein said
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.740]   from his life experience as a scientist.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.740]   And this mysteriousness almost feels
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.380]   like the universe is our parent.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.380]   It's a very strange thing perhaps to hear scientists say,
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.180]   but there are just so many strange coincidences
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.580]   that you just get a sense that something is going on.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.780]   - Well, I interrupted you in terms of compressing
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.900]   what we're down to a consented at the speed of light.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.620]   - Yes, so the first thing is I would argue
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.240]   that it's probably very likely
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.500]   that artificial intelligence ultimately will develop
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.660]   something like consciousness,
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.300]   something that for us will probably be indistinguishable
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.540]   from consciousness.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.540]   So that's what I meant by our biological processing equipment
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.180]   that we carry up here probably does not hold a patent
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.420]   on consciousness because it's really about the data streams.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.580]   I mean, as far as I can tell, that's what we are.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.780]   We are self-actuating, self-learning data streams.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.300]   That to me is the most accurate way I can tell you
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.740]   what I've seen in my lifetime about what humans are
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.260]   at the level of consciousness.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.580]   So if that's the case, then you just need to have
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.640]   an architecture that supports that information processing.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.060]   So let's assume that that's true,
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.620]   that in fact what we call consciousness
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.240]   is really about a very peculiar kind of data stream.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.420]   If that's the case, then if you can export that
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.540]   to a piece of hardware, something metal,
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.500]   electronic, what have you, then you certainly will,
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.460]   ultimately that kind of consciousness
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.620]   could get to Mars very quickly.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.060]   It doesn't have our problems.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.420]   You can engineer the body.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.740]   As I said, it's a ship or a body,
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.980]   you engineer one or both.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.860]   Send it at a speed of light.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.100]   Well, that one is a more difficult one
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.740]   because that now goes beyond just a matter
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.740]   of having a data stream.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.800]   It's now the preservation of the information
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.140]   in the data stream.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.860]   And so unless you can build something
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.500]   that's like a super, super, super version
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.820]   of the way the internet works,
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.100]   'cause most people aren't aware that the internet itself
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.740]   is actually a miracle, it's based on a technology
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.340]   called message packaging.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.300]   So if you could exponentiate message packaging
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.940]   in some way to preserve the information
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.180]   that's in the data stream,
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.900]   then maybe your dream becomes true.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.940]   - Can we, you mentioned with artificial intelligence,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.940]   sort of us human beings not having
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.460]   a monopoly on consciousness.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.460]   Does the idea of artificial intelligence systems,
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.860]   computational systems, being able to basically
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.280]   replacing us humans, scare you, excite you?
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.120]   What do you think about that?
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.500]   - So I'm gonna tell you about a conversation
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.500]   I once had with Eric Schmidt.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.760]   I was sitting at a meeting with him
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.540]   and he was a few feet away.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.260]   And he turned to me and he said something like,
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.220]   you know Jim, in maybe a decade or so,
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.660]   we're gonna have computers that do what you do.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.220]   And my response was not unless they can dream.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.220]   Because there's something about the way that we humans
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.820]   actually generate creativity.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.340]   It's somehow, I get this sense of my lived experience
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.020]   in watching creative people,
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.700]   that it's somehow connected to the irrational parts
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.100]   of what goes on in our head.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.040]   And dreaming is part of that irrational.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.780]   So unless you can build a piece of artificial intelligence
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.780]   that dreams, I have a strong suspicion
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.620]   that you will not get something that will fully be conscious
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.820]   by a definition that I would accept, for example.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.460]   - So you mentioned dreaming.
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.380]   You've played around with some out there fascinating ideas.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.940]   How do you think, and we'll start diving into
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.780]   the world of the very small ideas of supersymmetry
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.460]   and all that, in terms of visualization,
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.540]   in terms of how do you think about it,
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.340]   how do you dream of it, how do you come up with ideas
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.900]   in that fascinating, mysterious space?
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.660]   - So in my workspace, which is basically
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:59.660]   where I am charged with coming up on a mathematical palette
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.860]   with new ideas that will help me understand
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.120]   the structure of nature and hopefully help all of us
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.700]   understand the structure of nature,
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.660]   I've observed several different ways
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.100]   in which my creativity expresses itself.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.500]   There's one mode which looks pretty normal,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.060]   which I sort of think of as the Chinese water torture method
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.620]   where you just drop, drop, drop,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.060]   you get more and more information,
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.660]   and suddenly it all congeals and you get a clear picture.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.620]   And so that's kind of a standard way of working.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.060]   And I think that's how most people think about
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.100]   the way technical people solve problems,
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.180]   that it's kind of you accumulate this body of information
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.700]   and at a certain point you synthesize it
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.620]   and then boom, there's something new.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.260]   But I've also observed in myself and other scientists
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.980]   that there are other ways that we are creative.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.700]   And these other ways to me are actually far more powerful.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.980]   I first personally experienced this
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.980]   when I was a freshman at MIT,
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.960]   over in Baker House right across the campus.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   And I was in a calculus course, 1801 is called at MIT.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.260]   And calculus comes in two different flavors.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.420]   One of them is called differential calculus.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.040]   The other is called integral calculus.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.100]   Differential calculus is the calculus
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.860]   that Newton invented to describe motion.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.860]   It turns out integral calculus was probably invented
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.340]   about 1700 years earlier by Archimedes,
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.940]   but we didn't know that when I was a freshman.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.140]   But so that's what you study as a student.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.940]   And the differential calculus part of the course was,
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.260]   to me, I wouldn't, how do I say this?
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.980]   It was something that by the drip, drip, drip method
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.340]   you could sort of figure it out.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.580]   Now the integral part of calculus,
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.500]   I could memorize the formula, that was not the formula,
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.180]   that was not the problem.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.740]   The problem was why, in my own mind,
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.020]   why do these formulae work?
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.780]   And because of that, when I was in the part
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.460]   of the calculus course where we had to do
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.940]   multiple substitutions to solve integrals,
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.300]   I had a lot of difficulty.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.760]   I was emotionally involved in my education
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.500]   because this is where I think the passion
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.940]   and emotion comes to.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.100]   And it caused an emotional crisis
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.620]   that I was having these difficulties
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.300]   understanding the integral part of calculus.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.140]   - The why of it.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.460]   - The why, that's right, the why of it.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.580]   Not the rote memorization of fact,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.500]   but the why of it, why does this work?
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.820]   And so one night I was over in my dormitory room
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.100]   in Baker House, I was trying to do a calculus problem set.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.580]   I was getting nowhere.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.060]   I got a terrific headache.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.860]   I went to sleep and had this very strange dream.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.980]   And when I awakened, I could do three and four
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.500]   substitutions and integrals with relative ease.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.460]   Now this to me was an astounding experience
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.620]   because I had never before in my life understood
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.020]   that one's subconscious is actually capable
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.020]   of being harnessed to do mathematics.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.940]   I experienced this, and I've experienced this
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.140]   more than once, so this was just the first time
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.760]   why I remember it so.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.860]   So that's why when it comes to really wickedly
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.060]   tough problems, I think that the kind of creativity
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.340]   that you need to solve them is probably
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.440]   this second variety which comes somehow from dreaming.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.340]   - Do you think, again, I told you I'm Russian,
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.820]   so we romanticize suffering, but do you think
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.140]   part of that equation is the suffering
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.660]   leading up to that dreaming?
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.460]   - So the suffering is, I am convinced
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.380]   that this kind of creative, this second mode
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.500]   of creativity as I like to call it,
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.340]   I'm convinced that this second mode of creativity
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.340]   is in fact that suffering is a kind of crucible
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.540]   that triggers it because the mind I think
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.340]   is struggling to get out of this,
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.220]   and the only way to get out of this
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.980]   is to actually solve the problem.
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.780]   And even though you're not consciously solving problems,
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.180]   something is going on, and I've talked about,
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.660]   to a few other people, and I've heard
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.020]   other similar stories, and so I guess the way
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.220]   I think about it is it's a little bit like
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.060]   the way that thermonuclear weapons work.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.580]   I don't know if you know how they work,
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.940]   but a thermonuclear weapon is actually two bombs.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.540]   There's an atomic bomb which sort of does a compression,
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.260]   and then you have a fusion bomb that goes off,
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.540]   and somehow that emotional pressure I think
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.260]   acts like the first stage of a thermonuclear weapon.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.340]   That's when we get really big thoughts.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.740]   - The analogy between thermonuclear weapons
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.000]   and the subconscious, the connection there is,
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.700]   at least visually, is kind of interesting.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.940]   There may be, Freud would have a few things to say.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.580]   - Well, part of it is probably based
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.420]   on my own trajectory through life.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.980]   My father was in the US Army for 27 years,
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.660]   and so I started my life out on military basis,
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.060]   and so a lot of probably the things
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.860]   that wander around in my subconscious
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.580]   are connected to that experience.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.900]   - I apologize for all the tangents, but--
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.100]   - Well, you're doing it.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.220]   (laughing)
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.660]   - But you're encouraging by answering the stupid questions.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.860]   - No, they're not stupid.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.380]   - You know, your father was in the Army.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:19.300]   What do you think about, Neil deGrasse Tyson
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.060]   recently wrote a book on interlinking
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:28.540]   the progress of science to sort of
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.900]   the aspirations of our military endeavors
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.100]   and DARPA funding and so on.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.020]   What do you think about war in general?
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.100]   Do you think we'll always have war?
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.140]   Do you think we'll always have conflict in the world?
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.820]   - I'm not sure that we're going to be able
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.620]   to afford to have war always, because if--
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.220]   - Strictly financially speaking?
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.380]   - No, not in terms of finance, but in terms of consequences.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.100]   So if you look at technology today,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.580]   you can have non-state actors acquire technology,
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.260]   for example, bioterrorism, whose impact
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.860]   is roughly speaking equivalent to what it used
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.740]   to take nations to impart on a population.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.420]   I think the cost of war is ultimately,
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.900]   it's going to be a little, I think it's going to work
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.820]   a little bit like the Cold War.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.740]   You know, we survived 50, 60 years as a species
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.820]   with these weapons that are so terrible
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.300]   that they could have actually ended
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.980]   our form of life on this planet, but it didn't.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.140]   Why didn't it?
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.060]   Well, it's a very bizarre and interesting thing,
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.460]   but it was called mutually assured destruction.
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.460]   And so the cost was so great that people eventually
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.500]   figured out that you can't really use these things,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.100]   which is kind of interesting, 'cause if you read
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.620]   the history about the development of nuclear weapons,
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.660]   physicists actually realized this pretty quickly.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.340]   I think it was maybe Schrodinger who said
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.340]   that these things are not really weapons,
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.740]   they're political implements, they're not weapons,
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.980]   because the cost is so high.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.300]   And if you take that example and spread it out
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.580]   to the kind of technological development we're seeing now
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.540]   outside of nuclear physics, but I picked the example
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.580]   of biology, I could well imagine that there would be
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.580]   material science sorts of equivalents,
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.540]   that across a broad front of technology,
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.140]   you take that experience from nuclear weapons,
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.100]   and the picture that I see is that it would be so,
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.220]   it would be possible to develop technologies
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.340]   that are so terrible that you couldn't use them,
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.580]   because the costs are too high.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.100]   And that might cure us.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.140]   - And many people have argued that actually it prevented,
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.740]   nuclear weapons have prevented more military conflict than--
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.100]   - It certainly froze the conflict domain.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.060]   It's interesting that nowadays, it was with the removal
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.060]   of the threat of mutually assured destruction
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.220]   that other forces took over in our geopolitics.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:57.220]   Do you have worries of existential threats
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.180]   of nuclear weapons or other technologies
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.660]   like artificial intelligence?
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.020]   Do you think we humans will tend to figure out
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.900]   how to not blow ourselves up?
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.420]   - I don't know, quite frankly.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.820]   This is something I've thought about.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:16.820]   And I'm not, I mean, so I'm a spectator in the sense
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.700]   that as a scientist, I collect and collate data.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.340]   So I've been doing that all my life
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.300]   and looking at my species.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.060]   And it's not clear to me that we are going to avoid
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.620]   a catastrophic self-induced ending.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.660]   - Are you optimistic?
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.020]   Not as a scientist, but as a single--
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.620]   - I would say I wouldn't bet against us.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.140]   - Beautifully put.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.700]   Let's dive into the world of the very small,
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.900]   if we could for a bit.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.380]   What are the basic particles,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.940]   either experimentally observed
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.380]   or hypothesized by physicists?
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.540]   - So as we physicists look at the universe,
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.540]   you can, first of all, there are two big buckets
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.940]   of particles, that is the smallest objects
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.340]   that we are able to currently mathematically conceive
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:15.020]   and then experimentally verify that these ideas
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.780]   have a sense of accuracy to them.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.980]   So one of those buckets we call matter.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.060]   These are things like electrons,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.020]   things that are like quarks,
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.900]   which are particles that exist inside of protons.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.780]   And there's a whole family of these things.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.860]   There are in fact 18 quarks
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.460]   and apparently six electron-like objects
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.460]   that we call leptons.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.100]   So that's one bucket.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.740]   The other bucket that we see both in our mathematics
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.700]   as well as in our experimental equipment
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.820]   are what are a set of particles
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.900]   that you can call force carriers.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.300]   The most familiar force carrier is the photon,
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.220]   the particle of light that allows you to see me.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.700]   In fact, it's the same object
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.340]   that carries electric repulsion between like charges.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.020]   From science fiction, we have the object
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.140]   called the graviton, which is talked about a lot
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.420]   in science fiction and Star Trek.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.580]   But the graviton is also a mathematical object
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:08.980]   that we physicists have known about
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.540]   essentially since Einstein wrote
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.180]   his theory of general relativity.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.700]   There are four forces in nature, the fundamental forces.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.580]   There is the gravitational force,
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.660]   its carrier is the graviton.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.180]   There are three other forces in nature,
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.820]   the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force,
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.020]   and the weak nuclear force.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.220]   And each one of these forces has one or more carriers.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.260]   The photon is the carrier of the electromagnetic force.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.980]   The strong nuclear force actually has eight carriers,
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.260]   they're called gluons.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.620]   And then the weak nuclear force has three carriers,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:44.060]   they're called the W plus, W minus, and Z bosons.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.540]   So those are the things that both in mathematics
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.780]   and in experiments, by the way,
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.060]   the most precise experiments we're ever,
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.140]   as a species, able to conduct,
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.660]   is about measuring the accuracy of these ideas.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.660]   And we know that at least to one part in a billion,
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.620]   these ideas are right.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.540]   - So first of all, you've made it sound
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:08.540]   both elegant and simple, but is it crazy to you
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.300]   that there is force carriers?
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.460]   Like is that supposed to be a trivial idea to think about?
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.300]   If we think about photons, gluons,
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.300]   that there's four fundamental forces of physics,
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.220]   and then those forces are expressed,
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.540]   there's carriers of those forces.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.580]   Like is that a kind of trivial thing?
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.020]   - It's not a trivial thing at all.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.180]   In fact, it was a puzzle for Sir Isaac Newton,
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.180]   because he's the first person to give us basically physics.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.780]   Before Isaac Newton, physics didn't exist.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.740]   What did exist was called natural philosophy.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.860]   So discussions about using the methods
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.380]   of classical philosophy to understand nature,
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.380]   natural philosophy.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.740]   So the Greeks, we call them scientists,
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.860]   but they were natural philosophers.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.620]   Physics doesn't get born until Newton writes the Principia.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.500]   One of the things that puzzled him was how gravity works,
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.860]   because if you read very carefully what he writes,
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.340]   he basically says, and I'm paraphrasing badly,
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.020]   but he basically says that someone who thinks deeply
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.220]   about this subject would find it inconceivable
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:17.020]   that an object in one place or location
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.560]   can magically reach out and affect another object
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.620]   with nothing intervening.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.060]   And so it puzzled him.
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.460]   - Does it puzzle you?
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.700]   - Well, it doesn't-- - Action at a distance.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.980]   I mean, not as a physicist.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.940]   - It would, it would, except that I am a physicist,
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.420]   and we have long ago resolved this issue,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.540]   and the resolution came about
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.860]   through a second great physicist.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.460]   Most people have heard of Newton.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.140]   Most people have heard of Einstein.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.100]   But between the two of them,
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.660]   there was another extraordinarily great physicist,
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.940]   a man named James Clark Maxwell.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.500]   And Maxwell, between these two other giants,
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.940]   taught us about electric and magnetic forces,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.940]   and it's from his equations that one can figure out
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.260]   that there's a carrier called the photon.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.880]   So this was resolved for physicists around 1860 or so.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.780]   - So what are bosons and fermions and hadrons?
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.700]   - Sure. - Elementary and composite.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.660]   - Sure, so earlier I said-- - Two buckets.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.580]   - You've got two buckets
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.820]   if you wanna try to build a universe.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.700]   You gotta start off with things on these two buckets.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.260]   So you gotta have things, that's the matter,
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.780]   and then you have to have other objects that act on them
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:28.420]   to cause those things to cohere to fixed finite patterns,
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.020]   because you need those fixed finite patterns
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.100]   as building blocks.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.980]   So that's the way our universe looks to people like me.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.100]   Now, the building blocks do different things.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.820]   So let's go back to these two buckets again.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.780]   Let me start with a bucket containing the particle of light.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.380]   Let me imagine I'm in a dusty room with two flashlights,
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.780]   and I have one flashlight,
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.300]   which I direct directly in front of me,
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.780]   and then I have you stand over to, say, my left,
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.740]   and then we both take our flashlights and turn them on
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.740]   and make sure the beams go right through each other.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.660]   And the beams do just that, they go right through each other.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.260]   They don't bounce off of each other.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.460]   The reason the room has to be dusty
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.420]   is because we wanna see the light.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.420]   The room dust wasn't there,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.460]   we wouldn't actually see the light
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.980]   until it got to the other wall, right?
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.860]   So you see the beam 'cause it's dust in the air.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.580]   But the two beams actually pass right through each other.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.900]   They literally pass right through.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.860]   They don't affect each other at all.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.860]   One acts like the other, it's not there.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.980]   The particle of light is the simplest example
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.540]   that shows that behavior.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.140]   That's a boson.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.220]   Now let's imagine that I have to,
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.020]   we're in the same dusty room,
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.820]   and this time you have a bucket of balls
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.020]   and I have a bucket of balls.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.140]   And we try to throw them so that we get something
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.280]   like a beam, throwing them fast, right?
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.420]   If they collide, they don't just pass through each other,
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.340]   they bounce off of each other.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.820]   Now, that's mostly because they have electric charge,
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.500]   and electric charges, light charges, repel.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.260]   But mathematically, I know how to turn off
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.460]   the electric charge.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.780]   If you do that, you'll find they still repel.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.100]   And it's because they are these things we call fermions.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.980]   So this is how you distinguish the things
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.140]   that are in the two buckets.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.220]   They are either bosons or fermions.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.980]   - Which of them, and maybe you can mention
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.900]   the most popular of the bosons.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.020]   - The most recently discovered.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.700]   It's like-- - The Higgs boson.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.180]   - Yeah, yeah, it's like when I was in high school
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.260]   and there was a really popular majorette,
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.500]   her name is the Higgs particle these days.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   - Can you describe which of the bosons and the fermions
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.460]   have been discovered, hypothesized,
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.100]   which have been experimentally validated,
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.540]   what's still out there? - Sure, right.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:37.380]   So the two buckets that I've actually described to you
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.140]   have all been first hypothesized
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.060]   and then verified by observation,
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.220]   with the Higgs boson being the most recent
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.180]   one of these things.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.780]   We haven't actually verified the graviton
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:50.660]   interestingly enough.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.060]   We mathematically, we have an expectation
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.340]   that graviton's like this,
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.860]   but we've not performed an experiment
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.900]   to show that this is an accurate idea that nature uses.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.980]   - So something has to be a carrier
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.220]   of force of gravity. - For the force of gravity,
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.460]   exactly.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.460]   Because that's-- - Can it be something
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.940]   way more mysterious than we,
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.460]   so when you say the graviton,
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.140]   would it be like the other particles,
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.700]   force carriers, or can it be something
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.940]   much more mysterious? - In some ways, yes,
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.660]   but in other ways, no.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.820]   It turns out that the graviton is also,
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.100]   if you look at Einstein's theory,
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.500]   he taught us about this thing he calls space-time,
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.260]   which is, if you try to imagine it,
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.380]   you can sort of think of it as kind of a rubber surface.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.860]   That's one popular depiction of space-time.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.180]   It's not an accurate depiction
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.740]   because the only accuracy is actually
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.220]   in the calculus that he uses,
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.100]   but that's close enough.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.740]   So if you have a sheet of rubber, you can wave it.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.020]   You can actually form a wave on it.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.780]   Space-time is enough like that
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.900]   so that when space-time oscillates,
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.980]   you create these waves.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.060]   These waves carry energy.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.020]   We expect them to carry energy in quanta.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.100]   That's what a graviton is.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.780]   It's a wave in space-time.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.700]   And so the fact that we have seen the waves
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.660]   with LIGO over the course of the last three years,
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.140]   and we've recently used gravitational wave observatories
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.700]   to watch colliding black holes and neutron stars
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.420]   and all sorts of really cool stuff out there.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.500]   So we know the waves exist,
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.660]   but in order to know that gravitons exist,
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.700]   you have to prove that these waves carry energy
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.300]   in energy packets,
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   and that's what we don't have the technology to do yet.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:28.260]   - And perhaps briefly jumping to a philosophical question,
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.520]   does it make sense to you that gravity
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.860]   is so much weaker than the other forces?
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.700]   - No.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:40.460]   You see, now you've touched on a very deep mystery
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.620]   about physics.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.220]   There are a lot of such questions of physics
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.140]   about why things are as they are.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.900]   And as someone who believes that there are some things
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.380]   that certainly are coincidences,
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.820]   like you could ask the same question about,
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.100]   well, why are the planets at the orbits
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.900]   that they are around the sun?
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.260]   The answer turns out there is no good reason.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.420]   It's just an accident.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.500]   So there are things in nature that have that character,
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.500]   and perhaps the strength of the various forces is like that.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.900]   On the other hand, we don't know that that's the case,
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.540]   and there may be some deep reasons
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.940]   about why the forces are ordered as they are,
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.640]   where the weakest force is gravity,
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.720]   the next weakest force is the weak interaction,
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.980]   the weak nuclear force,
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.100]   then there's electromagnetism, there's a strong force.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.700]   We don't really have a good understanding
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.040]   of why this is the ordering of the forces.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.900]   - Some of the fascinating work you've done
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.900]   is in the space of supersymmetry, symmetry in general.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.220]   Can you describe, first of all, what is supersymmetry?
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.460]   - Ah, yes.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.420]   So you remember the two buckets I told you about,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.740]   perhaps earlier, I said there are two buckets
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.060]   in our universe.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:51.060]   So now I want you to think about drawing a pie
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.020]   that has four quadrants.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.140]   So I want you to cut the piece of pie in fourths.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.220]   So in one quadrant, I'm gonna put all the buckets
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.340]   that we talked about that are like the electron and quarks.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.340]   In a different quadrant,
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.500]   I am going to put all the force carriers.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.580]   The other two quadrants are empty.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.500]   Now, if you, I showed you a picture of that,
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.060]   you'd see a circle.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.540]   There would be a bunch of stuff in one upper quadrant
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.900]   and stuff in others.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.900]   And then I would ask you a question.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.600]   Does that look symmetrical to you?
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.900]   - No.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.720]   - No.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.100]   And that's exactly right,
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.660]   because we humans actually have a very deeply programmed
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.340]   sense of symmetry.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.780]   It's something that is part of that mystery
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.940]   of the universe.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.420]   So how would you make it symmetrical?
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.980]   One way you could is by saying those two empty quadrants
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.960]   had things in them also.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.520]   And if you do that, that's supersymmetry.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.060]   So that's what I understood when I was a graduate student
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.900]   here at MIT in 1975,
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.240]   when the mathematics of this was first being born.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.060]   Supersymmetry was actually born in the Ukraine
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:55.900]   in the late '60s,
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.620]   but we had this thing called the Iron Curtain,
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.540]   so we Westerners didn't know about it.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.900]   But by the early '70s, independently,
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.300]   there were scientists in the West
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.140]   who had rediscovered supersymmetry.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.440]   Bruno Zemino and Julius Vest were their names.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.180]   So this was around '71 or '72 when this happened.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.240]   I started graduate school in '73,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   so around '74, '75, I was trying to figure out
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.520]   how to write a thesis so that I could become a physicist
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.620]   the rest of my life.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:27.720]   I did a, I had a great advisor, Professor James Young,
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.160]   who had taught me a number of things about electrons
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.000]   and weak forces and those sorts of things.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   But I decided that if I was going to have a really,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.540]   an opportunity to maximize my chances of being successful,
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.940]   I should strike it out in a direction
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.780]   that other people were not studying.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.260]   And so as a consequence, I surveyed ideas
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.380]   that were going, that were being developed,
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.100]   and I came across the idea of supersymmetry.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.740]   And it was so, the mathematics was so remarkable
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.140]   that I just, it bowled me over.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.460]   I actually have two undergraduate degrees.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.540]   My first undergraduate degree is actually mathematics,
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.420]   and my second is physics,
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.040]   even though I always wanted to be a physicist.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:17.500]   Plan A, which involved getting good grades, was mathematics.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.500]   I was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school,
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.820]   but my heart was in physics.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.240]   - If we could take a small digression,
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.080]   what's to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.560]   that you've encountered in this interplay
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.420]   between math and physics?
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.500]   - It's the idea of symmetry.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:40.220]   The fact that our innate sense of symmetry
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:44.540]   winds up aligning with just incredible mathematics,
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.420]   to me, is the most beautiful thing.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.140]   It's very strange, but true,
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.140]   that if symmetries were perfect, we would not exist.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.260]   And so even though we have these very powerful ideas
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.720]   about balance in the universe in some sense,
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.220]   it's only when you break those balances
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.540]   that you get creatures like humans,
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.640]   objects like planets and stars.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.120]   So although they are a scaffold for reality,
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.560]   they cannot be the entirety of reality.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   So I'm kind of naturally attracted to parts of science
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:21.460]   and technology where symmetry plays a dominant role.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.540]   - And not just, I guess, symmetry, as you said,
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.880]   but the magic happens when you break the symmetry.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.620]   - The magic happens when you break the symmetry.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.300]   - Okay, so diving right back in,
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.140]   you mentioned four quadrants.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.100]   - Yes.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.940]   - Two are filled with stuff, two buckets.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.780]   - Yep.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.500]   - And then there's crazy mathematical thing,
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.980]   ideas for filling the other two.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.820]   - The other two.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.380]   - What are those things?
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.260]   - So earlier, the way I described these two buckets
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.960]   is I gave you a story that started out
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.740]   by putting us in a dusty room with two flashlights.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.300]   And I said, "Turn on your flashlight, I'll turn on mine,
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.940]   "the beams will go through each other."
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.020]   And the beams are composed of force carriers called photons.
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.300]   They carry the electromagnetic force.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.420]   And they pass right through each other.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.660]   So imagine looking at the mathematics of such an object,
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.460]   which you don't have to imagine people like me do that.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.860]   So you take that mathematics,
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.260]   and then you ask yourself a question.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.740]   You see, mathematics is a palette.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.740]   It's just like a musical composer
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.500]   is able to construct variations on a theme.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.860]   Well, a piece of mathematics in the hand of a physicist
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.100]   is something that we can construct variations on.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.340]   So even though the mathematics that Maxwell gave us
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:38.220]   about light, we know how to construct variations on that.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.180]   And one of the variations you can construct is to say,
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.740]   suppose you have a force carrier for electromagnetism
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.060]   that behaves like an electron
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.340]   in that it would bounce off of another one.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.260]   That's changing a mathematical term in an equation.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.700]   So if you did that, you would have a force carrier.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.940]   So you would say, first,
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.700]   it belongs in this force-carrying bucket.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.780]   But it's got this property of bouncing off like electrons.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.340]   So you say, "Well, gee, wait, no,
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.580]   "that's not the right bucket."
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:05.740]   So you're forced to actually put it
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.780]   in one of these empty quadrants.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:12.060]   So those sorts of things, basically, we give them a,
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.900]   so the photon mathematically can be accompanied by a photino.
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.180]   It's the thing that carries a force,
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.780]   but has the rule of bouncing off.
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.220]   In a similar manner, you could start with an electron.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.620]   And you say, "Okay, so write down
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.020]   "the mathematics of an electron."
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.220]   I know how to do that.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.180]   A physicist named Dirac first told us how to do that
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.500]   back in the late '20s, early '30s.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.180]   So take that mathematics, and then you say,
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.560]   "Let me look at that mathematics
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.480]   "and find out what in the mathematics
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.140]   "causes two electrons to bounce off of each other,
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:44.500]   "even if I turn off the electrical charge."
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.580]   So I could do that.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.220]   And now let me change that mathematical term.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.700]   So now I have something that carries electrical charge,
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.300]   but if you take two of them,
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.700]   I'm sorry, if you turn their charges off,
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.340]   they'll pass through each other.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.660]   So that puts things in the other quadrant.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.680]   And those things we tend to call,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.540]   we put the S in front of their name.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.820]   So in the lower quadrant here, we have electrons.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.180]   In this now newly filled quadrant, we have selectrons.
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:12.300]   In the quadrant over here, we had quarks.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.740]   Over here, we have squarks.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.580]   So now we've got this balanced pie.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.540]   And that's basically what I understood
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.460]   as a graduate student in 1975
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.400]   about this idea of supersymmetry,
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.340]   that it was going to fill up these two quadrants
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.900]   of the pie in a way that no one
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.740]   had ever thought about before.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.180]   So I was amazed that no one else at MIT
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.340]   found this an interesting idea.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:37.260]   So it led to my becoming the first person in MIT
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.500]   to really study supersymmetry.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.620]   This is 1975, '76, '77.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.860]   And in '77, I wrote the first PhD thesis
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.100]   in the physics department on this idea
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.620]   because I was drawn to the balance.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.580]   - Drawn to the symmetry.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:56.580]   So what does that, first of all,
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:01.260]   is this fundamentally a mathematical idea?
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.420]   So how much experimental, and we'll have this theme,
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.620]   it's a really interesting one.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.220]   When you explore the world of the small
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.300]   and in your new book talking about
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.140]   approving Einstein, right, that we'll also talk about,
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.700]   there's this theme of kind of starting at,
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.660]   exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.980]   and then seeking for ways to experimentally validate them.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.660]   Where do you put supersymmetry in that?
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.340]   - It's closer than string theory.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.820]   It has not yet been validated.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.280]   In some sense, you mentioned Einstein,
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.500]   so let's go there for a moment.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.140]   In our book, Proving Einstein Right,
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.940]   we actually do talk about the fact
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:43.060]   that Albert Einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.260]   which were very different from Newton's equations
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.940]   in describing gravity.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.060]   These equations made some predictions
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.380]   that were different from Newton's predictions.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.220]   It actually made three different predictions.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.180]   One of them was not actually a prediction
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.140]   but a postdiction because it was known
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.620]   that Mercury was not orbiting the sun
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.740]   in the way that Newton would have told you.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:05.500]   And so Einstein's theory actually describes Mercury
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.340]   orbiting in a way that it was observed
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.940]   as opposed to what Newton would have told you.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.740]   So that was one prediction.
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.380]   The second prediction that came out
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.780]   of the theory of general relativity,
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.500]   which Einstein wrote in 1915,
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.460]   was that if you,
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:24.660]   so let me describe an experiment and come back to it.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.740]   Suppose I had a glass of water
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.180]   and I filled the glass up
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.300]   and then I moved the glass slowly back and forth
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.060]   between our two faces.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:37.820]   It would appear to me like your face was moving,
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.060]   even though you weren't moving.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.260]   I mean, it's actually, and what's causing it
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.620]   is because the light gets bent through the glass
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.380]   as it passes from your face to my eye.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:51.380]   So Einstein, in his 1915 theory of general relativity,
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.460]   found out that gravity has the same effect on light
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.500]   as that glass of water.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.260]   It would cause beams of light to bend.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.020]   Now, Newton also knew this,
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.380]   but Einstein's prediction was
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.780]   that light would bend twice as much.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.300]   And so here's a mathematical idea.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.980]   Now, how do you actually prove it?
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.740]   - Well, you've got to watch, yeah.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.180]   - Just a quick pause on that,
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.740]   just the language you're using.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.860]   He found out--
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.620]   - I can say he did a calculation.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.220]   - It's a really interesting notion
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.180]   that one of the beautiful things about this universe
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.980]   is you can do a calculation
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.940]   and combine with some of that magical intuition
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.340]   that physicists have,
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.260]   actually predict what would be,
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.620]   what's possible to experiment to validate.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.460]   - That's correct.
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.500]   - And he found out in the sense that
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.300]   there seems to be something here
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.020]   and mathematically it should bend,
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.540]   gravity should bend light this amount.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.380]   And so therefore that's something that could be potentially,
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.340]   and then come up with an experiment that could be validated.
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.420]   - Right.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.340]   And that's the way that actually modern physics,
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.900]   deeply fundamental modern physics,
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.980]   this is how it works.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.460]   Earlier we spoke about the Higgs boson.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.060]   So why did we go looking for it?
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:11.980]   The answer is that back in the late '60s, early '70s,
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.860]   some people wrote some equations
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.620]   and the equations predicted this.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.180]   So then we went looking for it.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:22.320]   - So on supersymmetry for a second,
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.340]   there's these things called Dinkers symbols,
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.620]   these strange little graphs.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.460]   - Yes.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.700]   - You refer to them as revealing something like binary code.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:32.540]   - Yes.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.740]   - Underlying reality.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.580]   - Yes.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.940]   - First of all, can you describe these graphs?
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.780]   What are they?
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.740]   What are these beautiful little strange graphs?
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.860]   - Well, first of all, the Dinkers are an invention of mine,
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.940]   together with a colleague named Michael Fox.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.060]   In 2005, we were looking at equations.
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.820]   Well, the story's a little bit more complicated
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.080]   and it'll take too long to explain all the details,
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.380]   but the Reader's Digest version is that we were looking
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:01.180]   at these equations and we figured out that all the data
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.660]   in a certain class of equations could be put in pictures.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.460]   And the pictures, what do they look like?
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.380]   Well, they're just little balls.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.100]   You have black balls and white balls.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.140]   Those stand for those two buckets, by the way,
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.740]   that we talked about in reality.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.600]   The white balls are things that are like particles of light.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.800]   The black balls are like electrons.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.460]   And then you can draw lines connecting these balls.
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.460]   And these lines are deeply mathematical objects
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.100]   and there's no way for me to,
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:33.900]   I have no physical model for telling you what the lines are.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.260]   But if you were a mathematician,
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.980]   I would do a technical phrase saying,
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.620]   this is the orbit of the representation
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.900]   and the action of the symmetry generators.
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.660]   Mathematicians wouldn't understand that.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:45.140]   Nobody else in their right mind would,
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.240]   so let's not go there.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.980]   But we figured out that the data that was in the equations
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.820]   was in these funny pictures that we could draw.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.480]   And so that was stunning,
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:59.720]   but it also was encouraging
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.480]   because there are problems with the equations,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.800]   which I had first learned about in 1979
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.000]   when I was down at Harvard.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.940]   I went out to Caltech for the first time
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.760]   and working with a great scientist
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.780]   by the name of John Schwarz.
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.080]   There are problems in the equations we don't know how to solve.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.380]   And so one of the things about solving problems
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.200]   that you don't know how to solve
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.880]   is that beating your head against a brick wall
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.940]   is probably not a good philosophy about how to solve it.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:26.840]   So what do you need to do?
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.320]   You need to change your sense of reference,
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.400]   your frame of reference, your perspective.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.160]   So when I saw these funny pictures,
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.520]   I thought, "Gee, that might be a way
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.100]   to solve these problems with equations
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.880]   that we don't know how to do."
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.440]   So that was for me one of the first attractions
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.000]   is that I now had an alternative language
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.860]   to try to attack a set of mathematical problems.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:54.640]   But I quickly realized that A,
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.140]   this mathematical language was not known by mathematicians,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.920]   which makes it pretty interesting
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.760]   because now you have to actually teach mathematicians
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.120]   about a piece of mathematics
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.000]   because that's how they make their living.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.040]   And the great thing about working with mathematicians,
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.080]   of course, is the rigor with which they examine ideas.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:14.480]   So they make your ideas better than they start out.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.680]   So I started working with a group of mathematicians
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.540]   and it was in that collaboration that we figured out
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.380]   that these funny pictures
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.480]   had error correcting codes buried in them.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.720]   So--
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.880]   - Can you talk about what are error correcting codes?
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.720]   - Sure.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.880]   So the simplest way to talk about error correcting codes
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.840]   is first of all, to talk about digital information.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.640]   Digital information is basically strings of ones and zeros.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.120]   They're called bits.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:45.760]   So now let's imagine that I want to send you some bits.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.360]   Well, maybe I could show you pictures,
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.200]   but maybe it's a rainy day
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:56.360]   or maybe the windows in your house are foggy.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.320]   So sometimes when I show you a zero,
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.680]   you might interpret it as a one.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.360]   Or other times when I show you a one,
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.800]   you might interpret it as a zero.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.680]   So if that's the case,
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.880]   that means when I try to send you this data,
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.080]   it comes to you in corrupted form.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.340]   And so the challenge is how do you get it to be uncorrupted?
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:20.600]   In the 1940s, a computer scientist named Hamming
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:24.760]   addressed the problem of how do you reliably transmit
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.240]   digital information?
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.600]   And what he came up with was a brilliant idea.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.160]   The way to solve it is that you take the data
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.200]   that you want to send,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.920]   the ones in your strings of ones and zeros,
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.160]   your favorite string,
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.040]   and then you dump more ones and zeros in,
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.240]   but you dump them in in a particular pattern.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.920]   And this particular pattern
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.320]   is what a Hamming code is all about.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.600]   So it's an error correcting code,
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.360]   because if the person at the other end
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.800]   knows what the pattern's supposed to be,
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.200]   they can figure out when ones got changed to zeros,
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.720]   zeros got changed to one.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:57.520]   So it turned out that our strange little objects
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.320]   that came from looking at the equations
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.800]   that we couldn't solve,
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.720]   it turns out that when you look at them deeply enough,
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.500]   you find out that they have ones and zeros buried in them,
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.840]   but even more astoundingly,
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.840]   the ones and zeros are not there randomly.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.180]   They are in the pattern of error correcting codes.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.000]   So this was an astounding thing
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   that when we first got this result
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   and tried to publish it,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.960]   it took us three years to convince other physicists
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.080]   that we weren't crazy.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.200]   Eventually we were able to publish it,
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.400]   I and this collaboration of mathematicians
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.360]   and other physicists.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.460]   And so ever since then,
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.400]   I have actually been looking at the mathematics
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.960]   of these objects,
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.220]   trying to still understand properties of the equations.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.880]   And I want to understand the properties of the equations
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.320]   'cause I want to be able to try things like electrons.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.320]   So as you can see,
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.280]   it's just like a two step remove process
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.440]   of trying to get back to reality.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.960]   - So what would you say is the most beautiful property
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   of these Dinkera graphs, objects?
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.120]   What do you think, by the way, the word symbols,
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.680]   what do you think of them, these simple graphs?
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.240]   Are they objects or are they--
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.320]   - They're, for people who work with mathematics like me,
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.560]   our mathematical concepts are,
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.040]   we often refer to them as objects
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.220]   because they feel like real things.
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.880]   Even though you can't see them or touch them,
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.120]   they're so much part of your interior life
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.800]   that it is as if you could.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.080]   So we often refer to these things as objects,
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.520]   even though there's nothing objective about them.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.720]   - And what does a single graph represent in space?
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.120]   - Okay, so the simplest of these graphs
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.700]   has to have one white ball and one black ball.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.480]   That's that balance that we talked about earlier.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.240]   Remember, we want to balance out the quadrants?
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.280]   Well, you can't do it unless you have
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.840]   a black ball and white ball.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.200]   So the simplest of these objects
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.840]   looks like two little balls,
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.440]   one black, one white, connected by a single line.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.760]   And what it's talking about is, as I said,
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.680]   a deep mathematical property related to symmetry.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.280]   - You've mentioned the error-correcting codes,
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.480]   but is there a particular beautiful property
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.440]   that stands out to you about these objects
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.480]   that you just find?
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   - Yes. - I mean, they're very--
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.620]   - Yes, there is. - Early on
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.880]   in the development. - Yes, there is.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.800]   The craziest thing about these to me
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:14.200]   is that when you look at physics
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.040]   and try to write equations where information
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.600]   gets transmitted reliably,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:22.240]   if you're in one of these supersymmetrical systems
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.560]   with this extra symmetry, that doesn't happen
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.800]   unless there's an error-correcting code present.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.120]   So it's as if the universe says,
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.960]   you don't retransmit information
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.240]   unless there's something about an error-correcting code.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.160]   This to me is the craziest thing
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.320]   that I've ever personally encountered in my research.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.040]   And it's actually got me to wondering
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.480]   how this could come about,
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.600]   because the only place in nature
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.560]   that we know about error-correcting codes is genetics.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.200]   And in genetics, we think it was evolution
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:53.160]   that causes error-correcting codes to be in genomes.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.000]   And so does that mean that there was some kind of form
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.120]   of evolution acting on the mathematical laws
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.440]   of the physics of our universe?
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.560]   This is a very bizarre and strange idea,
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.420]   and something I've wondered about from time to time
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.400]   since making these discoveries.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.200]   - Do you think such an idea could be fundamental,
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.800]   or is it emergent throughout
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.280]   all the different kinds of systems?
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.960]   - I don't know whether it's fundamental.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.240]   I probably will not live to find out.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.760]   This is gonna be the work of probably some future
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.160]   either mathematician or physicist
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.800]   to figure out what these things actually mean.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.020]   - We have to talk a bit about the magical,
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.400]   the mysterious string theory, super string theory.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.240]   - Sure.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.440]   - There's still maybe this aspect of it,
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.000]   which is there's still, for me,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.560]   from an outsider's perspective,
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.600]   this fascinating heated debate.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.760]   On the status of string theory.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.760]   Can you clarify this debate,
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.800]   perhaps articulating the various views,
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.880]   and say where you land on it?
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.320]   - So first of all, I doubt that I will be able
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.840]   to say anything to clarify the debate
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   around string theory for a general audience.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.880]   Part of the reason is because string theory
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.760]   has done something I've never seen theoretical physics do.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.000]   It has broken out into consciousness
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.560]   of the general public before we're finished.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.960]   You see, string theory doesn't actually exist.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.320]   Because when we use the word theory,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.240]   we mean a particular set of attributes.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.320]   In particular, it means that you have an overarching paradigm
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.080]   that explains what it is that you're doing.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.080]   No such overarching paradigm exists for string theory.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.960]   What string theory is currently
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   is an enormously large, mutually reinforcing
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.560]   collection of mathematical facts,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.640]   in which we can find no contradictions.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.800]   We don't know why it's there,
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.920]   but we can certainly say that without challenge.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.680]   Now, just because you find a piece of mathematics
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.360]   doesn't mean that it applies to nature.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.320]   And in fact, there has been a very heated debate
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.400]   about whether string theory is some sort of hysteria
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.120]   among the community of theoretical physicists,
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.600]   or whether it has something fundamental
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.560]   to say about our universe.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.440]   We don't yet know the answer to that question.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.680]   Those of us who study string theory will tell you
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.400]   are things like, string theory has been
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.360]   extraordinarily productive in getting us
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.320]   to think more deeply, even about mathematics
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.040]   that's not string theory, but the kind of mathematics
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.880]   that we've used to describe elementary particles.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.680]   There have been spinoffs from string theory,
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.640]   and this has been going on now for two decades almost,
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.080]   that have allowed us, for example,
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.400]   to more accurately calculate the force between electrons
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.720]   with the presence of quantum mechanics.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.240]   This is not something you hear about in the public.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.960]   There are other similar things,
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.800]   that kind of property I just told you about
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   is what's called weak-strong duality,
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.000]   and it comes directly from string theory.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.920]   There are other things such as
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.560]   a property called holography,
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.680]   which allows one to take equations
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.880]   and look at them on the boundary of a space,
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.120]   and then to know information about inside the space
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.520]   without actually doing calculations there.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.160]   This has come directly from string theory.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.600]   So there are a number of direct mathematical effects
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.240]   that we learned in string theory,
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.680]   but we take these ideas and look at math
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.280]   that we already know, and we find suddenly
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.520]   we're more powerful.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.760]   This is a pretty good indication
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.240]   there's something interesting going on
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.240]   with string theory itself.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.040]   - So it's the early days of a powerful
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.080]   mathematical framework.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.320]   - That's what we have right now.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.800]   - What are the big, first of all,
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.560]   for most people, probably, which as you said,
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.440]   most general public would know actually
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.000]   what string theory is, which is at the highest level,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.560]   which is a fascinating fact.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.160]   - Well, string theory is what they do
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.720]   on the Big Bang Theory, right?
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.420]   (Lex laughing)
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:51.280]   - One, can you maybe describe what is string theory,
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.200]   and two, what are the open challenges?
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.480]   - So what is string theory?
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:02.000]   Well, the simplest explanation I can provide
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.080]   is to go back and ask what are particles,
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.580]   which is the question you first asked me.
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.720]   - What's the smallest thing?
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.000]   - Yeah, what's the smallest thing?
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   So particles, one way I try to describe particles
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.840]   for people to start, I want you to imagine a little ball,
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.600]   and I want you to let the size of that ball
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.000]   shrink until it has no extent whatsoever,
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.840]   but it still has the mass of the ball.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.800]   That's actually what Newton was working with
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.280]   when he first invented physics.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.160]   He's the real inventor of the massive particle,
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.520]   which is this idea that underlies all of physics.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.480]   So that's where we start.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.100]   It's a mathematical construct that you get
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.300]   by taking a limit of things that you know.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.880]   So what's a string?
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.320]   Well, in the same analogy, I would say,
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.280]   now I want you to start with a piece of spaghetti,
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.200]   so we all know what that looks like,
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.800]   and now I want you to let the thickness of the spaghetti
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.560]   shrink until it has no thickness.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.160]   Mathematically, I mean, in words this makes no sense,
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.080]   but mathematically this actually works,
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.500]   and you get this mathematical object out.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.440]   It has properties that are like spaghetti.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.000]   It can wiggle and jiggle, but it can also move
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.520]   collectively like a piece of spaghetti.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.120]   It's the mathematics of those sorts of objects
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.680]   that constitute string theory.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:33.000]   - And does the multidimensional, 11-dimensional,
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   however many dimensional, more than four dimension,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.920]   is that a crazy idea to you?
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.120]   Is that the stranger aspect of string theory to you?
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.120]   - Not really, and also partly because of my own research.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.640]   So earlier we talked about these strange symbols
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.160]   that we've discovered inside the equations.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.120]   It turns out that to a very large extent,
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.480]   a dinkers don't really care about the number of dimensions.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.400]   They kind of have an internal mathematical consistency
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.040]   that allows them to be manifest
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.920]   in many different dimensions.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.380]   Since supersymmetry is a part of string theory,
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.280]   then this same property you would expect
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.440]   to be inherited by string theory.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.480]   However, another little known fact,
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.280]   which is not in the public debate,
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.840]   is that there are actually strings
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.820]   that are only four dimensional.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.520]   This is something that was discovered
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.160]   at the end of the '80s by three different groups
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.920]   of physicists working independently.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.480]   I and my friend Warren Siegel,
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.600]   who were at the University of Maryland at the time,
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.720]   were able to prove that there's mathematics
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.640]   that looks totally four dimensional, and yet it's a string.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.240]   There was a group in Germany
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.840]   that used slightly different mathematics,
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.640]   but they found the same result.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.400]   And then there was a group at Cornell
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.640]   who using yet a third piece of mathematics
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.480]   found the same result.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.520]   So the fact that extra dimensions
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.800]   is so widely talked about in the public
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.760]   is partly a function of how the public
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.360]   has come to understand string theory
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.640]   and how the story has been told to them.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.600]   But there are alternatives you don't know about.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.480]   - If we could talk about maybe experimental validation.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.480]   And you're the co-author of a recently published book,
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.020]   Proving Einstein Right.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.480]   The human story of it, too.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.200]   The daring expeditions that change
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.960]   how we look at the universe.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.160]   Do you see echoes of the early days
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.840]   of general relativity in the 1910s
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.840]   to the more stretched out to string theory?
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.160]   - I do, I do.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.560]   And that's one reason why I was happy to focus
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:38.560]   on the story of how Einstein became a global superstar.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:45.500]   Earlier in our discussion,
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:51.080]   we went over his history where in 1915
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.920]   he came up with this piece of mathematics,
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.680]   used it to do some calculations,
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.040]   and then made a prediction.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.160]   But making a prediction is not enough.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.040]   Someone's got to go out and measure.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.000]   And so string theory is in that in-between zone.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.920]   Now for Einstein, it was from 1915 to 1919.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.360]   In 1915 he makes the correct prediction.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.400]   By the way, he made an incorrect prediction
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.760]   about the same thing in 1911,
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.200]   but he corrected himself in 1915.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.760]   And by 1919, the first pieces of experimental
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:28.040]   observational data became available to say,
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.160]   yes, he's not wrong.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.920]   And by 1922, the argument based on observation
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.520]   was overwhelming that he was not wrong.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.800]   - Can you describe what special
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.680]   and general relativity are just briefly?
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.520]   - Sure.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.720]   - In the sense in what prediction Einstein made
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.720]   and maybe some or memorable moment
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.960]   from the human journey of trying to prove this thing right,
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.040]   which is incredible.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.560]   - Right, so I'm very fortunate to have worked
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.560]   with a talented novelist who wanted to write a book
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.760]   that coincided with a book I wanted to write
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.760]   about how science kind of feels if you're a person.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.160]   'Cause it's actually people who do science,
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.740]   even though that may not be obvious to everyone.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.680]   So for me, I wanted to write this book
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.640]   for a couple of reasons.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.480]   I wanted young people to understand
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.480]   that these seeming alien giants that live before them
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.080]   were just as human as they are.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.800]   - They get married, they get divorced.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.120]   - They get married, they get divorced.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.600]   They do terrible things, they do great things.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.200]   They're people, they're just people like you.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.920]   And so that part of telling the story
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.240]   allowed me to get that out there
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.560]   for both young people interested in the sciences
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.640]   as well as the public.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:52.440]   But the other part of the story
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   is I wanted to open up sort of what it was like.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.440]   Now, I'm a scientist,
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.680]   and so I will not pretend to be a great writer.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.700]   I understand a lot about mathematics,
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.120]   and I've even created my own mathematics
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.120]   that it's kind of a weird thing to be able to do.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.960]   But in order to tell the story,
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.360]   you really have to have an incredible
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.880]   master of the narrative.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.520]   And that was my co-author, Cathy Pelletier,
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.080]   who is a novelist.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.620]   So we formed this conjoined brain, I used to call us.
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:30.120]   She used to call us Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.200]   My expression for us is that we were a conjoined brain
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.000]   to tell this story.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.760]   And it allowed, so what are some magical moments?
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.880]   To me, the first magical moment in telling the story
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.460]   was looking at Albert Einstein and his struggle.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.700]   Because although we regard him as a genius,
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.480]   as I said, in 1911, he actually made an incorrect prediction
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.640]   about bending starlight.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.040]   And that's actually what set the astronomers off.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.200]   In 1914, there was an eclipse.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:07.680]   And by various accidents of war and weather
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.400]   and all sorts of things that we talk about in the book,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.080]   no one was able to make the measurement.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.080]   If they had made the measurement,
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.140]   it would have disagreed with his 1911 prediction.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:23.600]   Because nature only has one answer.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.760]   And so then you see how fortunate he was
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:32.160]   that wars and bad weather and accidents
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.800]   and transporting equipment stopped any measurements
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.020]   from being made.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.080]   So he corrects himself in 1915,
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.340]   but the astronomers are already out there
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.840]   trying to make the measurement.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.640]   So now he gives them a different number.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.800]   And it turns out that's the number that nature agrees with.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.160]   So it gives you a sense of this is a person
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.340]   struggling with something deeply.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:57.040]   And although his deep insight led him to this,
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.760]   it is the circumstance of time, place and accident
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.920]   through which we view him.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.160]   And the story could have turned out very differently
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.800]   where first he makes a prediction,
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.080]   the measurements are made in 1914,
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.760]   they disagree with his prediction.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.800]   And so what would the world view him as?
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.720]   Well, he's this professor who made this prediction
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:19.520]   that didn't get it right.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.680]   Yes?
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:25.680]   So the fragility of human history
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.780]   is illustrated by that story.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.720]   And it's one of my favorite things.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.640]   You also learn things like in our book,
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.080]   how eclipses and watching eclipses
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   was a driver of the development of science in our nation
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:38.920]   when it was very young.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.760]   In fact, even before we were a nation,
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.760]   it turns out there were citizens of this would-be country
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.680]   that were going out trying to measure eclipses.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.120]   - So some fortune, some misfortune
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.920]   affects the progress of science.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.800]   - Absolutely.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.920]   - Especially with ideas as, to me at least,
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.760]   if I put myself back in those days,
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.560]   as radical as general relativity is.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.760]   First, can you describe, if it's okay,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.360]   briefly what general relativity is?
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.300]   And yeah, could you just take a moment of,
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.360]   yeah, put yourself in those shoes,
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.720]   in academic researchers, scientists of that time,
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.200]   and what is this theory?
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.500]   What is it trying to describe about our world?
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.640]   - It's trying to answer the thing
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.200]   that left Isaac Newton puzzled.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.000]   Isaac Newton says, "Gravity magically goes
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.800]   "from one place to another."
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.320]   He doesn't believe it, by the way.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.360]   He knows that's not right.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.120]   But the mathematics is so good that you have to say,
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.020]   well, I'll throw my qualms away because I'll use it.
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.260]   That's all we used to get a man
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.180]   from the Earth to the Moon was that mathematics.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:03.440]   So I'm one of those scientists, and I've seen this.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.900]   And if I thought deeply about it,
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.600]   maybe I know that Newton himself wasn't comfortable.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.500]   And so the first thing I would hope that I would feel is,
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.120]   gee, there's this young kid out there
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.060]   who has an idea to fill in this hole
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.680]   that was left with us by Sir Isaac Newton.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.060]   That would, I hope, would be my reaction.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.800]   I have a suspicion.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.120]   I'm kind of a mathematical creature.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.800]   I was four years old when I first decided
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.560]   that science was what I wanted to do with my life.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:38.560]   And so if my personality back then was like it is now,
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.480]   I think it's probably likely I would have wanted
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.600]   to have studied his mathematics.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.200]   What was a piece of mathematics that he was using
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.660]   to make this prediction?
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:50.040]   Because he didn't actually create that mathematics.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.200]   That mathematics was created roughly 50 years
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.280]   before he lived.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.400]   He's the person who harnessed it
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.240]   in order to make a prediction.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.800]   In fact, he had to be taught this mathematics by a friend.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.960]   So this is in our book.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:07.780]   So putting myself in that time, I would want to,
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.320]   like I said, I think I would feel excitement.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.920]   I would want to know what the mathematics is,
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.600]   and then I would want to do the calculations myself.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.660]   Because one thing that physics is all about
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.440]   is that you don't have to take anybody's word for anything.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.980]   You can do it yourself.
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:22.240]   - It does seem that mathematics
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.640]   is a little bit more tolerant of radical ideas,
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.820]   or mathematicians, or people who find beauty in mathematics.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:33.480]   All the white questions have no good answer,
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.640]   but let me ask, why do you think Einstein
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.520]   never got the Nobel Prize for general relativity?
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.320]   He got it for the photoelectric effect.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.140]   - That is correct.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.920]   Well, first of all, that's something that is misunderstood
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.080]   about the Nobel Prize in physics.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.160]   The Nobel Prize in physics is never given
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.180]   for purely proposing an idea.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:57.240]   It is always given for proposing an idea
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.720]   that has observational support.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.360]   So he could not get the Nobel Prize
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.320]   for either special relativity nor general relativity
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.720]   because the provisions that Alfred Nobel left
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.600]   for the award prevent that.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.600]   - But after it's been validated,
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.080]   can he not get it then, or no?
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.920]   - Yes, but remember the validation
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.680]   doesn't really come until the 1920s.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.740]   - Yeah, but that's why they invented
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.480]   the second Nobel Prize.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.120]   I mean, Marie Curie, you can get a second Nobel Prize
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.520]   for one of the greatest theories in physics.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.720]   - So let's be clear on this.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.440]   The theory of general relativity
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.560]   had its critics even up until the '50s.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:48.020]   So if the committee had wanted to give the prize
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.440]   for general relativity,
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.180]   there were vociferous critics of general relativity
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.740]   up until the '50s.
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.740]   Einstein died in 1955.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.740]   - What lessons do you draw from the story you tell
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.660]   in the book, from general relativity,
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.060]   from the radical nature of the theory,
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.860]   to looking at the future of string theory?
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.580]   - Well, I think that the string theorists
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:17.920]   are probably going to retrace this path,
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.020]   but it's gonna be far longer and more torturous,
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:20.980]   in my opinion.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:27.180]   String theory is such a broad and deep development
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:34.140]   that, in my opinion, when it becomes acceptable,
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:38.060]   it's gonna be because of a confluence of observation.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.580]   It's not gonna be a single observation.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.040]   And I have to tell you that,
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.480]   so I gave a seminar here yesterday at MIT,
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.700]   and it's on an idea I have
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.380]   about how string theory can leave signatures
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.820]   in the cosmic microwave background,
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:56.740]   which is an astrophysical structure.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:00.440]   And so if those kinds of observations are borne out,
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.980]   if perhaps other things related to the idea
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.240]   of supersymmetry are borne out,
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.540]   those are gonna be the first powerful observationally-based
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:15.380]   pieces of evidence that will begin to do
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:19.600]   what the Eddington expedition did in 1919.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.880]   But that may take several decades.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.740]   - Do you think there will be Nobel Prizes
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.180]   given for string theory?
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.300]   - No.
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.360]   - Because decades.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.420]   - Because I think the original,
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:31.180]   because I, it'll be,
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:34.980]   I think it will exceed normal human lifetimes.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.120]   But there are other prizes that are given.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.200]   I mean, there is something called the Breakthrough Prize.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.960]   There's a Russian immigrant,
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.200]   a Russian-American immigrant named Yuri Milner,
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.380]   I believe his name,
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.020]   started this wonderful prize called the Breakthrough Prize.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.040]   It's three times as much money as the Nobel Prize,
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.960]   and it gets awarded every year.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.280]   And so something like one of those prizes
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.600]   is likely to be garnered at some point
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.440]   far earlier than a Nobel Award.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.720]   - Jumping around a few topics,
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.600]   while you were at Caltech,
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.600]   you've gotten to interact,
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.280]   I believe, with Richard Feynman, I have to ask.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.080]   - Yes, Richard Feynman, indeed.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.560]   - Do you have any stories that stand out
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.400]   in your memory of that time?
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.200]   - Well, I have a fair number of stories,
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.960]   but I'm not prepared to tell them.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.840]   They're not all politically correct,
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.440]   shall we say.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.080]   Let me just say, I'll say the following.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.000]   Richard Feynman, if you've ever read
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.920]   some of the books about him,
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.080]   in particular there's a book called
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.000]   "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman."
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.520]   There's a series of books that starts
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.680]   with "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman."
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.960]   And I think the second one may be something like
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.080]   "What Do You Care What They Say?"
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.120]   or something, I mean, the titles are all,
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.600]   there are three of them.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.680]   When I read those books,
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.840]   I was amazed at how accurately
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.160]   those books portrayed the man that I interacted with.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.920]   He was irreverent, he was fun,
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.600]   he was deeply intelligent,
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.600]   he was deeply human.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.320]   And those books tell that story very effectively.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.800]   - Even just those moments,
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.120]   how did they affect you as a physicist?
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.920]   - Well, it's funny because one of the things
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.480]   that, I didn't hear Feynman say this,
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.520]   but one of the things that is reported that he said
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:29.720]   is if you're in a bar stool as a physicist,
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.760]   and you can't explain to the guy on the bar stool
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.880]   next to you what you're doing,
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.840]   you don't understand what you're doing.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:40.760]   And there's a lot of that that I think is correct,
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.720]   that when you truly understand something
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.680]   as complicated as string theory,
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:54.600]   when it's in its fully formed final development,
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.200]   it should be something you could tell
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.960]   to the person on the bar stool next to you.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.960]   And that's something that affects
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.880]   the way I do science, quite frankly.
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.160]   It also affects the way I talk to the public about science.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.520]   It's one of my mantras that I keep deeply,
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.720]   and try to keep deeply before me
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.000]   when I appear in public fora,
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.520]   speaking about physics in particular,
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.160]   and science in general.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:24.240]   It's also something that Einstein said in a different way.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.200]   He said, he had these two different formulations.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.600]   One of them is, when the answer's simple, it's God speaking.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.400]   And the other thing that he said was that
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.560]   what he did in his work was simply
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.680]   the distillation of common sense,
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.680]   that you distill down to something.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.840]   And he also said, you make things
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.760]   as simple as possible, but no simpler.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.760]   So all of those things, and certainly this attitude for me,
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.360]   first sort of seeing this was exemplified
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.240]   by being around Richard Feynman.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.400]   - So in all your work, you're always kind of searching
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.600]   for the simplicity, for the simple, clear--
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.200]   - I am, ultimately.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.960]   Ultimately, I am.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.440]   - You served on President Barack Obama's
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.640]   Council of Advisors in Science and Technology.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.720]   - For seven years, yes.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.240]   - For seven years with Eric Schmidt
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.360]   and several other brilliant people.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.560]   - Met Eric for the first time in 2009,
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.840]   when the council was called together.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.440]   - Yeah, I've seen pictures of you in that room.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.040]   I mean, there's a bunch of brilliant people.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.440]   It kind of looks amazing.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.640]   What was that experience like,
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.280]   being called upon that kind of service?
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.600]   - So let me go back to my father, first of all.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.360]   I earlier mentioned that my father served
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.000]   27 years in the US Army, starting in World War II.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   He went off in 1942, '43 to fight against the fascists.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.880]   He was part of the supply corps that supplied
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.560]   General Patton as the tanks rolled across Western Europe,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.600]   pushing back the forces of Nazism.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.920]   To meet up with our Russian comrades
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:59.680]   who were pushing the Nazis, starting in Stalingrad.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.960]   The Second World War is actually a very interesting
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:08.400]   piece of history to know from both sides.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.960]   Here in America, we typically don't,
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.480]   but I've actually studied history as an adult,
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.440]   so I actually know sort of the whole story.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.840]   - And on the Russian side, we don't know the Americans.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.200]   We weren't taught the American side of the story.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.400]   - I know, I have many Russian friends,
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400]   and we've had this conversation on many occasions.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.240]   - It's fascinating.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.280]   - But you know, like General Zhukov, for example,
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.640]   is something that you would know about,
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.840]   but you might not know about a Patton, but you're right.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:34.760]   So, Georgy Zhukov, or Rokossovsky,
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.960]   I mean, there's a whole list of names
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.920]   that I've learned in the last 15 or 20 years
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.000]   looking at the Second World War.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:41.880]   So--
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.360]   - Your father was in the midst of that,
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.560]   probably one of the greatest wars in history.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.600]   - In the history of our species.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.120]   And so, the idea of service comes to me,
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.720]   essentially, from that example.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:02.640]   So, in 2009, when I first got a call
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:08.040]   from a Nobel Laureate, actually, in biology,
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:12.400]   Harold Farmis, was on my way to India,
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.640]   and I got this email message,
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.560]   and he said he needed to talk to me,
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.120]   and I said, "Okay, fine, we can talk."
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   I got back and states I didn't hear from him.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.600]   We went through several cycles of this,
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.320]   sending me messages, "I wanna talk to you,"
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.800]   and then never contacted him.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.440]   Finally, I was on my way to give a physics presentation
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.800]   at the University of Florida in Gainesville,
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.600]   and just had stepped off a plane,
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.120]   and my mobile phone went off, and it was Harold.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.360]   And so, I said, "Harold, why do you keep sending me messages
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.120]   "that you wanna talk, but you never call?"
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.320]   And he said, "Well, I'm sorry,
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.280]   "things have been hectic, and da-da-da-da-da."
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.920]   And then he said, "If you were offered the opportunity
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:55.060]   "to serve on the US President's Council of Advisors
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:58.400]   "on Science and Technology, what would be your answer?"
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.440]   Now, I was amused at the formulation of the question,
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.040]   because it's clear that there's a purpose
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.520]   of why the question is asked that way.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.480]   But then, he made it clear to me he wasn't joking,
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.200]   and literally, one of the few times in my life,
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:19.040]   my knees went weak, and I had to hold myself up
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.320]   against a wall so that I didn't fall over.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:28.080]   I doubt if most of us who have been the beneficiaries
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.920]   of the benefits of this country,
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.880]   when given that kind of opportunity, could say no.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.800]   And I know I certainly couldn't say no.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.600]   I was frightened out of my wits,
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.640]   because I had never,
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:48.400]   although I have, my career in terms of
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.680]   policy recommendations is actually quite long,
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.480]   it goes back to the '80s, but I had never been called upon
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:01.880]   to serve as an advisor to a President of the United States.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:09.440]   And it was very scary, but I did not feel
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:12.000]   that I could say no, 'cause I wouldn't be able
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.840]   to sleep with myself at night,
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.960]   saying that I chickened out or whatever.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.520]   And so I took the plunge, and we had a pretty good run.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.160]   There are things that I did in those seven years
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.320]   of which I'm extraordinarily proud.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.960]   One of the ways I tell people is,
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.240]   if you've ever seen that television cartoon
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.960]   called Schoolhouse Rock, there's this one story
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.480]   about how a bill becomes a law, and I've kind of lived that.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.960]   There are things that I did
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.580]   that have now been codified in US law.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.800]   Not everybody gets a chance to do things like that in life.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.640]   - What do you think is the, science and technology,
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.780]   especially in American politics,
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:27:00.240]   we haven't had a President who's an engineer or a scientist.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.040]   What do you think is the role of a President,
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.720]   like President Obama, in understanding
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.440]   the latest ideas in science and tech?
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:08.760]   What was that experience like?
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.680]   - Well, first of all, I've met other Presidents
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.720]   beside President Obama.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.760]   He is the most extraordinary President
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.720]   I've ever encountered.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.960]   - Despite the fact that he went to Harvard.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.440]   - When I think about President Obama,
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.560]   he is a deep mystery to me,
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.080]   in the same way, perhaps, that the universe is a mystery.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.640]   I don't really understand how that constellation
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.940]   of personality traits could come to fit
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.600]   within a single individual.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.000]   But I saw them for seven years,
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.120]   so I'm convinced that I wasn't seeing fake news.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.640]   I was seeing real data.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.780]   He was just an extraordinary man.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:50.640]   And one of the things that was completely clear
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:55.000]   was that he was not afraid
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.200]   and not intimidated to be in a room of really smart people.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.800]   I mean, really smart people.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.720]   That he was completely comfortable
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.840]   in asking some of the world's greatest experts,
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.640]   what do I do about this problem?
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:15.680]   And it wasn't that he was going to just take their answer,
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.640]   but he would listen to the advice.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.260]   And that, to me, was extraordinary.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.200]   As I said, I've been around other Executives
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.040]   and I've never seen one quite like him.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:30.480]   He's an extraordinary learner, is what I observed.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.080]   And not just about science.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.720]   He has a way of internalizing information
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.320]   in real time that I've never seen in a politician before,
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.640]   even in extraordinarily complicated situations.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.880]   - Even scientific ideas.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.280]   - Scientific or non-scientific.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.120]   Complicated ideas don't have to be scientific ideas.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.320]   But I have, like I said, seen him in real time
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.260]   process complicated ideas with a speed that was stunning.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:56.560]   In fact, he shocked the entire Council.
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.480]   I mean, we were all stunned at his capacity
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   to be presented with complicated ideas
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.800]   and then to wrestle with them and internalize them
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.600]   and then come back, more interestingly enough,
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.200]   come back with really good questions to ask.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.360]   - I've noticed this in the area that I understand more
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.440]   of artificial intelligence.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.960]   I've seen him integrate information
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.360]   about artificial intelligence and then come out
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.560]   with these kind of Richard Feynman-like insights.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.600]   - That's exactly right.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.920]   And that's, as I said, those of us who have been
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.320]   in that position, it is stunning to see it happen
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.200]   because you don't expect it.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.400]   - Yeah, he takes what, for a lot of sort of graduate students
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.480]   takes like four years in a particular topic
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.200]   and he just does it in a few minutes.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.600]   - He sees it very naturally.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.440]   - You've mentioned that you would love to see
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.060]   experimental validation of super strength theory
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.240]   before you--
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.500]   - Before I shuffle off this mortal coil.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.400]   - Which the poetry of that reference made me smile
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.780]   when I saw it.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.440]   - You know, people actually misunderstand that
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.700]   because it's not what, it doesn't mean what we generally
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.980]   take it to mean colloquially,
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.660]   but it's such a beautiful expression.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:09.500]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:14.120]   It's from the Hamlet to be or not to be speech,
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.780]   which I still don't understand what that's about,
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.920]   but so many interpretations.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:23.060]   Anyway, what are the most exciting problems in physics
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:25.620]   that are just within our reach of understanding
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.700]   and maybe solve the next few decades
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.020]   that you may be able to see?
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.140]   - So in physics, you limited it to physics.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.740]   - Physics, mathematics, this kind of space of problems
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:37.840]   that fascinate you.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:42.020]   - Well, the one that looks on the immediate horizon
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.300]   like we're gonna get to is quantum computing.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.900]   And that's gonna, if we actually get there,
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:50.900]   that's gonna be extraordinarily interesting.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.320]   - Do you think that's a fundamentally problem of theory
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.180]   or is it now in the space of engineering?
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.340]   - It's in the space of engineering.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:01.700]   I was out at Q Station, as you may know,
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:06.700]   Microsoft has this research facility in Santa Barbara.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:10.060]   I was out there a couple of months in my capacity
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.820]   as a vice president of American Physical Society.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.780]   And I got, you know, I had some things
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.640]   that were like lectures and they were telling me
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:17.700]   what they were doing.
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:20.660]   And it sure sounded like they knew what they were doing
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.060]   and that they were close to major breakthroughs.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.680]   - Yeah, that's a really exciting possibility there.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.680]   But back to Hamlet, do you ponder mortality?
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.920]   - No. - Your own mortality?
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.760]   - Nope.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.180]   My mother died when I was 11 years old.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:41.180]   And so I immediately knew what the end of the story was
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.820]   for all of us.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.880]   As a consequence, I've never spent a lot of time
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:47.960]   thinking about death.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.200]   It'll come in its own good time.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.480]   And sort of, to me, the job of every human
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.680]   is to make the best and the most of the time
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:01.240]   that's given to us in order, not for our own selfish gain,
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.040]   but to try to make this place a better place
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:06.180]   for someone else.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:13.720]   - And on the why of life, why do you think we are?
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.620]   - I have no idea and I never even worried about it.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:21.120]   For me, I have an answer, a local answer.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.680]   The apparent why for me was
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.260]   because I'm supposed to do physics.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:28.400]   - But it's funny because there's so many other
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:33.460]   quantum mechanically speaking possibilities in your life,
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.720]   such as being an astronaut, for example.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.320]   - So you know about that, I see.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.160]   (laughing)
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.160]   Well, like Einstein and the vicissitudes
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   that prevented the 1914 measurement of starlight bending,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.740]   the universe is constructed in such a way
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.140]   that I didn't become an astronaut,
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.440]   which would have, for me, I would have faced
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.160]   the worst choice in my life,
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:04.560]   whether I would try to become an astronaut
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.440]   or whether I would try to do theoretical physics.
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.120]   Both of these dreams were born
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.640]   when I was four years old simultaneously.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.680]   And so I can't imagine how difficult
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.000]   that decision would have been.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.520]   - The universe helped you out on that one.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.760]   - Not only on that one, but in many ones.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.400]   It helped me out by allowing me to pick the right dad.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.900]   - Is there a day in your life you could relive
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:29.720]   because it made you truly happy?
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.720]   What day would that be, if you could just look back?
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.480]   - Being a theoretical physicist
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.480]   is like having Christmas every day.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.000]   (laughing)
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.780]   I have lots of joy in my life.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.000]   - The moments of invention, the moments of ideas,
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.760]   revelation, just-- - Yes.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.560]   The only thing that exceed them are some family experiences,
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:54.840]   like when my kids were born and that kind of stuff.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.840]   But they're pretty high up there.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.520]   - Well, I don't see a better way to end it, Jim.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.360]   Thank you so much.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.280]   It was a huge honor talking to you today.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.400]   - This worked out better than I thought.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.840]   (laughing)
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.600]   - Glad to hear it.

[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.720]   from the great Albert Einstein for the rebels among us.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.960]   "Unthinking respect for authority
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.160]   "is the greatest enemy of truth."
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.260]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
