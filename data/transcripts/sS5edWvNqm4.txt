[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.240]   - A podcast listener named Bryce writes in to ask this,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.840]   "Pastor John, I just listened to episode number 296
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.800]   "where you describe what biblical inerrancy actually is.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.900]   "Now that I know how you define inerrancy,
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.960]   "my question to you is this.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.700]   "Why do you personally believe the Bible is trustworthy?"
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.980]   - That's a fair and a very important question.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.960]   I feel the importance of it right now
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.200]   because I just spent six weeks writing a book
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.120]   to answer the question.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.700]   So this will be difficult to keep short,
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.240]   but I think I can do it.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   The answer, how the Bible gives a well-grounded,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.960]   and I think that phrase matters,
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.960]   a well-grounded conviction about its truthfulness
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.240]   or its inerrancy,
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.840]   and I'm using those two words interchangeably.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.420]   Inerrancy is just the negative way
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.440]   of saying completely truthful, and I believe both.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.280]   I'm okay with both of those words.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.240]   The answer to that question has many angles and aspects.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.480]   People have come at this so many different ways.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.720]   So let me just mention three
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.440]   that seem most important to me,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.280]   and I'm gonna jumble them all together
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.440]   so you'll lose track of what the three are probably,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.600]   but it has to do with the glory of God,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.980]   the nature of the word of God,
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.600]   and the claims of the Scripture.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.480]   Those would be the three,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.440]   and you can look for them in this jumble.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.800]   I take my starting point from the analogy
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.700]   that God expects us to see His glory,
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.080]   be sure of His glory, know His glory,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.200]   be convinced of His glory, His reality,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.960]   through its revelation in nature, Romans 1:20.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.840]   His invisible attributes, namely His eternal power
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.320]   and divine nature, have been clearly perceived
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.520]   in the things that have been made,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.500]   so they are without excuse, for they knew God.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.280]   Though they knew God, knew God,
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.400]   they did not glorify Him as God or give Him thanks.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   They exchanged the glory of God for the glory of images.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   So God, people are without excuse
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.440]   if they do not see and treasure
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.000]   the glory of God revealed in nature.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   If they don't glorify Him and thank Him,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.480]   God holds man accountable to see,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   to be convinced by, to worship the spiritual beauty of God
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.920]   through the material universe.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.280]   Just think of it, He expects us to see it,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.760]   and you can't put spiritual beauty, glory of God,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.960]   in a test tube for empirical proof or testing.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.080]   You see it or you don't see it,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.160]   and God holds us responsible to see it.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.720]   Now, that's all an analogy for me.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.980]   I think the same thing is true of God's Word.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.480]   In fact, the more I think about it,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.380]   the more obvious that would be.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.960]   If God puts a world out there and says,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.120]   know me through it, how much more if He put,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.760]   if He put a word out there,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.560]   would He assume, see me in it, know me through it?
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.920]   And I think Paul points us in that direction,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.720]   namely that God holds us accountable
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.360]   for seeing the glory of God in His Word
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.080]   the way He holds us accountable
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.400]   for seeing the glory of God in His world.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.080]   We can know the Bible is God's Word
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.360]   the same way we know the world is God's world.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.040]   Same dynamics, same principle.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.960]   And the text that points me in that direction
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.800]   is 2 Corinthians 4, verses four and six.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   The God of this world, that's Satan,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.880]   has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.760]   from, here's the phrase,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.640]   who is the image of God.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.160]   So there's a light of the gospel.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.000]   When the gospel is spoken,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.680]   there's a glory of Christ shining in it that we're to see.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.000]   And then verse six, the God who said
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.080]   in His making of the world,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.100]   let light shine out of darkness,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.100]   has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.320]   of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.080]   So God moves into our heart.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.020]   He removes the blinders and He enables us in the Word,
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.980]   the narrative, the story of the gospel
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.560]   to see the glory of God so that we know
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.240]   this is God's gospel like we know this is God's world.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.040]   So Paul says, when the story of the gospel,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   the Word, is truly, fully spoken,
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.640]   it is the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.040]   who is the image of God.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.880]   And from this, I think Paul affirms
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.800]   that the glory of God is seen in the Word of God.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.120]   For Paul, the gospel is an articulable Word.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   And that glory is like light to the eye of the human heart.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.960]   We see the glory of God and it is self-evident
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.700]   this is the glory of God.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.200]   And thus, this is the glory of God's Word
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.620]   in which it is shining.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.600]   This is God's Word like that is God's world.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.360]   And from that experience of mine
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.640]   with the Word over the years,
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.160]   and that conviction that God expects us
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   to see Him and His self-authenticating glory in His Word,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.380]   from that experience and that conviction,
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.380]   I move to my second point, namely, God's Word is true.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:28.240]   The sum of your Word is truth, Psalm 119.60.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.220]   Every word it proves true.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.220]   So if this is God's Word, it is true, it is inerrant.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.860]   And part of this is the witness,
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.580]   this is my third thing now,
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.540]   part of this truth is the witness of God's Word to itself
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.140]   that it cannot be broken, John 10.35.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.780]   Thus, scriptures cannot be broken.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.060]   So as you move from this first, broad, stunning,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.300]   self-authenticating experience with the Word of God
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.660]   whereby God says, "This is my Word and this is my glory,"
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.580]   and you move from there to God speaks the truth
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.060]   and you move from there to God says things about His Word,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.660]   your sense and your conviction
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.580]   of the inerrancy of Scripture grows.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.100]   And I would just commend Kevin DeYoung's new book,
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.980]   "Taking God at His Word,"
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.860]   where he spells out many of these texts
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.040]   about what the Bible teaches about itself.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.980]   Now, maybe one last thing.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.500]   If you would push on me personally, about my experience
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   of how I am compelled to believe the Bible is God's Word
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.340]   and thus inerrant, I would zero in on Jesus and Paul.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.060]   I mean, this is biography now.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.020]   It's not trying to say the Bible says this.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.840]   It's just how John Piper experiences God through the Bible
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.260]   and comes to his conviction
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.060]   about the inerrancy of the Bible.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.500]   I zero in on Jesus and Paul.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.700]   The more I have looked, I'm 69,
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.540]   been reading the Bible since I was five, probably.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.180]   I have looked at the,
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.860]   the more I've looked at the teachings
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.300]   and the deeds of Jesus over the years,
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.480]   as they're given to us in the four Gospels,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.220]   I am compelled, like this is no big choice on my part.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.220]   I am compelled to say, I have seen His glory.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.540]   His glory as of the Son from the Father,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.460]   John 1:14 has become my experience.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.660]   We beheld His glory, glory as the only Son from the Father.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.660]   So He and all His words and all His work are words of truth
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.820]   because He is the truth.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.360]   He has confirmed Himself, stood forth,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.220]   revealed His glory to me.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.180]   I cannot walk away from Jesus.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.700]   I cannot see Him any other way
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.660]   than as the glorious one that He is.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.820]   And the second thing,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.380]   the more I read the letters of Paul,
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.220]   the more I am compelled to say, He's no fool.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.420]   He's no lunatic.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.940]   He's no charlatan.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.380]   He is more real than any fallen man,
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.500]   any other fallen man.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.580]   He's not Jesus.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.140]   He's just more real than any other fallen man
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.260]   I have ever known.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.380]   He is authentic, and so is His message.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.140]   So Jesus and Paul, in their own unique ways,
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.620]   are compelling embodiments of the glory of God
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.500]   in the face of Christ.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.580]   One as God, and the other as a faithful witness to God.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.000]   They are true, and what they say about all the scriptures
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.620]   is enough for me to trust them,
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.720]   to mention the fact that they too shine
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.420]   with the glory of God who inspired them.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.420]   So in a sentence, I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.420]   because of the divine origin of the Bible,
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.340]   and that divine origin is as evident
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.080]   as the divine origin of the universe.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.820]   - Outstanding, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.380]   And as you picked up, this is all overflow
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.380]   from John Piper's new book that he mentioned.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.420]   He just wrote it.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.120]   We talked more about this new book
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.740]   back in episode number 583,
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.940]   which was titled "The New Book John Piper Wrote."
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.500]   In that episode, if you listen to it,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.980]   you'll hear details about the book
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.300]   that you won't find anywhere else online.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.360]   And if you want the scoop,
