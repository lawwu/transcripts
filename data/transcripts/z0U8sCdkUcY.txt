[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Alright, well, it's our first podcast in July, so I think we should talk about the books
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.160]   I read last month, the books I read in June 2022.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.240]   As long-time listeners know, my goal is to read five books per month, which I do by making
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.640]   reading a default activity, by not using my phone for distraction, and by scheduling reading
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.960]   blocks on occasion into my actual time-blocked work schedule.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560]   So Jesse, I actually, for the first time, did not read five books.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.280]   I read six in June.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.640]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.080]   Well, because we had to deal with a week of COVID, so you can't do stuff, right?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.120]   You can't go and do other things outside of the house, so I read an extra book.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   While you were doing the RAR?
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.120]   While I was doing the RAR.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.120]   I didn't RAR with COVID.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   I probably should have.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.120]   You use it as an excuse, right?
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.120]   You're like, "Oh man, technically I have COVID, so like really..."
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.320]   You could have done the RAR.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320]   I need to eat.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.320]   I need to eat whatever.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320]   David Goggins would have told you to do the RAR.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.320]   David Goggins would have wrote.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320]   No, no.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.320]   You use it as an excuse.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.800]   I think we're leaving that phase, by the way, where people care and feel bad for you.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.400]   So you leave that phase, like, "I got to eat like crap.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.680]   I can't exercise."
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680]   Now you can.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.160]   You know it's just stuff you get on the RAR.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.640]   No, actually what I did...
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.840]   This wasn't during COVID, it was more recently.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.400]   I did this five day, like kind of intense daily free weight routine.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.680]   At your house?
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.880]   But that was after COVID.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880]   All right.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.160]   Anyways, six books I read in June 2022.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.680]   The order here is arbitrary.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.160]   Number one, Ball Four by Jim...
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   I think it's Booten.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.520]   I think I'm saying that right.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520]   You've heard of Ball Four?
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   Yeah, I have.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   The baseball book?
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   It's a baseball book.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.000]   It was written in the early 70s about a pitcher, Jim Booten, who was a Yankee.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   I mean, he was really good for the Yankees and then sort of became a journeyman for a
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   while.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960]   Anyways, it was a book about a year in the life and it's actually written diary format.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.800]   And it's famous because it was the first book about baseball that pulled back the curtain
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.960]   on what life was actually like for these professional athletes.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.760]   I mean, it gets into the amphetamines they would take and the carousing with women and
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.400]   the drinking.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.960]   I think this was the book that first revealed, kind of broke the myth of Mickey Mantle, the
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.520]   fact that he hit a home run while drunk.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   And so it pulled back the curtain and it was sort of a big controversy, but it's really
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.980]   influential book for a lot of people because it was the first, this is what sports is really
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.640]   like.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   I read it for a book group.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.080]   I'm in a book group, Jesse.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.320]   Not something I would normally think to do given how much of my life professionally I
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.480]   spend reading and writing, but it's a sports book only book group.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.600]   And I read sports books as a way to relax because they're completely unrelated to what
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.440]   I write about normally.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.960]   So I figured that'd be a good book group to join.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.520]   So you guys meet once a month?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.840]   I mean, last night was our first meeting, so I've only done it once.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   The book was ball four?
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840]   Ball four.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   So I'm officially in a book group.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.000]   The style is interesting in ball four.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's diary.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.020]   I mean, day every day, March 17th, April 28th.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.640]   And he would take notes during the day and then talk into a tape recorder at night.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   And then it got edited.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.520]   He had a kind of a ghost writer and they would edit it, but it's almost impressionistic,
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   right?
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.560]   I mean, if you read now a sort of sports autobiography, it'll follow through time, but there's plot
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.240]   lines it's following and it's written in a way that's a little bit more coherent.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.680]   This is more impressionistic.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.860]   This happened, here's an observation.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.200]   You will come back to plot lines, but not in a very structured way.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.480]   I mean, it's almost like early modernism, cubism and art being moved over to narrative
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   nonfiction.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.260]   It's the Mademoiselle, the Dabin Young of sports book.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.600]   It's just impressionistic and it's 500 pages of just doom and this and this happened and
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   that happened.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.540]   And over time it's very effective.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.240]   You get a very layered understanding of life as a player without any carefully constructed
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.400]   narratives without carefully constructed structured chapters.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.520]   So there's some sort of interesting experimental thing going on.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.480]   I haven't seen a lot of that in books since.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.440]   Who was the manager then?
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.200]   So this follows the, I think the 69 season where he spent a year at an expansion team.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.360]   It was the Seattle pilot, which then became the Brewers.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.760]   Got it.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   So it was interesting.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   All right.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:43.440]   Other interesting book I read, Take the Gun, Leave the Cannoli by Mark Seal.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.080]   It's a account of the filming of the first Godfather.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.440]   So that's a, it's a quote from the first Godfather.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.240]   Mark Seal, I think is a Vanity Fair reporter.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.160]   And I was going to California.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.720]   I was going to wine country, Francis Ford Coppola, you know, has vineyards up there.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.320]   And so it felt appropriate to read a book about the making of the Godfather.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   So it was interesting.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.200]   And it gets into Rob Evans and Mark Puzo and, and, and, you know, how the movie came together.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.600]   And those are kind of interesting books to read.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   And it's the 50th anniversary too, right?
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   Oh, interesting.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   And this is an older book, but my timing was good then.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   The 50th anniversary is like a couple of months ago.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.160]   So Puzo went through this whole thing about the record for paperback rights.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:37.280]   So Puzo got, I think 500,000 for the paperback rights to the Godfather would set the record.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.080]   And because Stephen King got 400,000 for Carrie kind of around the same time.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.040]   So that was, that was the sort of records back then for rights was like four or $500,000.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.600]   And that was back when paperback rights were something you sold separately.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.640]   And that's where you made all your money no longer today.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.120]   All right.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.200]   Then I read every tool is a hammer by Adam Savage, former myth busters.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.080]   It's his memoir, an interesting memoir.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.480]   He'll work in advice about workshops and making with the story of his own life and his personal
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.600]   philosophy.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.320]   Adam Savage, his critical connection to this show we do here is that he has the cave, which
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.640]   is this really cool warehouse in the mission district of San Francisco, which is his personal
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   workshop.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.360]   And it's this a cool, amazing space he goes to.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.120]   And part of the inspiration for the deep work HQ was that he, he has this, this was his
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.320]   dream to have a dedicated space that what he does is builds things.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.040]   And it's this huge, cool workshop.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.320]   Just like we have a dedicated space to come and record and in theory think.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.640]   And so I liked the cave.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.040]   I like his videos on tested.com.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   Interesting guy.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.560]   Did it talk about the cave in the book?
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.600]   And he started his first cave was like in a basement of a rental house.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.120]   And then after myth busters was doing really well and he made, made money is when he leased
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.800]   out, leased out this space.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   It's interesting there.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.360]   I think they're having crime problems in the neighborhood.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.100]   Like they don't, they don't nearly as much anymore.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.600]   Have cameraman come film in there.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.960]   He'll self film himself in there, which he was doing during COVID during the, like the
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   lockdowns, but then he kept doing it even though now it's obviously not COVID concerns
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   because he does lots of videos with other people in other places.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.320]   And I heard him say somewhere that it's because the cars are getting broken into so he can
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.120]   walk to the cave from his house.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.720]   So he can go there and film himself.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.640]   But when a crew would come just like clockwork, their cars are getting broken into.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.720]   So there's a lot of self filming happening.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   There you go.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.440]   A little bit of, uh, Adam Savage trivia right there, but it was a good book.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.680]   He talked, I mean, it's, you'll learn about glue, but also learn about, you know, his
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.560]   time at ILM and his struggles.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.480]   I mean, so it's like, I think it's a really creative book.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   I enjoyed it.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.480]   All right.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.880]   So next I read Cod by Mark Kurlansky.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880]   I like Kurlansky.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.080]   There was a period in the, this would have been the early two thousands where these books
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.440]   were really big, where you would take one topic, uh, Kurlansky wrote Cod and then he
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.000]   wrote salt, but there was like a book about pencils that was really big at this time.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.720]   And you take one topic and you go deep on that topic.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.060]   And in going deep on that topic, you learn a lot about history.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.120]   And Cod was one of the first books to do that.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.080]   I, I, I, when I lived in new England, I read this and salt.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   I love those books.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.920]   So it's the history of Cod and Cod fishing, but you learn the history of Europe and colonial
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.680]   America and all of these different things, um, beautifully written and he mixes it with
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.600]   recipes, but historical recipes.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.960]   Like here's a recipe for preparing Cod from 1727 and it's all mixed together.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.680]   It's a, it's a really nice, uh, innovative, beautifully constructed book.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.520]   So it was a reread?
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.120]   That I think I probably read at some point.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.360]   Back in new England, 10, 15 years ago.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.480]   Have you tried any of the recipes?
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.720]   Well they're historic recipes.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.400]   So we have cooked Cod though.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   Cod's good.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.960]   Uh, then I read, cause this is my weird compulsion.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.200]   I don't know why I read these books, but I keep reading these types of books.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.880]   Uh, another Bill Carter book, desperate networks.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.600]   So Bill Carter is, you know, New York times TV reporter, desperate networks.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.360]   It's just a book about like a five year period after NBC's must see TV lineup was, you know,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   friends and Seinfeld had all kind of disappeared and how NBC fell and ABC and CBS made their
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   move.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.240]   So ABC got lost in desperate housewives and CB CBS got CSI.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.480]   It just, that's it.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.480]   Like Bill Carter just writes these books every so often years, he'll like take a period of
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   time and write about it.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.480]   So the last one I wrote, read by him and talked about on the show is late shift about what
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.520]   happened after Johnny Carson retired.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.600]   I don't know why I'm so interested in these books about the inside baseball of network
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.720]   television, but I find them relaxing and interesting.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.120]   Basically just comes down to ratings and that just gets more advertisers, right?
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.120]   Is that how it's determined?
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.520]   And, and, well, but how these shows come together, it's all kind of guesswork.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.880]   I, I, so I'll tell you the, the anecdote I've extracted from this book, that's going to
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.040]   make it into slow productivity.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.160]   I'll preview this anecdote now because I'm always reading, looking towards anecdotes.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:25.600]   They talk about CBS was really struggling and I think it was less moonves who took over.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   I might have that wrong.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.560]   I'll go back and I listened to it, but I have to buy the book to get the quotes out of it.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.640]   And he was upset that the offices were emptying.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.800]   There'll be three o'clock on a Friday and the office would be half full and he's a people
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.120]   aren't taking at the CBS headquarters there in in Manhattan where I've been, because I've
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.280]   done some CBS stuff.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   People aren't here.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   We need energy.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.800]   He's like, NBC was number one.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   They probably had a lot of energy.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.960]   So everyone has to be in the office.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.240]   You can't leave till after five.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.200]   And if you step back, you say, yeah, under him, CBS did rock it up to be much more successful.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.520]   Why I think it's an interesting anecdote though, is as Bill Carter gets into exactly what happened,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.880]   why did CBS become more successful because all of the executives and ad people and HR
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.080]   people are in the office till five?
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.520]   No, it was because of CSI.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.020]   And when you hear the story of CSI and Bill Carter, it's actually the story of a, of someone
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.200]   spending a lot of time thinking through and polishing this concept.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.120]   And it's a slow productivity parable.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.200]   Less moonves thought was important for success is that everyone was busier and more visibly
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   active.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.920]   And in the end, what actually saved the company was something that was very slow and creative.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:44.280]   And there's this story of this, this television writer who had, had, had a, had gone up in
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.960]   his career and had fallen and had gotten obsessed with this idea and slowly developed something
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.480]   of such value that it saved an entire network.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   So I'm going to pull that together in the book.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.960]   You'll see when the book finally comes out into a cool reversal anecdote about, you know,
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.120]   less moonves didn't save the company by making everyone more busy, but instead it was this
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:10.560]   guy whose name I forgot, but we'll obviously learn, um, slowing down and, and, and inhabiting
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.080]   this idea that ended up actually making the difference.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.880]   So there's a little proto idea that by the time it comes into my book will be quite polished.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.720]   So that, that alone made it worth reading that book.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.000]   I think a final thing I read, it was June summer.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.360]   I love to read adventure books and thrillers.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.160]   I read David Morrell's first blood.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.800]   So first blood it's known now is the first Rambo movie.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:43.200]   So John Rambo is the, this is the book that introduced John Rambo, but people don't remember
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.680]   properly the lineage of Rambo.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:55.640]   So first blood is this, this book about political polarization post Vietnam.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.200]   And it's, uh, it was used to be taught in colleges a lot.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.960]   And it's, it's really the plot of the book is that John Rambo, former green Beret, who
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.680]   had been, had this traumatic experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and is now sort
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.440]   of a drifter, just sort of walking through across the countryside has a run in with the,
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   the straight lay police sheriff in this small town.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.840]   And I think it's in the, I forgot where it is in the movie at specific Northwest.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.120]   I think this is like Virginia or something.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.880]   And he snaps and, uh, he snaps the PTSD snaps.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.960]   He kills one of the police officers flees into the woods.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   The police come after him.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.760]   Long story short, he basically kills everyone, but the chief and then the national guard
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.200]   comes back and it says back and forth.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.920]   But the way David Morrell wrote the book is alternating viewpoints, Rambo police chief,
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   Rambo police chief.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.720]   And he was very clear that there's no clear hero or anti-hero.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   It's not, this is the good guy.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   This is the bad guy.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.200]   The whole point of the book was the ambiguity.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.760]   To kind of understand the police chief and the he's, he's been divorced and the issues
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   he's having his life.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.600]   And you understand Rambo and the PTSD, and you're not even sure who's the good guy, who's
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   the bad guy.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.680]   And that was the whole point of the book, because that's the weird ambivalence of the post Vietnam
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.520]   era polarization.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.600]   It was this messy time where it was unclear who was right and who was wrong.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.960]   And so it's actually like a really interesting book and they made it into the movie first
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.900]   blood, the first Rambo movie starring Sylvester Stallone.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.760]   And the movie is not like you think about with Rambo.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.720]   I mean, it's a, it's shot like today we would see it more like an indie film.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.240]   It's in the early seventies and it's a small movie.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.160]   I did invent some very important tropes that this is one of the very first sort of had
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.600]   some of the very first tropes that action movies of the eighties would then pull from,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.840]   but it's not a, it's not a recognizable shoot them up action movie.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.960]   So it's, it's, it's like a small movie.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   I rewatched it.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.000]   I've had some, some guys that we do a movie club.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.120]   We rewatched it not too long ago.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.560]   Then after that was very successful, they did Rambo two and by Rambo two now, Sylvester
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.160]   Stallone has biceps roughly the size of a cantaloupe and he's holding M sixties under
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.600]   both arms and has the red bandana and he goes back to Vietnam and he's, you know, the body
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   counts pile up.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.280]   It became the cliched sort of this weird over the top Reagan era rah, rah, rah movie.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.760]   But first blood was not that.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.280]   And the first blood movie was not that.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.520]   So I went back and read the original novel.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.440]   Um, that's pretty good.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.720]   He it's, he just kills everybody, but he's, it's, it's psychologically interesting.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.800]   Like there's, he's broken and the police chief is at anyways, in the end they both die.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.320]   They kill each other in the spoiler alert.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320]   They kill each other in the end.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.360]   I mean, it's kind of an interesting book, but David Morrell said after the second Rambo
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.400]   movie came out, they stopped teaching the book in colleges because the second Rambo
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.600]   movie was very much associated with like rah, rah Reaganism and you know, mindless action
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.520]   and it tainted his original work and they stopped teaching it.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.080]   So there you go.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.320]   David Morrell first blood.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   All right.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   Those are my six.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:09.640]   What was the beast of a book that you were reading like back in the springtime?
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.240]   Um, did you finish it?
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   I don't know.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.800]   I've had a, I've had a few beast recently.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.560]   I don't know which one in the spring might've been the beastiest.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.480]   I'd have to go back and look at our, are you still working through like a beast of a book
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.480]   right now?
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.960]   Franklin's a beast of a book.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.960]   I'm 200.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.320]   I mean, ball four was a beast of a book just in length.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   It's not hard.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.160]   It's not a hard read, but it's 500 pages.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.600]   Franklin's five or 600 pages.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   And it's small.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.160]   It is making me feel old.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.480]   It's reading glasses small.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.880]   You know, probably read a lot of books about Franklin, right?
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.480]   I mean, I read Gordon Woods book, uh, Americanization of Ben Franklin and Gordon.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.720]   What is great Gordon?
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:57.240]   What is, uh, well, brands is an academic too, but what is, um, the most academic of the
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.580]   semi-public facing writers about colonial history.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:08.400]   So he's great on the philosophical context of, of the revolution, like the, the currents
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.960]   of thought going on in England and specifically like what Jefferson had read and what was
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.600]   going on, uh, the, the impacts of these various rebellions that were happening in the English
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.200]   countryside in the 18th century and how they influenced what was happening in America.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:32.360]   So like, if you really want, I think what's at Brown, he's more academic brands is he's
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:38.440]   a distinguished professor at UT Austin, but he writes more.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.560]   He's a beautiful writer, but he's also like McCullough or someone he, he, he's writing
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.720]   for a non-academic art audience, but that's a piece of a book that's 600 pages.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.840]   Um, so that, that might take me a minute.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   I'm reading four books concurrently right now.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.920]   I just, I'm jumping between things.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.080]   I'm finding things I like.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.040]   I'm just, I'm just all over the place right now.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   Any audio?
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   Um, what am I listening to an audio?
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.640]   Ooh, golden eye.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   It's a book.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.360]   It was, it's free on audible right now.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.280]   So if you have audible, it's free right now.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:18.160]   And it's the story of the house that Ian Fleming built in Jamaica when he turned 40.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160]   And it's where he wrote all the James Bond novels.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.120]   So it's, it's a Jamaican history.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.000]   Like what was going on in Jamaica.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.920]   It's the colonial relationship between Britain, Jamaica, who was living there, all these different
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:36.520]   my, uh, lesser aristocrats and others, and Ian Fleming coming there and building this
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.540]   house and, and where he, he wrote all of his books.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.880]   And so I'm enjoying that.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.400]   Here, I'll just give the quick bullet.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.640]   I always say I'm always pattern, pattern matching, interesting bullet points.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.800]   The interesting bullet points is one.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.120]   So after the war, so, you know, Fleming served, uh, with intelligence during the war.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.160]   This was, if you want to look up, uh, British privilege after the war, he went to get a
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.800]   job at, at a paper and he was going to be the foreign reporter for some paper run by
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.680]   Lord someone, someone he's like, here's the thing.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:15.480]   I need three months off a year to go to Jamaica and Lord so-and-so was like, good show old
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   chop.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   That's fine.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.680]   You can take three months off a year so you can go to Jamaica.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.820]   That seems reasonable.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.200]   So then he goes and builds this house.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.180]   So he'd visited Jamaica in the war.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.860]   And so he goes and builds this house in Jamaica and just partying is partying at this house.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.860]   It's not very nice.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.700]   I mean, it's a beautiful overlook in the water, but the house it's, it's, uh, there's no windows.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.700]   It's just Louvers.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.260]   So it's like full of bugs at night and the bathroom doesn't really work, but you know,
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.660]   he's just partying and womanizing.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:45.180]   So he builds it when he's 40, he's just out there drinking and womanizing and then gets
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.940]   his mistress pregnant when he's 43.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.940]   Now he's all freaking out.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.980]   He's like, I can't be a dad.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.340]   I can't raise a kid or whatever.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.340]   I don't know.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.340]   He's all freaking out.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.740]   So she's like, look, you need to distract yourself.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.820]   Um, yeah, you can't just be carousing womanizing.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.140]   Why don't you write like while you're out here?
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.180]   And so at 43, he's out there at Jamaica freaking out about having a kid and writes casino Roy,
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.180]   casino Royale.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.180]   Wow.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.620]   And he gets it down to a science where he can write these, he, the, he writes one novel
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.900]   per annual Jamaica visit.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:23.700]   So in three months, one novel right in the morning and again in the afternoon, overlooking
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.700]   the water with the swim in between.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.980]   Yeah, he's got it figured out.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:35.420]   The downside is he smoked 80 cigarettes a day, which if you do the math is constant,
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.040]   it has to, you have to light one with the other.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.900]   So a spoiler alert, Ian Fleming did not live to a ripe old age, dead at 57, but he did
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   some damage.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.180]   Anyway, so I'm listening to that.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.140]   So, so more, more on that when we report on the July books.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.900]   (upbeat music)
