[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   Okay, and final question, since this is our user conference and you are such a high profile
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   user of OpenAI, I'm curious if you could say a little bit about how OpenAI uses Weights
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.280]   and Biases and if you have a favorite feature or part of Weights and Biases, we'd love to
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280]   know about that.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.000]   Yeah, I mean, we use it for pretty much all of our model training.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.160]   So just tracking them, I think there's a lot of just sharing of like, the fact that you
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.320]   can easily share training runs and stuff like that, it's a super used feature.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.400]   But I think one thing that these days I do way, way less of that sort of work.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.360]   So one of the features I really like is the ability to have reports and so on, where people...
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360]   So we use that quite heavily.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.880]   It depends a little bit on the team, but a number of teams are using that quite heavily
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.280]   to kind of really have a clear hypothesis.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.880]   Here's the hypothesis, here are the experiments that were run to kind of validate or invalidate
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.400]   that hypothesis, here's the conclusion.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.000]   You have all these mini scientific papers, essentially, on all of the stuff that's happening
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.360]   at OpenAI, which is incredibly interesting to kind of follow along with.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.360]   Fantastic.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.240]   That sounds very interesting.
