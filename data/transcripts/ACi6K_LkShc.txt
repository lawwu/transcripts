[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   I mean, I think it's important sometimes to distinguish between pharmacologic and physiologic
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.440]   effects.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.640]   So physiologic is what the hormone naturally does in your body and what can be modulated
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.480]   by natural things like eating a different food.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.520]   And you might get a twofold change in your GLP-1 by eating a different food, you know,
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   one food versus the other.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.760]   But as we know from those DPP-4 inhibitors, it's not going to really change your appetite
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.200]   because the drugs increase it threefold.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.560]   These GLP-1 agonists are really a pharmacologic effect, an effect that only happens with drugs.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.800]   So you get 1,000 to 10,000-fold higher concentrations of these drugs in your blood than the natural
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   hormone.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.200]   And so it's just, there's no diet that's ever going to give you that.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.000]   And there's no precedent for it either.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.320]   So should we be at all concerned about that?
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.400]   I mean, they run clinical trials and address safety.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.520]   But when you're talking about 1,000-fold increase in essentially a peptide hormone, if we were
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.400]   talking about different peptide hormone, you know, pick one, you know, oxytocin or estrogen,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.840]   testosterone, they're not really, you know, broadly speaking, most people would be concerned
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.220]   about 1,000-fold dosing of something like that.
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.080]   And obviously there are clinical indications where that's important.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.880]   However, my observation of the ever-expanding literature on GLP-1 agonists is that there
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.160]   seems to be improvements in like reduction in alcohol consumption.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.760]   And by the way, why would increasing GLP-1 reduce craving for alcohol?
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.000]   It seems like there's an ever-expanding list of things that GLP-1 agonism is good for.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.120]   But we are talking about, I would say, supraphysiological levels when one takes it.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.960]   And again, I'm not against it nor for it, I'm just paying attention to the literature.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.080]   I would say that that's absolutely right.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.640]   When you're increasing the level of a hormone 1,000-fold, you need to be careful, see what's
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   happening.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.880]   But at the end, it's an empirical question.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.360]   What does it actually do to a person?
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.280]   And it can only be answered through experiments.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   And I think the nice thing about these GLP-1 drugs that a lot of people don't realize is
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.720]   they've been around and approved since 2005, the earliest ones.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.040]   And even something like Ozempic, which maybe only entered the public consciousness in the
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.700]   last year or two, right, it's been around for seven-ish years, I think, and big clinical
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.080]   trials with these drugs.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.280]   And the evidence so far is that they seem to be incredibly safe.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.760]   And as you said, not just incredibly safe, but they seem to have all these unexpected
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.800]   health benefits that seem to be, in some cases, even unrelated to weight loss.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.320]   And so, because of the reasons you mentioned, one of the things the FDA requires from these
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.880]   pharmaceutical companies for diabetes drugs is these large cardiac outcome trials, so
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.600]   basically where you measure stroke and where you measure heart attacks and death from any
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   cardiac cause.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.160]   Big trials, like 20,000 people, four years, cost like a billion dollars to run.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.080]   And the data from the semaglutide, the Ozempic trial, came out last year and, as expected,
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.640]   reduced the rate of heart attacks, strokes, all-cause mortality, according to cardiac,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.640]   for cardiac reasons.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   But what's really surprising was a lot of that seemed to happen before the people even
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240]   lost weight.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.640]   So there was already a difference between the placebo group and the semaglutide group
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.800]   before the people on the drug had lost a significant amount of weight.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.600]   And there was no correlation between the amount of weight they lost and how well they were
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.240]   protected from heart disease.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.880]   And that's led many people to think that some of these effects actually could be due
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.760]   to other things the GLP-1s are doing that we didn't expect.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.520]   And so one thing is there's an idea emerging that they are anti-inflammatory.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.280]   So these brain regions, the areoposteum and the NTS, are also really important for this
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.000]   reflex, known as the inflammatory reflex, that basically acts, starts with the vagus
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.640]   nerve, goes to these brain regions in the brainstem, and then goes back down to the
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.240]   body to basically suppress, to prevent out-of-control inflammation.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.880]   And so it's thought that these drugs perhaps have an anti-inflammatory effect that explains
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   some of that.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   - It sounds like the patent on these drugs just got extended by another hundred years.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.680]   That's a biopharma joke.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.040]   - I mean, just to put context on it, drugs can be patented and sold as a commercial version
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.800]   and not as generic versions until the patent runs out, unless companies are able to find
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.120]   another approved clinical use, in which case it can be remarketed only as a brand name,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   not generic version.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.520]   So a lot of companies, once they do the safety testing and all, given everything they put
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.400]   into the R&D, into the research and development, there's a very big incentive to not necessarily
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.620]   finding new drugs, but finding new uses for the same drugs and not allowing generic versions
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.760]   into the picture.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.120]   And that's why it's likely to be, based on these, what sounds like additional uses of
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.400]   ozempic-related compounds, a long time before there's generic ozempic available.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.800]   - Yeah, I think it will be a while.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.400]   I don't know the exact status of the patents, but I'm guessing it's gonna be a while before
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.640]   there are generic versions, but there's a lot of competition coming.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.160]   So every major pharmaceutical company, or almost every major pharmaceutical company
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.920]   now has a GLP-1 program.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.280]   And some of them are really exciting, actually.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.640]   So I mean, the general trend in this area is what people call GLP-1+, which means you
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.160]   take the GLP-1 agonist, which is already giving you 15% weight loss or so, and then you add
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.680]   additional things to that to give it additional properties.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.240]   So one compound is from Eli Lilly, so there's this other drug on the market that we haven't
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.440]   talked about, but terzepatide, which is known as Moonjaro for diabetes and ZepBound for
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.200]   obesity, which is even better, really, in almost every respect, a better drug than ozempic.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.160]   People lose more weight, so it's about 21% weight loss at a year.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.720]   Fewer side effects, at least at comparable doses.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.640]   That seems to be because this other drug, terzepatide, it has two targets, not one.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.920]   Whereas ozempic is just GLP-1 receptor agonist, terzepatide is a dual agonist of GLP-1 and
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.280]   this other incretin that we talked about, JIP, G-I-P.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.440]   And it seems like having that JIP agonism actually acts as an anti-nausea effect, that
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.080]   sort of counteracts some of the nausea caused by the GLP-1 in the area post-treatment.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.280]   There are JIP receptor neurons in the area post-treatment, this nausea center, just sort
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.840]   of allows you to crank up the dose of the GLP-1 agonism even further while you're suppressing
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.120]   the nausea and just get even more weight loss.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.560]   So now, talking about the future, things that aren't available yet but will be in the next
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.560]   couple of years.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.840]   So Eli Lilly, the company that makes this drug, terzepatide/Mujaro, they have a triple
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.200]   agonist that's in phase three clinical trials now.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.000]   So this is now three hormones in one.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.160]   It's the GLP-1, which all these drugs have, the JIP, which is the anti-nausea component,
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.880]   and then glucagon itself.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.240]   And so these three hormones all combined in one pill.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.240]   And what the glucagon does is it increases energy expenditure.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.840]   This is a well-known effect of glucagon.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.700]   And so you're basically eating less, your nausea isn't as bad, and now you're just burning
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.280]   more calories at baseline.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.240]   And the results from this drug are incredible.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.260]   So basically, there's been one phase two trial published, and people lost 25% of their body
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.120]   weight at the end of the, I think it was 48-week period.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   And they were still losing weight.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   So we don't know where the end point.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.160]   We don't know what the maximum is.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.520]   So there are bigger, longer trials going on now to figure that out.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.420]   But at that point, when you get beyond 25% body weight, you're talking about basically
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.520]   bariatric surgery, which is currently the best thing we have, like these surgeries people
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   do to--
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   - Stomach staples.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   - Yeah.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   - Removing a portion of the stomach.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   - Removing a portion of the gut.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.240]   So really, it's a pharmacologic version of bariatric surgery.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.800]   The other one that I think is really exciting, there's this compound from Amgen, it's called,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:59.120]   right now it's just a code, it's like AMG-133, but it's like terzapotide in the sense that
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.600]   it targets both GLP-1 and GYP, so it's a dual targeted.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.320]   But unlike terzapotide, which activates the GYP receptor, this Amgen compound inhibits
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   it.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.360]   And for reasons that people don't understand, either activating or inhibiting this receptor
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.920]   causes you to lose weight.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.600]   So it's still a mystery, but a lot of debate about what's going on there.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.920]   But the way this Amgen compound activates the GYP receptor, or inhibits the GYP receptor
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.160]   rather, is that it's an antibody.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.760]   So all these other things were peptides, but this is a much bigger, it's an actual protein,
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.800]   this is an antibody.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.880]   Because it's an antibody, it has a much longer lifetime, even than something like semaglutide,
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.520]   which is seven days, so it lasts like a month in the blood or something.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.960]   And so you can give people monthly injections of this, and they lose dramatic amounts of
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.080]   weight.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.780]   And then at least in this initial trial, at the end of this they stopped, and people maintained
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.480]   the weight loss for six months.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.560]   That's impressive.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.560]   Potentially because of the long-lasting effects of this antibody, or potentially because of
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.480]   other things that we don't understand.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.080]   So those are just two, there's all sorts of other crazy things happening.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.920]   So really, I think it's just created this explosion of interest in pharma.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.680]   Basically, it's one of these things, once you see that something can be done, all of
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.760]   a sudden that changes everyone's perspective.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.740]   And so now, obesity drug discovery has gone from something that 10 years ago everyone
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.060]   wanted to stay away from, because there were so many nightmare stories about drugs that
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.880]   turned out to be not safe, until now everybody's sort of all in on this.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.240]   Yeah, I remember in college, the fen-fen debacle, where a diet drug was released and people
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.760]   had cardiac issues, started dying, so it was pulled from market.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.920]   And then it was essentially a quiet field for a long time.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.120]   Thank you for tuning in to the Huberman Lab Clips channel.
