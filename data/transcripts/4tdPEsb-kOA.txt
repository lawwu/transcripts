[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   - Welcome back to the podcast on this January 11th,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.600]   always a big day for us, the podcast, this podcast.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.520]   Ask Pastor John turns 10 years old today.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.600]   Episode number one aired on January 11th, 2013.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.620]   And more importantly, John Piper was born
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.440]   on January 11th, 1946.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.560]   He's 77 years young today.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.120]   So Pastor John, when you hear this episode,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.160]   happy birthday to you, my friend.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.520]   Thank you for this unforgettable decade on the podcast.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.840]   And wherever you are today,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.840]   enjoy that Butterfinger Blizzard to the glory of God.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.480]   Well, we are talking Bible reading today.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.360]   How do we turn our daily Bible reading into daily worship?
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.680]   Early in the new year is a very good time
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.600]   for a refresher on this topic of how to get truth
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.840]   from our heads into our hearts.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.080]   So we open up to Psalm 77.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.960]   Last Wednesday, we saw how the Psalm teaches us
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.000]   to push past personal discouragement
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080]   to get God's truth into our heads.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.120]   Asaph, its author, tells us to remember, to meditate,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.560]   and to muse upon the deeds and wonders of God in history.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.880]   Why?
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.600]   Because the central biblical strategy
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.160]   to escape the discouragements of life
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160]   is through a conscious effort of the mind.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.640]   That's what Pastor John said.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.760]   And even when life hurts the most,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.360]   we discipline ourselves to get truth into our minds.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.200]   And then once it's there in our heads,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.000]   we need to get that truth down into our hearts.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.680]   And today, Pastor John is gonna explain how he does that
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.920]   by illustrating the practice from his very own life
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.720]   in what I think is a pretty remarkable sermon clip
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   you're about to hear.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.400]   Again, taken from his New Year's sermon on Psalm 77,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.840]   preached back in the early moments of the year 2000.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.720]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.640]   - I know there are more obstacles to joy
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.400]   than absence of knowledge.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.080]   I know that there are physical obstacles.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.240]   I know that there are medical reasons.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.600]   I know that there are family reasons.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.760]   And I know that there are hereditary reasons.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.880]   In fact, Aaron shared with me a great essay
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.560]   or excerpt from a book by Richard Baxter,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.200]   who was a great soul doctor 300 years ago,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.760]   in which he was dealing with melancholy.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.160]   That's the old fashioned word for discouragement
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.600]   or in its worst cases, depression.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   And these old Puritans knew two things.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.240]   They knew their souls and they knew their Bibles.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.920]   The souls that they knew, they knew were connected to bodies
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.720]   and they knew these bodies were connected to,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.400]   they didn't know anything about genes,
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.080]   but they knew about moms and dads and granddads
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.920]   and great granddads.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.600]   And they knew the William Cowpers
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.920]   who tried to kill himself three times.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.280]   And they knew it was so of his parents
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.720]   and they knew it was so of his parents.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.120]   And it wasn't too hard to figure out,
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.960]   hmm, something going on here physically,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.440]   as well as family dynamics.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.800]   And therefore, the most amazing thing about this essay was,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.760]   he had practical guidelines for how to eat,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.600]   how to sleep, how to exercise, certain kinds of,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.520]   he said, for example, I shouldn't say this,
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.680]   I won't say it.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.520]   It's something about, something to do
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.760]   with the way you eat and the posture you're in
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.600]   when you eat.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.440]   Can you believe that?
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.840]   Puritans telling people how to sit while they eat
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.520]   in order to avoid melancholy, in order to avoid melancholy.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   So please don't hear me unfolding this strategy
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.960]   of the Christian life as oblivious to the fact
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.240]   these matters are more complex
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.600]   than simply knowledge in the head.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.400]   But here's my question for me mainly,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.280]   and I'll let you listen.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.880]   When I say I have it in my head,
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.000]   this Bible knowledge about God,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.560]   and it's not work, I'm feeling low still.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.160]   My question to me is, when you say,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.760]   I have my head filled with Bible doctrine
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.280]   or Bible knowledge, is that the same
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.840]   as what's being said here?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.760]   I will remember.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.360]   Surely I will remember the deeds of all.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   I will meditate and I will, surely I will muse.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.760]   And I have a feeling, have this little suspicion
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.920]   that American evangelicals are a very passive
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.160]   bunch of people when it comes to our emotions.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.040]   They come on us and we're passive.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.360]   And we've been taught to think somebody did this to me
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.160]   or I did it to myself, but it's happening to me.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.520]   And now, now what?
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.040]   Now what?
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   And there's this absence of the great old biblical
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.680]   Puritan awareness.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.200]   There's a strategy of life here.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.760]   There's a war to be fought here.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.040]   There's a delight to be struggled for here.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.760]   There's an intentionality and a purposefulness here.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.280]   And if you have just a little mustard seed left
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.880]   under the weight of the darkness to do something,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.040]   there are things that can be done here
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.640]   that might be blessed of God with.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.840]   Verse 13, so I don't think,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   and I'm just talking to myself still here, John Piper,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.360]   I don't think when you say, I know that about you, God,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.760]   and it's not helping me, I don't think that's meditation.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.400]   I don't think that's musing.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.440]   I think that's coasting.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.880]   So what is meditation?
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.480]   What is musing?
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.120]   This is something different than saying,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.040]   I've got lots of Bible knowledge in my head
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.000]   and it doesn't help.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.520]   That's very different than saying,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.600]   I will remember something that's in my head.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.360]   I'll pursue it, I'll dig around in there until I find it.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.200]   And then what do you do?
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.480]   Okay, I found it, I've got it.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.600]   Or maybe you have to dig in the Bible
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.680]   'cause your mind's just not working well enough to remember.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.080]   You go dig in there and you dig and you find it.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.240]   Then what do you do with it?
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.280]   Do you do anything with it?
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   What is meditation?
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.640]   What is musing?
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.520]   Well, let me just draw things to a close
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.240]   with an illustration.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.760]   I'll just do it out loud for you, okay?
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.960]   We'll do a little bit of this now.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.520]   You just watch me do it.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.840]   I will talk out loud what I would talk inside.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.320]   Suppose I come into year 2000
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.440]   and I'm feeling absolutely like a failure.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.080]   Last year was terrible.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.600]   I hardly ever read in the Bible.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.320]   I hardly ever prayed.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.240]   I mouthed off over and over again
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.760]   in the wrong circumstances.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.080]   Lust got all out of hand, blah, blah, blah.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.160]   It was one awful year.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.600]   And I frankly feel worthless and hopeless
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.320]   as I enter the year 2000.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.160]   So suppose that's where you are now.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.600]   And you hear a sermon like this.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.440]   You say, "Well, it didn't work.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.680]   "It didn't work last year.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.520]   "It doesn't work."
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.720]   I grew up in the church, for goodness sakes.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.840]   My head's stocked full of Bible knowledge
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.640]   about the Exodus.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.120]   Doesn't work.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.360]   All right, I will remember the deeds of the Lord.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.120]   I remember a day 2000 years ago
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.120]   when on a Roman cross of execution
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.720]   there was the greatest, most loving, most kind,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.040]   most gentle, most wise, sinless man
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.520]   that ever was hanging on the cross.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.040]   I will call this to mind.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.280]   And he is suffering greatly.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.880]   His head is thorned and his face is beat up.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.920]   His beard is plucked out.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.760]   His back is lacerated.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.240]   Nails are through his hands and his feet.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.200]   He can barely breathe.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.880]   He has screamed himself hoarse
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.120]   and can no longer scream and is on the brink of death.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.880]   And next to him on either side is a thief.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.200]   They have both railed at him, cursed him.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.760]   Get yourself and us down if you're some big shot Messiah.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.800]   And then I will call to mind
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.200]   that one of those thieves suddenly,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   inexplicably, awesomely looks over at this Christ and says,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.880]   "Remember me when you come into your kingdom."
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   And I will call to mind where'd that come from?
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.560]   He was cursing the Lord.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.360]   He was making fun of this bleeding Messiah.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.080]   Where did that come from?
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.280]   And I will remember the work of grace,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.320]   the work of sovereign grace in the 11th hour.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.480]   Here's a man who did nothing but wrong all his life,
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.680]   never had one act of obedience of faith,
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.120]   deserves hell and is about 20 minutes away from hell.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.600]   And he presumes to say, "Remember me."
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.440]   Remember you?
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.680]   I'll remember you, I'll send you straight to hell, right?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.160]   That's what I do with people like you,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.480]   thieves all their life long.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.440]   I will meditate on the mighty deeds of Christ
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.640]   who looked over the nail on his right hand and said,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.040]   and the plaintiffs didn't stop to move
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.680]   or stop moving for some reason,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.280]   "Today, you will be with me in paradise."
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   And I will not leave that and go off to my pity party
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.320]   and say, "It doesn't work.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.840]   "I've got that knowledge in my head
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.280]   "and it doesn't change anything."
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.560]   I will linger with that sentence.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.080]   I will stay with that sentence.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.840]   I will take hold of that sentence
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.920]   and not let it go until it blesses me.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.880]   And it doesn't have to be long with that sentence
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.120]   for me anyway.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.360]   Today, you thief in the 11th hour
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.080]   with nothing to commend yourself to God whatsoever,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.360]   you don't even have time to get out and obey
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.200]   and show yourself that you're real.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.840]   You're gonna go straight with me to paradise.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.360]   What kind of grace is that that I might be a part of?
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   - That is an amazing Christ-centered,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.760]   cross-centered sermon clip taken from a message preached
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.760]   on January 2nd, 2000 on Psalm 77,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.560]   titled "I Will Meditate on All Your Work
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.520]   "and Muse on Your Deeds."
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.360]   That's the title.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.760]   The full message is in the sermon archive
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.840]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.960]   A fitting word for us in these early days of 2023.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.880]   Thank you for joining us
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.360]   as we begin our second decade of APJ.

[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.680]   Well, Asaph is the author of Psalm 77
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.640]   and he was so deeply despondent
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.840]   that he could not even sleep.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.160]   He says that in Psalm 77, verse four.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.320]   There are physical dimensions to despondency
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.600]   and we are gonna look at those next time.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.240]   We'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
