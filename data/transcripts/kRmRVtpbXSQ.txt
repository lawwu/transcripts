[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Intro]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Alyssa writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I grew up in a wonderful Christian home where
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.480]   the gospel was lived out before me every day and I trusted Christ as my Savior in my youth.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.640]   However, around the age of 14, I began to wrestle with many questions about the Christian
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.920]   faith.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.800]   Over the seven years since, I have spent countless hours studying the Christian worldview and
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.440]   apologetics as well as other worldviews.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.200]   I see no lack of evidence for the Christian faith, but my mind always comes up with more
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.320]   questions that don't seem to have satisfactory answers in order for me to feel honest about
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.760]   believing the things in God's Word.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   At the end of the day, I don't understand how I can ever know any truth for sure since
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.320]   I will never be able to collect all the facts about anything.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.840]   How can we as finite humans be certain that we have found the truth when we are limited
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.840]   by our own humanity?"
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.720]   That is so good.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:03.720]   The issues of knowing and certainty and assurance are so, so relevant.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.160]   Everybody, everybody deals with these things at some point.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.280]   So as I understand it, here's the key, final, decisive question.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:23.040]   How can we as finite humans be certain that we have found the truth when we are limited
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.720]   in our own humanity?
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.040]   We're finite, but we want certainty, and they don't seem to go together.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.400]   So before I answer the question, which I will, I'll give an answer that I think is biblical.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.060]   Let me put some biblical truth in front of us here.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:51.920]   The first is to be sure that we're aware God really does want us to have full assurance
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.600]   of his reality and the truth of the gospel.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.680]   Full assurance, certainty, deep, strong, unshakable conviction.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.480]   He did not design a world where that's impossible for fallen, finite people.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.120]   First John 5, "I write these things to you who believe in the Son of God, that you may
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.880]   know that you have eternal life."
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.840]   John 7, 17, "If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.000]   from God."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.680]   Hebrews 6, 11, "We desire each of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.880]   of hope to the end."
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.120]   Colossians 2, 2, "I struggle for them that their hearts may be encouraged to reach the
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.840]   riches of full assurance of understanding."
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.200]   And Romans 1, 20, "God's invisible attributes have been clearly perceived ever since the
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.920]   creation of the world in the things that have been made, so they are without excuse, for
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.060]   although they knew God, they knew God, they did not honor him as God."
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.900]   So God did not design the world and the way of salvation and the process of revelation
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.480]   and the nature of the Bible and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.640]   He didn't design any of those so that we would only have good probability judgments about
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   the truth.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.880]   He did not intend for us to cross our fingers.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.560]   I saw a woman sitting in the final of the World Cup.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.120]   They showed, I think, a woman from Argentina, and she just had her fingers crossed in the
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   last minutes.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   I thought, "That's not the way we approach the final judgment.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   Our fingers crossed.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.040]   Oh, I wonder if I'm going to make it at the last day."
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.400]   That's a tragedy if Christians have to die with their fingers crossed.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.740]   He didn't intend us to leap into the dark either.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.640]   So Elissa is right in asking the question, "How?"
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.720]   That's the right question, "How?"
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:07.220]   Not "if," but "How can we as finite humans be certain that we found the truth?"
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.640]   And the answer, I think, comes at two levels.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:23.440]   Warranted certainty of another person's trustworthiness is more than the sum of the empirical evidences
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   that he is trustworthy.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.280]   I know that's a little bit of a complicated sentence.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.360]   I mean, warranted certainty is more than adding up one, two, three, four, five, I've got six
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.440]   evidences that he's trustworthy, now I can be certain.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.520]   That never works.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.360]   It never works because you can always ask another question, right?
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.800]   I trust my wife that she is faithful to me.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.640]   I could get evidences from experience, lots of them, but in the end, there would always
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.040]   be a niggling doubt, wouldn't there, if it were just the list of evidences because she
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   could be tricking me somehow.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.280]   Just like Elissa says about her own knowledge of God, she studies, she asks questions, she
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   gets answers, and there always seems to be another question because she's finite and
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.140]   I'm fallible about Noelle.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:21.160]   So in fact, I have zero doubt that Noelle is faithful to me.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   She is.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   I never lose a moment's sleep over it.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:35.120]   So experientially, I have a working certainty, and it's more than the sum of the parts.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.240]   It's a personal assurance that comes from a personal encounter.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.440]   Knowing her creates something which is in, yes, the evidences, and then goes subjectively
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.720]   beyond the evidences.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.800]   I think we can have that kind of knowledge, that kind of personal knowledge of Jesus by
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.080]   our exposure to his self-revelation in the Bible.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:08.400]   The more you get to know him, the more sure you are that he is reliable.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Here's the other level.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:20.440]   God does not give us certainty by whispering in our ear that we are true or he's true,
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.920]   but he does give us certainty.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.320]   It is a gift of God.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:35.760]   He does it by opening our eyes, the eyes of our hearts, to see the real self-evidencing
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.840]   glory of God in the gospel.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.000]   And I get that partly from Ephesians 1, mainly from 2 Corinthians 4, which goes like this.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.560]   The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.760]   light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:05.640]   In verse 6, "For God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' has shown in our hearts
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:12.920]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   So in both cases, light is imparted by God.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.560]   It's the light of gospel or the light of knowledge, and more specifically, it is the knowledge
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.840]   of glory or the gospel of glory.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:33.320]   So there is a revelation of the glory of God, the glory of Christ, in the gospel, in the
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:40.720]   knowledge of the historical revelation given in the Bible that is self-authenticating.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.760]   There is a divine and supernatural light.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.280]   That's the phrase of Jonathan Edwards.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.920]   A divine and supernatural light imparted to the soul by the work of God, which is a real
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   seeing.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's a real seeing.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   That's really crucial.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.640]   It's not irrational.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.800]   It's a real seeing of what's really there.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.680]   It's not a guess or a mere deduction by fallible logic.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:13.360]   It is a gift of God through the ordinary means of knowing the gospel.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.080]   And we should pray for this.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:23.280]   So that would be my closing exhortation, is that we would pray, Elissa would pray, "Open
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.000]   my eyes to see this wonderful, self-authenticating light of glory in your Word."
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yes.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.880]   Thank you for the question.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.680]   On a related note, you may want to check out episode number 226, which is titled, "How
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.840]   Do You Know Christianity is True?"
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   And if you want to ask a question, please send it to us via email at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.880]   Well tomorrow is Friday, and we end the week with a doozy of a question.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.200]   If Christ has triumphed over Satan and over every power and principality, why wasn't Satan
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.440]   just eliminated from existence?
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.840]   I'll ask Pastor John that tomorrow.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.600]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.100]   [END]
