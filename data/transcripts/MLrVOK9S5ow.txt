[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780]   our 23rd meeting of Intermediate Biblical Counseling.
[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.780]   Trust that you're doing well and trust
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.580]   that your Thanksgiving break was a happy one.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.440]   It's great to have you back on this class.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.140]   As you know, we're moving our way to the end of this class
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.620]   and this year and heading to our final two meetings of 2020.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.020]   We'll be looking at tonight Theology exam number 23,
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.860]   and then next Sunday,
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.300]   we'll be looking at Theology exam number 24.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.900]   We will get through the Theology exams by the end of this year,
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.660]   and then we'll wait until January to do the counseling exams.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.380]   But I do hope that your study has been a blessed one,
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.660]   and that you've been encouraged as you've been looking at
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.580]   these wonderful topics from the ACBC Theology exams,
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.140]   and just encouraged by your faithfulness and your love for God's word.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.380]   Thank you for being with us this year and for continuing in our study together.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.780]   Well, tonight we are looking at Theology exam number 23,
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.660]   and we're looking at the doctrine of the church.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.580]   If you remember from your last two Theology exams,
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.100]   we left off studying the doctrine of the Holy Spirit
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.460]   in the last two weeks of our class together,
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.340]   and now we are making a transition from the doctrine of
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.860]   the Holy Spirit to the doctrine of the church in theological terms.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.020]   We're moving from pneumatology to ecclesiology,
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.300]   and that transition shouldn't be a difficult one to make.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.380]   If you understand that we as believers have been baptized into the Holy Spirit of God,
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.420]   that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.020]   and that we have been given the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.580]   then it's a natural transition to look at who we are corporately as a church,
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.780]   that the church is the new spiritual organism in
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.620]   the New Testament age that has been birthed by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.740]   and that proclaims the gospel to the world
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.380]   in the power and in the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.980]   We are transitioning from pneumatology to ecclesiology,
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.940]   from the doctrine of the Holy Spirit to the doctrine of the church,
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.260]   and I can't think of any better way to spend an hour
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.460]   tonight than in talking through the doctrine of the church.
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.420]   This is a doctrine that I love.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.300]   This is a doctrine that I trust you will love.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.980]   This is a doctrine that is near and dear to the heart
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.460]   of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors, ACBC.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:02.180]   In fact, this is probably one of the distinctives of ACBC that I love and that I treasure,
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.820]   is the fact that not only does ACBC hold to the doctrine of
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.580]   sufficiency as it relates to Scripture's role in counseling,
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.860]   but also holds to a view of the local church that sees
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.740]   counseling as an expression of the church's ministry.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.400]   This is a distinctive.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.260]   Most counseling organizations see counseling as
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.700]   an activity that happens outside of the local church and not inside of the local church.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.980]   What you'll see in most counseling approaches in our world today is
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.700]   that people are promoting an idea that in order to do effective counseling,
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.760]   we need to refer people outside of the local church,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.640]   and it's when they go outside the church,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.620]   that is when they're going to get the most help for their problems.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.740]   As you know, ACBC holds to a high view of the local church
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.220]   that sees counseling as a ministry of the church,
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.700]   that the most effective help that people are going to
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.580]   get for their problems happens inside the church,
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.700]   and so the church ought to embrace
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.740]   the ministry of counseling as part of the ministry of the church.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.820]   ACBC promotes that view of counseling.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.060]   ACBC has a high view of the local church.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.060]   In fact, you cannot get certified as a biblical counselor with
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.260]   ACBC without being a member of a local church,
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.460]   without having a recommendation and affirmation of
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.100]   your counseling ministry from the pastors and the elders of your local church.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.500]   In fact, ACBC is so intent on getting the affirmation of
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.340]   the local church that they require a yearly annual reaffirmation of a counselor's ministry,
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.540]   and so I need to as a pastor in my local church,
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.860]   sign off on the counselors in our church and their ministry on an annual basis,
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.340]   because we do see that people want to become
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.580]   counselors and they actually do become certified counselors,
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.260]   and then they may leave their local church and be operating
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.540]   outside of the authority of the local church,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.500]   and so ACBC, if they see that happen,
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.140]   that person will not be renewed in their certification.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.420]   All that to say that we take that very seriously.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.900]   We take the local church's role in counseling very seriously,
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.020]   and what you have in ACBC is an organization that is very devoted
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.660]   to holding a high view of the local church in counseling ministry.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.540]   So I do hope that's something you'll embrace.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.620]   I hope that as I stated in year one of our training,
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.580]   that you as a counselor will be committed to your church,
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.540]   that you will have a reputation in your local church to
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.220]   uphold the ministry of the pastors and the elders of the church,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.060]   that you will become known in your church,
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.540]   that you will serve in your church.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.620]   One of the questions that ACBC has us write out for our counselors is on an annual basis,
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:43.060]   is does this person uphold the elders and the pastors of the local church?
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.140]   Are they submissive and supportive of the leadership of the local church?
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.460]   So I always tell my counselors,
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.940]   you guys better be nice to me throughout the year because the annual review is coming,
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:03.780]   and they are more than exemplary in supporting the leaders of their local church.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.300]   But I hope it's something you'll embrace,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.900]   that you will be known for this,
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.820]   that you will be church people,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.300]   that you will be known not only for your love for Christ and his word,
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.140]   but also for your commitment to your church.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.380]   So with that preamble,
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.740]   let me get into our study for tonight,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.020]   and I do pray that each of you will be encouraged.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.500]   I do thank God for each of you.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.460]   Thank you so much for your encouragement as we've worked our way through this year,
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.980]   and just to know that you're showing up every Sunday,
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.380]   desiring to be equipped for counseling ministry.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:47.300]   There is no greater joy than to see people love the word of God,
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.220]   and desire to learn the word of God,
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:58.020]   and just encouraged by each of you joining us on this webinar for this class.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.300]   So let me pray for us, and let's dive right in.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:08.580]   Well, Heavenly Father, thank you so much for the privilege of studying your word,
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:15.100]   and we thank you so much for the privilege of not only belonging to Christ,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.660]   but the privilege of belonging to the local church.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.340]   We thank you for the church,
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.620]   for this is the church which Christ has purchased with his own blood,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:35.180]   and we thank you that the church is the very body and the bride of Christ,
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.580]   and that your word teaches us to love Christ is to love the church,
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.780]   and to love the church is to love Christ,
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:48.820]   for the church lives in vital spiritual union with Christ.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:57.180]   And so we just thank you for how the local church is a means of blessing to each of our lives.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.860]   We thank you for the gatherings of the church.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.180]   We thank you for the songs of the church.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:10.500]   We thank you for the ordinances of the church, baptism and the Lord's Supper.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:16.780]   We thank you for the fellowship of the church, for the teaching ministry of the church.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:23.460]   We thank you that the church is the environment in which we grow spiritually,
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:32.460]   and that it is the most precious institution on the earth today.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.780]   We thank you that Christ has promised to build his church.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:45.980]   And so Father, we pray that you would help us in these last two weeks to develop a robust ecclesiology,
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.700]   that we would understand what your word teaches about the church,
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:10:00.620]   and that we would see counseling ministry as an extension and as an expression of the local church's ministry.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.980]   And may many come to our churches and receive help and hope from your word,
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:12.900]   and be ministered to by the body of Christ, and have lives that are changed for your glory,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.540]   we pray as a result of our study together.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.540]   We pray your spirit would work in us tonight, and we pray this in Jesus name. Amen.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.700]   Amen. Well, let's read the theology exam question together.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.940]   We were looking at the doctrine of the church in theology exam number 23.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.260]   The question is provide a biblical description of the church.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:51.220]   Now that, as you note, will be a very general prompt for an essay dealing with what is the church and what does the Bible say about the church?
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:59.140]   Just note that in theology exam number 24, you're going to get more specific about how counseling ministry relates to the church.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.500]   This week's exam question really is a general prompt.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:14.740]   It's a general question asking you to describe just the general descriptions of what the Bible says about the church.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:21.900]   And I do pray that you will write a good essay on this topic.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:30.180]   A number of helpful resources on page one of your handout, you have the usual selections from the standard resources.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:38.500]   We have Wayne Grudem, Systematic Theology, Paul Enns, The Moody Handbook of Theology, Charles Ryrie, Basic Theology,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.460]   and then Heath Lamberts, A Theology of Biblical Counseling.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:52.700]   I would also recommend to you a selection from the Journal of Biblical Counseling, David Powelson's Counseling is the Church.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:58.260]   I believe that can be purchased from the CCEF website.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:07.220]   Just a really good resource thinking through how counseling relates to the local church.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:16.420]   And then a really good resource that you want to have on your bookshelf is Robert Soce's The Church in God's Program.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:23.900]   Now, if I had one book that I would recommend to put in a person's hands to give them a solid,
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:33.260]   comprehensive overview of what the Bible teaches about the church, it would be Robert Soce's The Church in God's Program.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:40.300]   You'll find that much of my material is at least inspired by or prompted by Soce's study,
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:46.140]   especially his summary of the biblical illustrations of the church.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.740]   And so if you want a resource that you can easily footnote in your essays,
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:59.740]   you can pick up Robert Soce's work and you can take your quotations from his material.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:06.860]   I do encourage people not to quote from my lecture notes because my lecture notes are not published material.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:13.260]   But you'll find that if you want to quote from a good published resource,
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:21.980]   Robert Soce's The Church in God's Program is a helpful and very readable study as well.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.820]   So I highly recommend you to have that on your bookshelf.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:36.820]   Let's move in our study to page two of your notes, and we're looking at the topic of the doctrine of the church.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:42.340]   If you get a chance, take a look at the ACBC Standards of Doctrine.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:48.660]   Those can be found at the ACBC website at biblicalcounseling.com.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:54.380]   By the way, ACBC has a brand new website that has been launched.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.060]   You can find that at biblicalcounseling.com.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:04.740]   It's a beautiful website and very well done by the folks at ACBC.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:10.740]   But on the ACBC Standards of Doctrine, we have a section on the doctrine of the church,
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:18.260]   and it states that the church is the bride of Christ called to proclaim the word of God,
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:24.980]   administer baptism and the Lord's Supper, and exercise church discipline.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:30.860]   The church is the organism through which God accomplishes his mission in the world.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:41.900]   It is the main agent for all ministry of the word, including the ministry of counseling and discipleship.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.260]   And again, if you want a resource that is easily quotable for your essays,
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:54.020]   you can never go wrong by quoting from the ACBC Standards of Doctrine.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:15:02.820]   That is a very good statement that summarizes what the Bible teaches about the church.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:11.380]   Just on a devotional, practical, personal note, we want to be reminded that as believers,
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.980]   we are meant to live with a passion for the local church.
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:23.340]   God has called us to love the church and not only to love the universal church,
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:29.380]   the worldwide body of Christ, but to love our local church,
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:35.180]   which is an expression of the worldwide body of Christ.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:41.580]   If I wanted to say I want to esteem and love the institution of marriage,
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:47.500]   I want to esteem the marital covenant in general and uphold the institution of marriage,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:54.700]   then one of the best ways I can do that is by loving my wife and being faithful in my own marriage.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:00.220]   And in a similar way, we can express our love for the universal church,
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.300]   the worldwide body of Christ, by loving our local church,
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:17.740]   the particular local expression of the body of Christ, which is found in every nation and in every continent.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.540]   A helpful distinction between these two ideas, you have the universal church,
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:31.340]   which is the theological term we use to describe the church worldwide.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:38.060]   Henry Thiessen defines this as all those who in this age have been born of the spirit of God
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:45.180]   and have by that same spirit been baptized into the body of Christ.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:53.700]   So when we refer to the universal church, we're speaking of the worldwide body of Christ.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:59.420]   And just I do encourage you to have a passion for the church universal,
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:06.380]   to have a passion for the church in Australia, the church in Japan, the church in Italy,
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.140]   the church in Russia, the worldwide body of Christ.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.740]   There ought to be a global passion that we have for the church,
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:22.220]   that as we see the church built up in any nation and in every nation,
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:29.220]   that we would rejoice and that we would be in prayer for the universal church.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:37.740]   But what a joy it is to know that the universal church has particular local expressions.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:46.900]   The local church is defined as a group of believers that is identified as a local assembly or congregation.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:54.580]   That would be the definition by Paul Enns in the Moody Handbook of Theology.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:18:03.700]   We express our esteem for the universal church by being faithful in our local church.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.460]   Now, if you've been committed to your local church for any length of time,
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:14.620]   you know that being committed to the local church is not always glamorous.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:21.460]   Being committed to a local church means that we show up every Sunday to the same church
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.100]   and we see the same people, we hear preaching from the same pastor,
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.380]   and we do that Sunday after Sunday, year after year,
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.820]   and we just desire to be faithful to those things.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.300]   It's not so much a glamorous commitment,
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.300]   and all church people will be able to tell you the same.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.180]   It's serving in the nursery,
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.580]   it's serving refreshments to the saints,
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.140]   it's opening the same Bible,
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.980]   sitting in the same seat many times,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:19:01.540]   if you're in a routine of sitting in the same location in your particular assembly,
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.580]   and it's just doing that week after week,
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.580]   Sunday after Sunday, year after year,
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.540]   just being faithful to your local church,
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:15.700]   and yet it is through this commitment of being faithful to my local church
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:23.020]   that we express our love and our esteem for the church universal.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:29.420]   We are part of what God is doing in building up his church worldwide
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:36.940]   as we show up in our local congregations day after day and week after week.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.260]   By committing ourselves to some very small things,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.780]   we become part of the great and the glorious work of God
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.540]   that he is doing in building his church around the world.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.260]   You see that scripture refers to the universal church in Ephesians 5,
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.980]   verse 25, where Paul says,
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:05.140]   "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.340]   That's referring to the church universal.
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.060]   All those who have been born by the Spirit of God,
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.380]   Christ loved the church.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.940]   But then you'll find in other passages,
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.060]   references to the local church.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.820]   For instance, in Acts 8, verse 1,
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:33.100]   "There arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem."
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.820]   That's referring to the particular expression of
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:42.180]   the universal church in the particular city of Jerusalem.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.580]   You'll find that throughout the New Testament scriptures.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.620]   Scripture refers to the church in 1 Corinthians 1, verse 2.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:57.180]   The churches of Galatia in Galatians 1, verse 2.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:02.100]   The church of the Thessalonians in 1 Thessalonians 1, verse 1.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:09.980]   You have these local expressions of a worldwide or universal reality.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.260]   This concept of universal church and local church is
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.580]   found in the New Testament scriptures.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.340]   By the way, when you're looking at
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.980]   those two concepts of universal church versus local church,
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.620]   it may surprise you to see how much Scripture
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.860]   emphasizes the second aspect, the local church.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.580]   In fact, I think this is in your notes,
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:44.300]   the term ecclesia is the common New Testament word referring to the church.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.380]   Out of 114 occurrences in the New Testament,
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.140]   at least 90 times it refers to the local church.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:22:02.740]   There is a high priority in Scripture that is placed upon a commitment to a local church.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.860]   Now, in our day, we find that the priority of
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.180]   the local church really is being diminished and I don't mean to be critical here,
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.140]   but I do want to be true to life.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.620]   We do see a lot of church hopping in people's lives.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.940]   People do float from church to church or they're around
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.180]   one church long enough to see its flaws and then they move to another church.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:35.540]   We just do see a lot of a low commitment to a particular local church.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.620]   I always tell a humorous example of one person goes
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.260]   to one church because they like the worship team there,
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.580]   and then they go to another church because they like the preaching there.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.900]   They go to a third church because they like the donuts
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.260]   there and they're moving from church to church.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.820]   That's a little bit of an exaggeration,
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.940]   but not so much of an exaggeration.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:08.100]   We do see that people tend to have a low view of a steady commitment to the local church.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.020]   We do find on a very practical note that many of the people that we
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:18.700]   counsel have problems in their lives because they
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:25.180]   have no regular faithful involvement with a local church.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.700]   Either they haven't become members of a church or maybe they are members,
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:35.980]   but they're not engaged on a weekly basis in the ministry of the church.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.180]   They don't have relationships in their church.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.580]   They're not part of a small group.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.460]   No one's praying for them.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.020]   They're not praying for anyone.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.980]   There isn't this mutual one-anothering that is part of the body life that's happening in
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:56.020]   their lives and we do find that many of our counselees are really struggling with
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.420]   a lot of spiritual baggage,
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.020]   a lot of spiritual struggles because they don't have
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.420]   a robust commitment to their local church and part of
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:12.060]   counseling ministry is helping our counselees see their need for involvement in
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.820]   a local church and helping them to take those next steps
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:20.940]   to become faithful participants of the local church.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.300]   But there is a heavy emphasis in scripture on the local church.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.140]   Dr. Larry Pettigrew writes this,
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:33.940]   that the local church is intended to be a local reflection of the body of Christ.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.420]   The local is simply the active,
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.700]   working, visible counterpart of the universal.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:49.620]   A very good way of relating the two concepts of universal church and local church.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.900]   Earl Rodmacher has put it this way in his book,
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.820]   The Nature of the Church.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.940]   He writes that the working method of God in the world at any given time is to carry out
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.340]   his purpose through the members of the body of Christ,
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.460]   who are living in the world at that time.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.060]   The New Testament always views these members of the body as
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.220]   banded together in groups known as local churches.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.660]   Thus, the church is in the world in the form of local churches,
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.220]   which are physical organizations with
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.900]   physical relationships and definite physical responsibilities.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.460]   I love this statement. The local church is God's agency in the world,
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.860]   transacting God's business.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:44.340]   Now, just think through the implications of that statement.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.420]   I think John MacArthur has put it this way,
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.820]   that God is really only doing one thing in the world today,
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.460]   and that is he is building Christ Church.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.020]   Everything else going on in the world is just background and backdrop to
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:07.620]   the great story of how Christ is building his church in the New Testament era,
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.580]   and the church will be presented to Christ at the marriage supper of the Lamb,
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.100]   without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:22.020]   The very bride of Christ that will one day be glorified.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.060]   God is doing only really one thing in the world today,
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.420]   and he is building his church,
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:33.940]   and everything else just provides the environment or the context in which that is happening.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.020]   The local church is God's agency in the world,
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.580]   transacting God's business.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.100]   So I tell young people this,
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.820]   I say if you want to be something big,
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.500]   give your heart and your life to the church.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.340]   This is where it's at.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.220]   This is where the action is happening.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.140]   This is where God is changing lives.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.500]   This is where God is doing his business in the world.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.660]   It's not in the government.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.620]   It's not in the corporations.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.100]   I mean, all of that is good and well,
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.500]   and all of that has its place,
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.060]   but all of that is just backdrop and
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.060]   background to what God is doing in building his church.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:19.700]   If you want to be in the middle of the greatest work that God is doing in the world today,
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.500]   then give your heart and your life to your local church.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.140]   Be there. Be there when the church meets.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.900]   Be there when the word is taught.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.980]   Be there when relationships are formed,
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.740]   when the church prays together.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.500]   Be committed to your local church,
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.380]   and I'll tell you on the backside of some of you know,
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.660]   I have young adult children,
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:49.140]   and my wife and I have always sought to instill in our children,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.980]   the priority of the local church.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.700]   There were always things that they weren't able to do,
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.820]   because we always said that we're going to be there when the church meets,
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.740]   that our children are going to be there when the church meets,
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.020]   and if that means they can't go to a soccer game,
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.620]   or they can't be part of another extracurricular activity,
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.500]   then that was going to be the price that we were going to pay,
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.300]   and I'll tell you on the end of that journey,
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.620]   or the beginning of the end of that journey is,
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:23.140]   we have no regrets that our children were not always able to do
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:28.980]   all of the things that all children do or the society tells you that they need to do,
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.540]   but they have grown up with a love for the local church,
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:39.220]   and we have no regrets in making that a priority.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.780]   The church is where it's at,
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.900]   and so Wayne Mack has put it this way in his excellent work,
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.340]   Life in the Father's House.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.020]   He says, at the primary context,
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.660]   and by the way, you need to have that book,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.620]   Life in the Father's House by Wayne Mack at my previous church.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:03.460]   We used to make that book required reading for anyone who wants to become a church member,
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.020]   because it was just so helpful in thinking through what is the church,
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.420]   and what does it mean to be part of the local church,
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.220]   and Wayne Mack writes this,
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:19.500]   the primary context in which God wants this involvement to take place is the local body of believers,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.980]   and so the commitment called for is also a commitment to the church.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.900]   Almost all of the one another's of the New Testament are given directly to
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:36.940]   local churches and are intended to help those churches be what God wants them to be.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:43.620]   It is not enough for us to say that we are merely a part of the universal or invisible church.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:51.380]   We must also commit ourselves to a local or visible group of God's people.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:57.060]   That's a great statement and worthy of our careful attention.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.860]   So let me move to the next page of your handout,
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:07.180]   and let me make a point here that maybe at the risk of restating the obvious,
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:13.460]   but that's okay because I think we need to at times restate the obvious.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.980]   The statement is this,
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:20.340]   that Christians are meant to have a definite relationship to
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:29.620]   a defined local church with a definite structure under a definitive authority.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.820]   I'll just repeat that again.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.060]   Christians are meant to have a definite relationship,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.100]   that's church membership, to a defined local church,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:46.140]   that's a particular local assembly with a definite structure,
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:53.620]   that's an organized local assembly of believers under a definitive authority,
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.460]   that's a plurality of elders.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.700]   We could go through each of those components,
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.780]   but just as a brief summary,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.980]   I would highlight two points here that the definite relationship that we're
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:13.040]   talking about really can be defined as church membership.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.900]   Every church does membership a little bit differently,
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:22.020]   but the concept of church membership is thoroughly biblical.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.260]   I've taught church membership classes here at
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.940]   Kinder Community Church over the last five years and people have asked me,
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:34.660]   "Well, Dan, where does it say that I need to become a church member in the Bible?
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.940]   Where is church membership found in the Bible?"
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.040]   I've always responded to that by saying,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.340]   "Where is the concept of a believer being able to
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.900]   grow without a definite relationship to the local church?
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.020]   Where is that concept found in the Bible that you just have
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.780]   individual believers doing whatever they please and not gathering in
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:01.500]   local assemblies and being accountable and known in that assembly?"
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.740]   The concept of church membership is thoroughly biblical.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.560]   The concept of a believer being placed in a local assembly,
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.280]   being accountable to that assembly,
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.780]   being submissive to the elders and the pastors of that assembly,
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.920]   being governed by a particular church governance structure,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.840]   being into the one another life of that local church and
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:32.520]   partaking of the ordinances that are given by that church.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.840]   That concept is thoroughly biblical that a believer is known in that local assembly,
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.920]   that there is a definite relationship that each believer needs to
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:48.080]   have with a particular local church.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:56.240]   So that is just something that we need to promote and that we need to be a part of,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:02.840]   is this idea of having a known public relationship that says,
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.760]   in church membership, that's what it is.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.280]   It's a public relationship where you publicly identify yourself as
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:15.040]   being accountable to a particular local assembly to the point that if you were,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:23.640]   God forbid, ever to go astray in doctrine or in terms of your personal holiness,
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.240]   if you're ever to go astray and fall into sin,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.800]   that there would be a particular local assembly that would have
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.080]   the right and the responsibility of shepherding you,
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.440]   disciplining you, and bringing you back,
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.760]   restoring you back into the fellowship.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.320]   That is talking about a definite relationship.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.120]   Then another point here I would highlight is that
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.600]   this local assembly is governed under definitive authority.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.760]   I believe Titus 1 and 1 Timothy 3,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.920]   as well as 1 Timothy 5,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.800]   would call for a plurality of elders which govern
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.440]   a local assembly that shepherd the local church
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.880]   and that are responsible to give an account for that church.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.800]   So as an elder of my church,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:22.640]   I live under the burden and I mean that as a joyful burden,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.160]   but it is a burden too that one day I will give
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.600]   an account for the sheep who are members of my church.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.280]   Hebrews 13 is very clear that one day elders will give
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.240]   an account for the members in their church.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.280]   That is a joy and it's a glad burden,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.240]   but I live under that responsibility that I will give an account.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   I need to know where the sheep are.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.760]   I need to know who's going astray.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.280]   I need to know who's struggling,
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.680]   who needs prayer, who's in the hospital.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.480]   I need to know those things because that is
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.120]   the responsibility of an elder in the church.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.640]   Now, I cannot know or give an account for
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:13.480]   sheep if they have never identified themselves as belonging to my church.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.520]   I cannot account for their spiritual life if they have
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.520]   never even identified themselves and let us know what their names are.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.280]   I say to the members of my church,
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.280]   please make my life easier on the day when I will give
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.520]   an account to the Lord by being easy to give an account for.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.280]   Make it easy for your elders to give an account for your soul.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.200]   Be there on Sunday, be there in classes,
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.320]   be there in small groups so that we know where you are,
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.760]   we know how you're doing,
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.320]   make it easy for us,
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.720]   and church membership is part of that process.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.280]   Christians are meant to live in this way.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.040]   It's very important that we understand that.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.320]   Now, because I do belong to a local church,
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.760]   I'm going to brag on the pastor of my church,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   Pastor Philip DeCourcy,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:11.440]   who was on a discussion panel with some leading national counseling figures,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:18.680]   and these leading national figures held to an integrationist view of counseling.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.480]   If I told you who they were,
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.680]   you would know who they are because they're nationally known.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.800]   What these leaders were essentially saying is that
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.920]   the church doesn't have the resources to counsel their members,
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:42.280]   and what the church needs to do is to refer their members out to "professional counselors"
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:48.880]   in order to receive real help for their problems.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.840]   Those of us who know Pastor Philip,
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.720]   we could see his body language on this Q&A panel.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:04.640]   We could see that he had a little righteous indignation at what the people were saying.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:11.320]   I love so much what Pastor Philip said that I transcribed that and put that on your handout,
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.240]   and I won't be able to recreate the Irish accent,
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.360]   but he said this on the panel,
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.840]   "I just get a little unsettled when we use the term 'professional counselor'
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   because every one of my pastors are professional, competent, capable, theological, and godly.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.040]   I just get a little disturbed when we use this term as if you could go to
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:40.240]   your pastor who is not a professional and then you could go to the professional counselor.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.520]   When I talk about being with my elders,
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.000]   these men are counselors.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.480]   They've got years of walking with Christ.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   They've seen life in the raw.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.360]   They can handle the word of God.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.080]   I'm not ruling out going to a doctor or a psychiatrist in some cases,
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.240]   but today in the church,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.440]   we have so elevated psychiatry side of the fence,
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.000]   and the professional medical side of things,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.400]   it demotes the pastor."
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.960]   The Puritans called pastors physicians of the soul.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.040]   Just historically, pastors were the counselors in the congregations,
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.240]   the physicians of the soul.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.440]   While the doctor has a role to play in the physical side,
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.880]   if a man knows the word,
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.960]   he can address the issue of anger,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.840]   eating habits, because that's an issue of self-control.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.200]   He can make that a gospel issue.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.680]   I want my people to know that the first port of call is the church.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.400]   The first port of call is your pastors who can handle God's word.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:43.000]   Then a wise pastor won't rule out in the common grace of God and in the providence of God.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.720]   That person might need something,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.760]   but I just think we tend to run to that too quickly.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.600]   At our church, we train our people to counsel from the word of
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.120]   God so that we address those issues that families are going through.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.640]   At this point in the dialogue,
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.760]   one of the leading integrationist counselors said something to the effect of,
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.040]   "You don't really mean to say that the church has the ability to help
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.800]   someone with a cutting issue or an eating problem, an eating disorder."
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.440]   Pastor Philip responded, "I feel
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.520]   any pastor should feel qualified to address the cutting issue.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.400]   At the end of the day, that's an image problem.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.200]   It's a self-control problem.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.760]   It's a body image problem,
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   and that's a biblical issue.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.360]   You take a young girl to Psalm 139,
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.520]   you take a young guy,
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.040]   you say your identity is in Christ and you work theologically and biblically at that.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.280]   I think those are theological issues.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.360]   The New Testament addressed,
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.880]   I would assume, all issues, all sins.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.640]   There's nothing new under the sun,
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.760]   and it seems they didn't have this third group.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.440]   It was pastors, it was God's people taking the word of God,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.200]   which is sufficient to equip us onto every good work.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.560]   Now, we in the office,
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.320]   we were listening to this Q&A live,
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.680]   and then we all started high-fiving each other and
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.280]   texting each other because we were so pumped by what Pastor Philip has said,
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.160]   and I think he lost some friends probably as he made this statement,
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.920]   but he also gained the loyalty of many who are loyal to scripture.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:28.960]   The point is this, that the church is central in counseling ministry,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   and I hope you will indeed embrace that.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.800]   At the bottom of page 3,
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.080]   let's look at the nature of the church,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.800]   and we'll just walk through this together.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.560]   I have this summary statement,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.720]   this definition that the church is a unique spiritual organism
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.680]   empowered by the ministry of the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.880]   made up of believers, both Jew and Gentile,
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.360]   connected to the head who is the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.960]   and given the mission to make disciples of all the nations.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.480]   I know that's a handful.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.640]   You could also pick through each of those components in
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.200]   that definition and find a rich understanding of the church,
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.160]   but just a couple of elements here.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.080]   It is a spiritual organism.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.640]   The church was birthed on the day of Pentecost on Acts 2,
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.680]   by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   The church has been baptized into the person and the power of
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.240]   the Holy Spirit and proclaims the gospel because of
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.640]   the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.160]   Just again at the statement,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.640]   at the risk of overstating the obvious,
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.520]   the church is made up of believers.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.800]   The church is made up of believers in Christ.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.920]   You would think we wouldn't need to restate that point today,
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.760]   but actually we do,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.040]   because people are promoting this view of the church that
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.800]   says that the church is just a gathering of
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.920]   people with varying levels of interest in Jesus.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.360]   We need to go back to the basic idea
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.440]   here that the church is made up of believers.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.160]   The church is the ecclesia,
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.560]   the called out ones,
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.520]   those who've been called out of the world and called into
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.040]   a relationship with Jesus Christ and into
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.640]   a relationship with those who belong to Jesus Christ.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.320]   On page 4 of your handout,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.280]   you have that great statement by Jesus in Matthew 16, verse 18.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.200]   I tell you, you are Peter and on this rock,
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:41.360]   I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.840]   Now, what I want to do at this point is give you
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.040]   five illustrations or descriptions of the church that are found in scripture.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.960]   I'm going to run through these briefly in our time remaining.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:58.720]   You can do much study on each of these illustrations or descriptions.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:05.120]   You would do well to choose three or four of these descriptions,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.960]   and do your own study,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.440]   put it in your own words.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.680]   Again, you're communicating in your essay,
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.800]   you're writing as if you are communicating these concepts to a counselee,
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.840]   and so you're putting it in your own language.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.960]   How would you communicate this concept to
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.680]   someone who you're trying to minister to?
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.080]   But you would do well to find at least three of
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.600]   these descriptions and develop a full paragraph on each of them.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.040]   If you want to go and do all five,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.160]   you're certainly welcome to do that.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.240]   I'm not sure if you could get all of that in to a page and a half,
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.080]   but at least three or four of these illustrations
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:50.920]   would be the basis for a good essay on this topic.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:58.440]   I'm going to run through these briefly and try to resist the temptation to belabor the point here.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:03.160]   But illustration number 1 is that the church is the beloved bride of Christ.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.920]   Ephesians 5, verse 25,
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:10.120]   "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.480]   The key idea here is one of spiritual union.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   Ephesians 5, verse 31,
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.440]   "Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.960]   and the two shall become one flesh."
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.760]   This mystery is profound,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.040]   and I'm saying that refers to Christ and the church.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.920]   Paul is saying there in Ephesians 5 that the unity that exists between
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.640]   husband and wife in the one flesh relationship is
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:41.360]   an illustration of the union between Christ and the church.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.120]   The church is the beloved bride of Christ.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:52.600]   Now, this will drive your own passion for the church.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:59.560]   That Christ loves the church and considers the church to be the very bride of Christ.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:04.520]   So a number of scriptures there that you could think through.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.880]   But I just bring to you a simple application of this truth.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:15.880]   How we treat the local church is how we treat Jesus Christ.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.360]   I'm sure someone could say, "Well, Dan,
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.200]   I really don't like your wife,
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.280]   but I really love you.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   I really want a relationship with you,
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.160]   but I don't want a relationship with your wife."
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.720]   I would say, "We are one flesh,
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.080]   we're one, we're in the covenant of marriage,
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.720]   and if you want a relationship with me,
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.840]   it means that you're going to have a relationship with my wife as well.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.280]   You can't say you love me and that you don't love my wife because we're one."
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.960]   In a similar way, there are many who say,
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.760]   "Well, I really love Jesus,
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.160]   but I just can't stand his church.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:55.000]   I really love Jesus, but I can't stand the people of the church."
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.400]   Biblically, that is really an impossible concept.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.720]   How you treat the church is how you treat Christ because the church
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:08.440]   is the beloved bride of Christ.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.040]   Matthew 10, verse 40 says,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.760]   "Whoever receives you receives me,
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:17.280]   and whoever receives me receives him who sent me."
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.080]   That'll radically change your relationship with your church.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:25.840]   When you realize theologically speaking that how you treat the members of
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   your church is how you are treating Jesus Christ himself,
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.320]   because the church is the very bride of Christ,
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:38.000]   it will change how you relate to the people of your church,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.880]   and how you serve,
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.960]   and how you support your church.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:50.880]   Let me move to the second illustration here and say that the church is the body of Christ.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.800]   Again, the main idea here is one of unity,
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.040]   that Christ is the head and we are the body of Christ.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.240]   Again, a simple illustration.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.400]   Someone, I suppose, might say, "Well,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   Dan, I'm just going to punch you in the arm,
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.960]   but don't worry, don't take offense.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.880]   I'm not punching you, I'm just punching your arm."
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.840]   I would say, "Well, if you're punching my arm,
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.760]   you're punching me because this is my body.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:22.520]   My arm is part of my body and you can't separate my body from me."
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:31.480]   The similar truth is true of Christ's relationship with the church.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.320]   How you treat the body of Christ is how you treat Christ himself.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:42.400]   How you treat the members of the body of Christ is how you treat the head who is Christ.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.440]   First Corinthians 12, verse 12,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.120]   "For just as the body is one and has many members,
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.880]   and all the members of the body,
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.520]   though many are one body,
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.400]   so it is with Christ."
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   Now, verse 27 says,
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:00.000]   "You are the body of Christ and individually members of it."
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.640]   Paul's point in that passage is that you cannot affect
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.320]   one part of the body without affecting the entire body.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.200]   When one member hurts,
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.480]   the entire body hurts,
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:18.520]   and each member of the body is necessary for the proper functioning of the body.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:24.040]   The body has different parts and all of them function differently from each other.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.960]   When people say to me, "Dan,
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:31.240]   I don't feel like I'm part of this church because I'm different from everyone else in this church.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.120]   Maybe I'm a different ethnicity,
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.040]   or I'm a different age and stage in life,
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.960]   or I have different hobbies,
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.480]   or I have different interests,
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.960]   or just a different personality.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.320]   I don't feel like I fit in," and I say to them,
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.880]   "If you feel like you're different from everyone else in this church,
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.080]   that is all the more reason why we need you here."
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.320]   Because the whole point of the body of Christ is we are made up of
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.680]   members who are different from one another.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.280]   We don't need 100 ears in the church.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.680]   We don't need 100 eyes in the church.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.280]   We don't need five livers or five hearts.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:12.200]   We need each member of the body functioning exactly how God has designed them to function.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:19.560]   So that is the point of the church being the very body of Christ.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:25.600]   So just a wonderful concept that the church is the body of Christ.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.760]   The third illustration at the bottom of page 5 of your handout,
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   the church is the flock of Christ.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.840]   John 10, verse 11, Jesus says, "I'm the good shepherd.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:42.040]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.960]   Admittedly, as I've said in other classes,
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:50.320]   this is not the most flattering metaphor to compare believers to the sheep of God
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.200]   and compare the church to being the flock of God.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.920]   Sheep are the dumbest and the dirtiest of all the animals in the world.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.480]   They can't kick, they can't bite,
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.160]   they can't scratch, they can't claw,
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.800]   they can't defend themselves.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.200]   They're easy prey for savage wolves.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.720]   They need constant care and constant protection.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.400]   Sheep are always getting lost.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.040]   They're always going astray.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.400]   Believe me, if you have a heart of a shepherd,
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.840]   you will never lack sheep who need your shepherding care.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.720]   And if your counseling ministry at your church has the heartbeat of a shepherd,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:37.640]   then you will always be pulling sheep out of a whole lot of trouble.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.920]   The church is not an organization that needs to be managed.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:46.240]   The church is a flock that needs to be shepherded.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.520]   And by the way, I would just say this on a personal note.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.320]   This is why I am a biblical counselor.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:58.000]   This is why I got trained to be a biblical counselor and got into the organization ACBC.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.760]   It is not so much that I'm passionate about counseling ministry in and of itself,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.200]   but it really is that I'm passionate about being a shepherd,
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.440]   that God has called me to be a shepherd,
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:17.200]   and that God has called all of us to have the heartbeat of a shepherd,
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:22.920]   because Jesus is the good shepherd who lays down his life for the flock.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.840]   And counseling is a means to express shepherding care.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.360]   Counseling is a means of rescuing lost sheep.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.920]   Counseling is a means of protecting straying sheep.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:41.000]   Counseling is a means of restoring wounded sheep.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.720]   In fact, it is an incredibly effective way of expressing the shepherding care of Christ.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:52.280]   When else do you get this opportunity to express shepherding care into people's lives
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.800]   when they come to you with their problems and their spiritual struggles?
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.680]   And so I'm passionate about shepherding because I serve the good shepherd who is Christ.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.920]   And counseling is one means to express that shepherding care.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:14.920]   And that is why I'm passionate about counseling because that is what the church is.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:20.960]   We are shepherds who give shepherding care to the flock of God.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.720]   And we always need more shepherds because there's always more straying sheep
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:32.880]   than there are shepherds who are capable and willing to go after those sheep.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:39.000]   And so we need counselors who reflect the character of the great shepherd.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.160]   And Jesus said, if you have a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.440]   you're not happy with the 99 sheep that you have.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:51.480]   You leave the 99, you go after the one, and you bring that one sheep back into the fold.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:57.680]   Each sheep in the flock of God is worthy of shepherding care.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:02.280]   Jesus said to Peter three times in John chapter 21, when he restored him into ministry,
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.320]   Peter, do you love me?
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.680]   And Peter said, yes, Lord, you know that I love you.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:12.000]   And he said to him, feed my sheep.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.160]   This is what the church is.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:19.880]   And this is why we must have more biblical counselors.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:24.680]   Illustration number four, the church is the family of God.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.800]   When you become a Christian, you lose the world, you gain a family.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:33.360]   We're adopted as the children of God by our father in heaven.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.320]   We cry out to him, Abba, Father.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:44.280]   And if we are all children of God in Christ, and what that makes us is a spiritual family.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:52.260]   We treat in the words of first Timothy five verse one, older men as fathers, younger men
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:59.160]   as brothers, older women as mothers, younger women as sisters in all purity.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.560]   First Timothy three verse four says that the qualification of an elder is he must manage
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:08.860]   his own household well, with all dignity, keeping his children submissive.
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:14.480]   For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   church?
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:21.080]   The church implication, the church is the household of God, made up of the family of
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.240]   God, and the church needs to be managed.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:30.740]   And if an elder can't manage his own children, then how is he going to manage the household
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.560]   of God?
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:38.220]   First Timothy three verse 15, if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.100]   household of God.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:44.320]   So we're the family of God, and that's a wonderful concept, but it also means that each of us
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.200]   need to learn how to behave in the family of God.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.840]   If I have one word to say to church members, it would be behave, because you're part of
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.480]   the household of God.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:04.600]   Learn how to act within this family, and that requires learning to know that you're not
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:11.480]   always the most important person in the room on any given ministry event.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.080]   And so this is the family of God.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:20.480]   We are brothers and sisters in Christ, and that makes a huge difference in counseling.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:25.820]   When I meet with a believer, when I say to that believer, "I'm your brother in Christ,"
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:33.320]   it isn't the professional clinical model of a top-down type of dispensing of advice, but
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:39.520]   it is one brother coming alongside of another and giving encouragement and hope and help
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.440]   from God's word.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:46.340]   And then a final illustration, illustration number five is that the church is the dwelling
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.360]   place of God.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.000]   In the Old Testament, you have the tabernacle, which was a temporary tent, and it says in
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.680]   Exodus 40, verse 34, that the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:07.040]   Later on in Old Testament history, the temple was built and a permanent structure was given,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:12.160]   which was the center of the life of the nation of Israel, and it says that the glory of the
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.840]   Lord filled the house of the Lord.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.080]   We know that God is omniscient and God is omnipresent.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:24.720]   He is everywhere at all times, and yet in a special way, the tabernacle and the temple
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:29.800]   were the dwelling place of God.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:36.440]   And in the New Testament era, that temple or the temple is the church.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:42.960]   The church is not a physical temple made by hands, but the church is a spiritual temple
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:49.720]   made up of living stones that are perfectly fit together, founded on the cornerstone of
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:57.320]   the temple, who is Christ, and as Ephesians 2, verse 22 says, in him that is Christ, you
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:07.440]   also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the spirit.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.640]   I'll just end with this.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   Biblical counseling, that is an expression of the local church's ministry, offers to
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:26.240]   the world what no secular resource could ever offer, which is the very presence of God through
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:33.440]   his Holy Spirit, the very blessing of God upon each of the counseling meetings of the
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.500]   church.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.240]   No secular resource can offer this.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:44.800]   A counselor who is part of the New Testament temple, which is being built by God into the
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:51.560]   dwelling place of God, no secular counselor can bring into a counseling session the very
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:59.360]   presence and the blessing and the ministry of the Holy Spirit, who uses his word to change
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.320]   lives for his glory.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:10.680]   No secular counseling system can offer a counselor who is filled with the scriptures, who is
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:16.840]   part of the bride and the body of Christ, and who is filled with the Holy Spirit of
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.840]   God.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:22.800]   And that is why we love the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.720]   That is why we approach this ministry with joy and anticipation.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:32.040]   That is why, although we deal with a lot of different problems, that we are excited about
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.460]   this ministry.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:42.080]   We believe that God will bless this ministry because we are an extension of the church,
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:47.960]   which is the body and the bride of Christ, the very dwelling place of God.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:52.840]   And we know that we offer to our counselees and to the world what the world could never
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.580]   offer.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.520]   And so do a good study.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:01.160]   I just encourage you to do a good study on this subject, not only for the sake of writing
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:08.360]   an essay, but for the sake of enriching your own understanding of the church, of being
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:15.000]   more committed to your own church, for being more passionate about the ministry of your
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   church.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:26.160]   And we trust that God will use this topic in your life to launch counseling ministry,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:33.320]   to be a catalyst for counseling ministry to take place in the local church for God's glory.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.760]   So I trust that you'll be encouraged as you study this topic.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.980]   We are going to conclude our class next week with the final topic of the year, Theology
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:49.440]   Exam number 24, where we'll take this broad understanding of the church and then apply
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.560]   it specifically to how does counseling ministry work in this church.
[00:59:55.560 --> 01:00:00.960]   But you'll see that these are very critical topics, and I trust that they will be a blessing
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.960]   to your life.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.260]   So thank you again for joining us tonight on the live stream.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:11.080]   We hope you will have a safe and a blessed week.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:15.520]   And let me close this tonight in a word of prayer, and then we'll be dismissed.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   Let's pray.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.240]   Father, we do thank you for the church.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240]   Thank you for this study.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:27.440]   Thank you for this hour that we've spent just reminding ourselves of what the church is.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.960]   And we thank you that this is the church that Christ has purchased with his own blood.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:41.360]   Help us to love the church because Christ loves the church, and we pray that you would
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:47.820]   develop in us a conviction that counseling ministry does belong in the church.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:55.480]   Help us to, in our own lives, echo not only the teaching of Scripture, but also the sentiments
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:05.000]   of Pastor DeCourcy, who so well said that the church ought to be the first port of call.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.080]   The church ought to be the first place that people seek help for their problems, and that
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.920]   we do have the resources to help people through your word.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.700]   So bless each of my brothers and sisters here, and give us a great week of study, and bring
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:29.360]   us back together next Sunday to continue and to conclude our study of these topics.
