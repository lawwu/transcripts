[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540]   Is God's God-centeredness precious to you?
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.000]   This question is one of those continental divides of all theological systems.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.840]   How you answer it determines how your entire theology develops.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.200]   Is God's God-centeredness precious to you?
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.560]   I pick up the conversation in Pastor John's trip this year to Northern Ireland.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.660]   What makes it interesting here is the biographical context that gets pulled into the topic, something
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.600]   I have not heard about before.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.360]   Here now is Pastor John talking about God's holiness in His glory.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.720]   Here's where we pick up the conversation.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:51.040]   I think in biblical terms generally, I can't make this work in every text, I would just
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.880]   say generally, the holiness of God, not to talk about the holiness of temple utensils
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:10.640]   or people, the holiness of God is generally His intrinsic beauty and greatness and worth.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.320]   And when that goes on display, the Bible calls it His glory.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.720]   They're not radically different realities.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.720]   God is who He is, right?
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.720]   He's great.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.680]   He's beautiful.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.400]   He's infinitely valuable in Himself without any creation in existence.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   But when the heavens were created, they were telling the glory of the Lord.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.080]   When the Son of God came, we saw His glory.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.560]   God is the only Son from the Father.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:59.760]   The glory of God is the intrinsic worth, the intrinsic beauty, the intrinsic greatness
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.000]   gone public for you to admire and worship and enjoy.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.040]   Hebrews 1, 3 speaks of a radiance of the glory of God.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.120]   Psalm 19 speaks of the heavens telling the glory of God as you see what God has put out
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.400]   there to communicate what cannot be seen.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.960]   You're supposed to see the planets and the stars and the blue sky and the cloud formations
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.640]   and the entire natural world and know this is a great God.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.160]   This is a glorious God.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.080]   This is a beautiful God.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:55.040]   This is a true, valuable, infinitely glorious, beautiful being.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.960]   Why do I choose these three words?
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.080]   Greatness and beauty and value.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.600]   I'm not just throwing those words out there.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.040]   Are those the three words that I should use?
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.200]   By greatness I am referring to His scope, His extent, His grandeur.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.400]   I mean, there's no geography, no dimensions in God, but we use language, the Bible uses
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.240]   language of greatness.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.760]   So that's what that is.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.960]   Scope, extent, grandeur.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:45.080]   Beauty, the perfections of all His attributes and the infinite harmony of their interrelationships.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.480]   View to list all the attributes of God that are revealed in the Bible.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.240]   They would all be beautiful, but the totality of the beauty of the glory would be not only
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:05.400]   each one's individual beauty, but the harmony of them all as they get shown in history and
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.520]   in salvation and judgment.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:17.120]   And third, His worth, because the Bible reveals Him as a treasure, more precious, more valuable,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.560]   more to be desired than anything or anyone in the universe.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.040]   And that may be the one that you need to hear most.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.680]   I certainly need to hear it most, because your heart is going after treasures every
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.040]   day.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.080]   Every day your heart is latching onto something satisfying, something precious, something
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.840]   you want.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.280]   And the Bible's message is He's the most wantable reality in the world.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.840]   If you don't feel it, you're wrong.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.600]   You're broken.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:59.120]   So those three things, greatness, beauty, and worth, this is the glory of God on display.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.160]   Now my experience is, I'm 73 years old, I've been talking about my love for the glory of
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.840]   God for about 50 years.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.560]   My experience is that the greatness and beauty and worth of God, the glory of God, they don't
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.280]   become dominant in a heart, in a mind.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.560]   They don't become a dominant reality.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:31.880]   They didn't in my life, until I saw how dominant the glory of God was to God.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   I grew up in a home, my dad probably mentioned the term glory of God in almost every prayer
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.960]   he prayed in my presence, and that was every night that he was home from his evangelistic
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   work.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.760]   He pronounced it glory, glory.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.520]   He divided the syllables after O, glory, not glory.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.480]   I love it, because it's just stuck there.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.360]   Do everything for the glory of God.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.440]   And my mother would sign off on letters to me in college and graduate school, whatever
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.320]   you do, in word or deed, do everything to the glory of God.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.080]   But they never, to my, I'm sure this is not true, but you know, the memories of kids are
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.120]   distorted.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.280]   I don't remember them ever saying, "God lives for the glory of God.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.720]   God exists for the glory of God.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.800]   God does everything he does for his glory."
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.640]   And when that began to come home to me, and I had to wrestle with whether I liked a God
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.240]   like that, my life shifted.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   I was newly married.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.520]   We were just in seminary, and I remember saying, "Noel, you know, one of the biggest evidences
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.880]   that your world is being turned upside down by the centrality of God in the mind of God
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.160]   is your prayers."
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.280]   I mean, why is the first petition of the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be your name."
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.640]   Like, take yourself seriously.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   That's not for him.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.360]   That's for us.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.640]   We got to get in sync with that because Jesus said, "That's one.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.240]   That's number one.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240]   Kingdom next.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.240]   Will next."
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   Or do I get backwards?
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   "Hallowed be thy name.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   Thy kingdom come.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   Thy will be done."
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.920]   First three petitions, "God, God, God, do it for yourself."
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   Powerful.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.880]   God's God-centeredness is so important.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.400]   That was a clip from John Piper's trip in July to Belfast, Northern Ireland.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.060]   If you want a more developed theology of the God-centeredness of God, be sure to check
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.520]   out, well, really just about any book by John Piper, to be honest, but especially you'll
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.560]   find this theme concentrated in his book on missions, "Let the Nations Be Glad."
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.880]   That book title, "Let the Nations Be Glad."
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.720]   You'll find the God-centeredness of God to be especially thick in that book.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.880]   Thank you for listening along.

[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.760]   Speaking of God's God-centeredness, how should that reality shape what TV shows and movies
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.760]   we bench?
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.360]   That's the question on the table Friday.
