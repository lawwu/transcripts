[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Why did Jesus need a body?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   It's such a foundational question, but it's also one we typically don't dwell on, except maybe around Christmas.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   It's a question we need to dwell on. We need to linger here for a moment.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   In 1995, John Piper expanded on this question at the end of a sermon on Ephesians 4, 32-5, 2.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Here's what he said in explaining why Jesus needed a body.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Now turn your attention for just one last minute or two away from the life to the sacrifice.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   The sacrifice, the costliness of this life being laid down.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   You know, one of the differences between the 19-year-old boy and Jesus is that in order for Jesus to suffer and die,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   he had to plan it way ahead of time, because as the logos who existed before creation, he couldn't die.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Immortal. He didn't have any body. He could not die.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And yet he wanted to die for you.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So he planned the whole thing by clothing himself with a body so that he could get hungry and get weary and get sore feet.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   The incarnation is the preparation of nerve endings for the nail.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   That's what the incarnation is.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   The incarnation is the preparation of a brow for thorns to press through.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   He needed to have a broad back so that there was a place for the whip.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   He needed to have feet so that there was a place for spike.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He needed to have a side so that there was a place for the sword to go in.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He needed cheeks, fleshy cheeks, so that Judas would have a place to kiss,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and there would be a place for the spit to run down that the soldiers put on him.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He needed a brain and a spinal column with no vinegar and no gall
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   so that the exquisiteness of the pain could be fully felt.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I just plead with you.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   When you're reading the Bible and you read water toy texts like "He loved you and gave himself for you,"
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   you wouldn't go too fast over it.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You would linger, linger, linger, and plead with him that your eyes would be open.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Let me close with a question.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Can you, will you now take this personally for yourself?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You know what Satan wants to do right now?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   He has not been able to stop me this morning from describing to you the love of Christ and its depth.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   What he could do right now, maybe, is in a subtly, even spiritual way,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   get into your brain and cause you to put that picture that I've just tried to paint for you,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   of the love of Christ for you, on your coffee table like a big glossy book of canyons.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Called "Canyons." "U.S. Canyons."
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And you flip through the book and you go, "Oh, I've got those wonderful canyons."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And then you walk away to the kitchen and you murmur and you act unlovingly and your voice is unkind.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Here we are standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon this morning.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   We've seen some of it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We need wings now. We need wings.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We don't want photographs.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   We don't want to say, "The love of Christ is great."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   There it is! There it is! It's on the screen!
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And we say, "Wow!"
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We do a worship thing on it and we do a teaching thing on it.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And it's still on the screen!
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's in the book!
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And Satan would be...
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   If that's what he's got to settle for, admiring Jesus from a distance,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and having no root, no involvement, no hang gliding,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   in and through the Grand Canyon,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   he would be satisfied.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So I'm going to close with a testimony from the Apostle Paul,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and just pray with you as we close that it would become true for you.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Galatians 2.20.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I remember back in 1966,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   when I got mononucleosis and was in the hospital for three weeks.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And Chaplain Welch came in, and as he was leaving, the first time,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   he turned and looked over his shoulder and said, "John, what's your favorite Bible verse?"
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And I hadn't thought about what my favorite Bible verse was.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And out of my mouth came Galatians 2.20.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I am crucified with Christ.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who now lives in me.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And the life that I now live in the flesh,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   nitty-gritty daily life that everybody has to live,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   the life that I now live in the flesh,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Would you take that, please?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Take that personal pronoun.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Don't say "you." Don't say "us."
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Those are true.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Would you say "me?"
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   The life that I now live,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   and gave himself for me.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That's the love that I want you to send your roots down into.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It will make a great difference in our church, in your life, in your family.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I would do that, I pray it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   All the people said, "Amen."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yes, amen.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   That clip was from John Piper's March 26, 1995 sermon titled,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "The Depth of Christ's Love, Its Cost."
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And it was sent in to us by Wes Vitito in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Thank you, Wes, for the clip.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You can find the full message at DesiringGod.org, of course.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   On Wednesdays, we dip into the archive and pull out a classic clip for the podcast.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I welcome your suggestions.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   If you have a favorite clip from a John Piper sermon, old or recent,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   email us the name of the sermon and the time stamp of when and where the clip occurs in the audio.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And email it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast with author and longtime pastor, John Piper.
