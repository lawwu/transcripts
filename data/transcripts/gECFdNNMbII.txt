[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.380]   All right.
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.720]   Another deep life question here.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.580]   This one is from Penelope.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.920]   Penelope asks, what's it like to be a published author?
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.360]   And how do you keep sane amid all the competition
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.040]   and obsession with book sales and contracts?
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.280]   You can't-- Penelope, you can't pay much attention to it.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.600]   Writing is weird, especially if you're
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.960]   doing big scale professional nonfiction writing like I do.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.040]   It's weird and stochastic.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.640]   Some books blow up.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.440]   Some don't.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.320]   It's complicated.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.200]   No one can understand necessarily why.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.880]   It's like a confusing world.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.120]   Sometimes you come across a book, you're like, this is--
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.640]   I get it.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.600]   It's a really interesting story, or it's really original,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.480]   or it's Danny Kahneman is writing Thinking Faster,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   Slow, and it's his life's work, and he's finally
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   put into a book.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.960]   I kind of get that.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.640]   And then sometimes it's random.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.040]   It's like, I don't know.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.760]   Why did-- why does James Clear's book on habits 5x outsell
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.200]   Charles Duhigg's book on habits?
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.640]   I don't know.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.160]   Why did-- why is Mark Manson's first book, The Subtle Art
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.240]   of Not Giving Enough Word, why did that sell 12 million copies?
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.960]   It's a great book.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.960]   But there's a lot of great books that don't--
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.720]   he doesn't know.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.320]   I've asked him.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.240]   It's like, I don't know.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.520]   So you can't worry about it.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.880]   So how do you not worry about it?
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.600]   Well, I'll tell you what I do is I never signed up
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.840]   for the author portals.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.080]   I don't know how to look up sales numbers on my books.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.840]   My agent will mention things to me.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.760]   My editors will sometimes mention things to me.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.920]   I'm like, that sounds great.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.600]   But I mainly find out how well my books
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.080]   are doing twice a year when I get my royalty statements.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.120]   I'm like, ah, that's great.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.080]   And I think that has done really well.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.660]   Contracts, don't worry about book contracts.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.080]   That's such a small percentage of your time
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.840]   where that's relevant.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600]   Like, oh, I'm working on a book contract now.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.880]   Great.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160]   And then it'll be two years again
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.920]   until you're working on another book contract again.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.700]   You're just sort of writing at that point.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.800]   So don't worry about that.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.000]   But Penelope, that's my advice.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.240]   It's not that you're going to do this perfectly.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.440]   But you just can't compare.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.400]   It's like a weird stochastic world.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.240]   Why one book does well over here tells you nothing
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.900]   about how your book should do over here.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.640]   Maybe this book should do really well, and it doesn't.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.360]   Or it's going really slow, and then it does really well later.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.480]   What I always do is just focus on the next book.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.920]   So when I have a book out, I don't look up at sales numbers
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.040]   because I don't know how.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.960]   And I always just get to the mindset of, well,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.120]   forget that book, this new one.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.040]   This is the one that's going to be a home run.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.800]   I was rushed for that one, but this one's
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   going to be the home run.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.160]   I just get my attention towards what's happening in the future.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.240]   Interesting story.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.480]   I've talked about this before.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.320]   I have a lot of books that seem slow and then sold a lot later.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.920]   So "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.080]   That came out in 2012.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.540]   That was my first major hardcover release.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.200]   I had written those three student books.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.440]   It was my first major hardcover idea book.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.880]   Got a reasonable advance for it, a lot of energy behind it.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.680]   And nothing really happened much when it came out.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.480]   And so I think it was considered--
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.160]   assuming it was considered a failure because a couple years
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.680]   later when I sold "Deep Work," they
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.600]   knocked $50,000 off the advance that I got for "So Good They
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   Can't Ignore You."
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.520]   Like, yeah, I don't think this book worked.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.120]   It's 2012.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.320]   Fast forward to today, that book has sold 300-plus thousand
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.920]   copies.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.720]   It's a very successful book, but you never
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.360]   would have known it.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.920]   "Deep Work" has sold a million copies.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.760]   But I was worried when "Deep Work" first came out.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.160]   I was on the phone frustrated with my agent.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.480]   My friends can't even find this in Barnes & Noble.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   No one cares about this book.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.680]   So sometimes it's random.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.000]   You think something's not going to do well,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.680]   and then it does really well later.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.000]   Or you think something's going to do really well,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.080]   and it never does.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.840]   So write the next one.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.720]   Don't look at sales numbers.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.520]   Write the next one.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.460]   (upbeat music)
