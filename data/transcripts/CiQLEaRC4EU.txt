[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs, where we give you practical insights into jobs and
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.920]   careers.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.240]   Today, we're joined by Sarah Burley and Gareth Strange.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.040]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.880]   - Good, thanks, Tim.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   - Very well.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.360]   - All right, so I worked with you at a previous company in everything around a topic of brand.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.920]   Can you tell me a little bit about what you're doing today?
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:35.240]   - Well, today is bank holiday in the UK, and so we're in true kind of working-for-yourself
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.580]   style, trying to catch up and hit some deadlines today, and we're going away with work next
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.280]   week, actually, so we're sort of working towards that, so it's a lot of fun.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.040]   - So you and I, we got introduced to each other at a previous company, where you're
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.440]   an agency, and you're dealing with everything brand.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.960]   Can you tell us a little bit about John and Jane and what your roles are?
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.160]   - Yeah, sure, so John and Jane is a tiny design and branding studio in Wales.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.360]   We started it seven and a half years ago now, so the name John and Jane is basically us
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360]   two.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.960]   It's our middle names, but it was also a concept around kind of wanting to put the work first
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.400]   and let the names take a backseat, kind of like slightly linked to John and Jane Doe,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.360]   but yeah, we set up seven and a half years ago to do branding, design, strategy, and
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.800]   Sarah's skillset of being very good with discovery and very good with the strategy side of things,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.160]   and I take care more of the visual side, so our skillsets complement each other really
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   well.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.440]   So over the last seven and a half years, we've been working with lots of different types
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.000]   of clients, from tiny little businesses to big tech companies, and it's been fun so far.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.240]   So I'm kind of curious, so just for historical speaking for everyone, so it's been many years
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.360]   since we've worked together.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.360]   Early this calendar, actually last calendar year, I went through a period of unemployment,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.320]   and so I was just trying to figure out what I wanted to do, and from that time of self-discovery,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.080]   this podcast idea was born, and I'm kind of curious, before I even got it off the ground,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.000]   what is it that you saw that made you want to get involved?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.640]   Because I can tell you guys, I was really struggling with that final 10% of getting
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.280]   this thing off the ground, and your involvement was so impactful that I hit that reset button
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.840]   on that intended launch date.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.040]   So can you just tell me a little bit about why you decided to work with me, and what
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   did you see that you thought you could provide some help and value?
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.120]   Well, obviously, like you said, we worked together at your previous agency, and we collaborated
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.920]   on quite cool brand new projects there, and always enjoyed working with you, and the collaboration
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.280]   was always good.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.680]   So obviously, we've linked on LinkedIn, and I think it comes back to that thing of being
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.720]   almost open with the process a little bit, which I think designers are well-known for
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.800]   kind of keeping everything buried down, but when you are open to the community, and you
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.600]   share your struggles, and it's not just all a big show reel, you kind of open up the conversation
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   for other people to come in.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.480]   And I think as a designer sometimes, for me, when something like with John and Jane, as
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.280]   soon as John and Jane had a logo, it kind of felt real then.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   So when you kind of shared a video, I think it was a video or a post, talking about your
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.200]   process, you've got this idea for the podcast, you've got the set of colors that you want
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.040]   to work with, but you felt the typography wasn't quite right.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.480]   And straightaway, I could see how we could potentially help you.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.800]   And the idea of collaborating again, was obviously very appealing.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.720]   So I reached out, and yeah, the rest is history.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.360]   Yeah, I think when we chatted about it internally, as we sort of saw your story progress, really.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.940]   And I think like Gareth said, he obviously straightaway had ideas visually about how
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.680]   we could potentially help you provide some sort of assets, because that's obviously what
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.600]   you were sort of talking about and looking for.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.360]   And then also, we just had a lot of time for what you were doing, we loved the fact that
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.840]   you were, like Gareth said, being very open and transparent.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.880]   And I think, as you mentioned multiple times on your podcast, job market can be pretty
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.000]   scary and quite isolating, quite cold.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.080]   And I think, you know, over the years, we've sort of always been really interested in that
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.500]   community side of sharing that kind of genuine experience, because let's be honest, there's
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.420]   a lot of kind of gloss and getting underneath that, I think it's so helpful for other people
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.860]   and really rewarding and helpful for ourselves, let's be honest, like, you know, sharing that
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.860]   genuine experience.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.620]   So I think from a copy and messaging perspective, as well, it was like, not not easy, but we
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620]   were kind of really feeling it.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.620]   So we had some ideas.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.180]   And we thought, well, you know, maybe, maybe we can collaborate and help in some way.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.440]   So what you're referring to was, you know, during that time, I'd released a video, talking
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.140]   about what I'm struggling with.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.920]   And there was a video specifically where I had reached out to the community and be like,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.840]   hey, look, if you guys need any help during this period, where we're all searching for
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.040]   jobs, like hit me up as a sounding board.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.200]   And that turned into some insights I discovered that time where people were just struggling
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.240]   on reinventing themselves or seeing if their, their skills can transition to other fields
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.080]   because they were not getting anything out there and on job market.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.280]   And so, yeah, I think I think you're right, that the authenticity to tone and how that
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.720]   is a baseline for brand and building credibility is really important.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.400]   And I'm kind of curious for in your guys' point of view, like, what makes a good brand
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.880]   and we can talk to how that applied to the work we did together.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.440]   But in general, like, what are you what are you typically looking for?
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.580]   You know, what is that process where you are able to evaluate maybe someone's brand presence
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.360]   or just whatever those elements are?
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:05.520]   And then what steps do you take to kind of start putting some, maybe a process or workflow
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.080]   around kind of getting that to a better place?
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.560]   Brand is a funny one, really, I think if you asked 100 people what branding is, you'd probably
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.340]   get dozens of different answers.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.840]   And it's a quote that we love, and we refer to when we're doing workshops all the time,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.020]   and we're branding, there's only one thing that matters, and that's everything.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.240]   And it's, and it's, it's kind of true, it's like a brand can go and spend a fortune building,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.060]   building an amazing visual brand, an amazing service, and that can all be torn down with
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.820]   like one bad customer service, potentially, and that could change the whole brand in someone
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.200]   in that one person's mind immediately.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.520]   So I think when we're working with brands, and we're trying to discover, like brands
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.280]   that we want to work with, brands that we want to help, it comes down to, I think a
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.280]   lot of the time is purpose.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   What are they trying to do?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.280]   Is there a real goal at the heart of it?
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   Is there a concept that we can kind of lean to?
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.280]   Is there a story we can, we can, we can cling on to?
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.280]   And I think that's the kind of going towards the sort of USP, you know, and that's obviously
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.360]   part of the discovery process, is always trying to figure that out, whether it's one person
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:20.400]   or, you know, a large organisational business.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   And I think that's a really key thing.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   But I think that that saying we like, it kind of does work across the board, because even
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.360]   speaking, like in terms of design, and like the visual offering, every single little thing
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   matters.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.680]   And the type of choice, you know, affects everything, the colour affects everything,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.940]   feeling, you know, represents a million things.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.560]   And I think the same could be said in terms of discovery, and that process that you mentioned,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.360]   because, you know, when that's what we can obviously do every day, and looking at a person
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.320]   or a group or a large organisation, we feel like, you know, our jobs is to filling that
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.220]   down into that kind of real essence of what they're, not only what their purpose is, but
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:06.040]   I think also what they do, and who they are, because we, you know, we have that second
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   snapshot.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.600]   And that's what branding helps us do, is to communicate in just a couple of seconds what
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   you're all about.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.200]   So we see that as our job, really, and it is literally starting really, really wide,
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   and just to sink down into that.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:22.040]   And I think that's the going back to the that video you put out, I think that one of the
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.400]   reasons was a few reasons we wanted to kind of reach out and help where we possibly could,
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.180]   because obviously, the past collaboration, but also, it was that sense of community was
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.340]   that sense that you you find yourself in that spot, where you were looking to then make
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.340]   connections and help others as well.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.340]   And it kind of reminds me of a remind both of us a little bit of Creative Mornings, that
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.620]   it's a global event, but Sarah actually started the Cardiff chapter about 10 years ago.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:53.220]   And it was all about just bringing people together and idea sharing and giving, giving
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.540]   back to the community, really, and yeah, so community has always been an important thing
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.540]   for us.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.540]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.280]   And yeah, quite often, that will come into the brand.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.420]   And as you know, you know, that's a huge thing now, even, you know, if you're selling a product
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:12.020]   or clothes or anything, or online platforms, it's, it's, it's, that community and building
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.300]   community has gotten more and more important, and more and more prevalent, hasn't it, that
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.620]   speak, and storytelling, all those sorts of things.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.140]   And I think they've always been there, but I just think that we're getting more and more
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.660]   sort of explicit terms for things, because the branding world is maturing, almost, you
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.260]   know, service, and these roles that we all have, which, to be honest, for a while, nobody
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.540]   really knew who, you know, what these specialisms were called, but of course, they're kind of
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.220]   starting to come clear now.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:44.220]   And those processes are starting to become a bit more recognisable, and, you know, and
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.220]   standardised, really.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.820]   And people aren't so surprised anymore, if you do speak about a discovery session, or,
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.940]   you know, that part of the branding process, rather than just having a logo, for example,
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.460]   people are a lot more enfei with that process, and understand that there's a bit more to
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.460]   it than that.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.340]   Yeah, you know, it's interesting, you're, you're coming about distilling things down
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:10.140]   to a core, that's easily understandable is really important, because that's where I struggled
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.140]   in the beginning.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:17.220]   So, like, I had this idea in my head of what I want this thing to be, but I couldn't put
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.260]   words to it, right.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.380]   And I remember in our first discovery session, you guys are real quick, you guys asked so
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.820]   many good questions, ranging from my vision, my and my purpose, my mission, and what I'm
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.800]   trying to do with this, what kind of takeaways do you want my audience to be getting from
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.300]   these videos, both from an emotional point of view, as well as professional.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:46.620]   And you took all that, and you distilled it down to a single problem or mission statement
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.980]   that characterized exactly what was going on between my ears.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.580]   And that was so helpful.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.900]   You know, I think a lot of companies, they, actually, the larger the company, the more
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.120]   personalities you have there, and a lot of influence on to what messaging is, the problem
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.860]   is then that you have so many perspectives, it's hard to boil it down to one single statement
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.660]   that can then be the foundation to build a brand.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.740]   And it was cool to see that happen firsthand, and you totally got it.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.900]   And I posted that on LinkedIn, because I was so excited about it, and it got a lot of reaction,
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.500]   you know, and people are like, "Oh, that's so cool."
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.420]   And like, "No, I totally get it."
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.660]   And the other way I've operationalized that is when I bring in additional guests, I usually
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.020]   I have like a letter that's sent out, and that's made its way into the letter, because
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.060]   it's articulating what I'm thinking in my vision and getting alignment.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:44.880]   And I'm kind of curious, you guys, because there's setting the message or messaging,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.660]   and then there's taking that and then applying, let's say, visual or stylings to it through
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.380]   like a, like you guys went through like a mood board exercise.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:59.380]   And up to that point, all I knew was that the, I guess the keywords that are important
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:07.620]   to me was like authenticity, professionalism, and then like relatability and transparency/genuine,
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.300]   right?
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.580]   And the only work I'd done after that point was thinking through colors.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.540]   And so the color I had kind of doubled down on was like blue, right?
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.100]   If anyone in the B2B is wondering like, why everyone uses blue, like, why did Dell use
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.100]   blue?
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.100]   Why did IBM use blue?
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.100]   And like, like LinkedIn uses blue?
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.740]   It's because blue represents confidence, right?
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.740]   And credibility.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.540]   And that's why those companies use it.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:39.700]   And the, so I decided I wanted blue, although I was testing between blue and purple, because
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.900]   I didn't know.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:46.160]   And the other color I wanted was orange, only because if you look at the color wheel, they're
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.520]   opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.220]   So the contrast really well.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:55.100]   And as a web marketer, I know that when it comes to like user engagement on websites,
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.460]   like, like a orange accent over blue tests really, really well, right?
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.460]   A lot of click through.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.540]   But that's literally it.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.220]   I struggled with the icon, a logo.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.260]   It looks very cartoony in the beginning because I was looking at all the other podcasts out
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.260]   there.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.260]   They look really fun and whatnot.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.740]   So that's, I tried to emulate that, but just nothing was hitting the mark.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.260]   So can you break down your process?
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.540]   Like when you saw that, what was your reaction?
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.220]   Was it positive or negative?
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.060]   And what kind of led you down the path of where you end up leading the design direction?
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.020]   When we, the question is, when we first saw like what you had put together?
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.580]   Like, what was your, like, was it like an adverse reaction or we're like, okay, now
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.300]   we knew, we know where we need to take this thing.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.380]   Well, I think it's just, I think it's potential.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.180]   I think we saw potential, I think in what you told us and what you were actually doing,
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.540]   it was so much potential to the project.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.900]   But I think a lot of the basics were there.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.900]   I think the color palette is, it was really strong and I think just kind of like, just
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.220]   tinkering with that a little bit and, and just all those things, all those things we
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.340]   learned, authentic, friendly, I think your personality has to come across that you are
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.940]   the personality of the podcast.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.940]   And it's obvious that you've had experience within and around branding as you have over
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   the years.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.820]   So I think you bring that information to this process as well, which is really helpful.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:19.140]   It means actually you are 10 steps ahead of perhaps where somebody who hasn't had that
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.140]   experience is.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.140]   So that's always helpful.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.780]   You might feel like maybe the end product needs some, you know, a bit of bit more work, but
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.260]   I mean that you're still 10 steps ahead.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.420]   So I think for us, any input like that, it's always helpful.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:37.380]   But I think your, your like ideas around color theory as well, were like well informed, is
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.020]   that you've got blue, which is a very trusted, very corporate color.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.940]   You are talking about corporate jobs a lot of the time, but then you've got that orange,
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.700]   which is a much like in terms of color theory, it's a happy, positive, creative color.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.860]   And you're bringing all that to, to this as well.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.740]   So, and again, like you said, they are opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.260]   They contrast really well.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.580]   And I just think we're doing like, like you've done a lot of digital marketing and web stuff
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.580]   and just A/B testing.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.020]   We've done a lot of that over the years as well.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.020]   And it's so interesting.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.660]   You put something up blue and then you put something up orange and it just outperforms.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.180]   And it's just, it's, I guess it just must be something to do with that color that just
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.820]   attracts people a little bit more.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.940]   But then when you've got both of them, you can kind of dial up and dial down and like
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.300]   you can use both colors.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.460]   So it's, yeah, I think when we, when we saw it, it was like, it all made a lot of sense.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.740]   But we just thought with the right typography, tweaking of the colors and identity that,
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.380]   I think you had a strong idea for the identity as well, which we kind of just helped nurture
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.380]   a little bit.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.740]   You also have some great photographs, which is massively helpful, you know, that they
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.860]   felt, they felt like you, they felt like talking to you as it were, and your personality came
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.860]   through.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.860]   And that's a big part of it.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.820]   I think we, we asked you to go and take these photographs and we just said, have fun with
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.620]   it, get your personality across and you didn't, you didn't hold back.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.100]   It's like, it's quite a difficult thing to do, isn't it?
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.340]   But you like, obviously starting off this, it's not like a big professional photo shoot
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.980]   or anything, but the photos you've got, I think you've, I was looking at the podcast
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:08.140]   on Apple podcast the other day and it just makes me so happy just seeing the cover and
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.140]   all the episodes there.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.980]   I think you've done a great job.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:17.220]   That was such a painful exercise because I am, I am not photogenic at all.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.780]   So it, it took me a long time to get to something where I was like, oh, this is probably worth
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.780]   sending to them.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.540]   And I, going through all, all my blinks, you know, and like the weird, awkward, like, it's
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.580]   like, it's like talented and nice.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.340]   It's like Ricky Bobby has like his hands, I was like, I don't know what to do with my
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.340]   hands.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.500]   It's pretty much that, but like in picture form.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.140]   So can you walk us through, maybe like the practical steps, you know, you mentioned things
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:46.020]   like having a strong perspective on your approach to typography or colors or how you turn that
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:51.680]   into a digital expression or whatever that looks like, right?
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.220]   What, what do you go with, like, what's your thinking process as you're choosing these?
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.940]   Like, like maybe walk us through how you think about fonts, you know, or colors or any of
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.020]   those elements that build up to your ultimate, you know, is your strategy or visuals?
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:12.100]   Well, I think like, especially, you know, using yourself as an example, I think that
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.360]   discovery and that sort of conversation and figuring out kind of what your manifesto is.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.780]   I think that that's where, well, that's the really sort of magical part of branding that
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.660]   we really enjoy working on together, isn't it?
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.100]   Because I think we collate all that information together, you know, but then there, there
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.580]   is that crossover point where maybe it's all up on the wall or the words, and then of course,
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.300]   it's translating that, as you say, into these sort of deliverables.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:41.260]   But, you know, in your, your case, you know, the type is kind of blurry, there's nothing's
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:47.340]   too sharp, nothing's too shiny, which is a direct sort of reference and translation to
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.620]   our messaging, which is, you know, life's not a straight line, you know, job, your job
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.740]   kind of career can be a mess, and that's okay, you know, humans are messy.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.940]   And so, you know, it's just bringing those sort of conceptual parts to it as well.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.300]   But, and that's kind of where I feel like then, of course, you formalise the type choices,
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.420]   the colour choices, and translate that into the design style.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.940]   Yeah, obviously, when it comes to typography and colours, it's all very subjective design.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.420]   But I think that's one thing that, why I love working with Sarah so much, she's so good
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.900]   at like drawing all that information out in a way that makes sense.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.420]   And just being part of those workshops, whether it's like a workshop with yourself, which
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.700]   is obviously a very small business, or where we have to go and do multiple workshops across
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.020]   multiple departments across multiple cities.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.020]   It's the process.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.780]   And I think that's, we've got that process that we know and trust.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.460]   When Sarah gives me that information, it is about then kind of making the right choices,
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.820]   what typeface is going to reflect your personality or the brand's personality in its best possible
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.820]   way.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.660]   And like Sarah said, we've got like a court wall here, and when we're working, we might
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.660]   put stuff up.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:01.300]   But what I tend to do is I sometimes like save logos or save typefaces to my screensaver
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.300]   on my phone.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.380]   I'll just look at it for the next couple of days, just let it like sink in.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.380]   Living with it.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.380]   Yeah, just living with it.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.860]   And then, and then you go, oh, maybe that's not quite right, and you move on.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.500]   And until you make a final decision, and just like we presented your brand, we always present
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.660]   just one concept, because we've gone through all these motions, like trying dozens of typefaces
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.820]   out, trying to find that right typeface that represents the brand, the way that we feel
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.820]   works best.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:32.240]   So when we present, we present confidently just that one concept, because if you present
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.780]   like three concepts, sometimes it can like confuse the client, they can say, oh, we like
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.700]   one, two, and maybe a little bit of three, and then you start having like a down kind
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.700]   of brand.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.460]   So I think it's our process to like, sit with it, live with it, and then just confidently
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.820]   present what we believe is the best solution for that brand.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.300]   I didn't know that.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.940]   And that's, that's fascinating.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.780]   When I was on the design that the agency side of the world, like earlier in my career, I
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.340]   did what you just suggested at the end, which is like, let's provide something that's a
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.980]   design concept that's like out of the world, kind of crazy borderline can't execute one
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:14.380]   super conservative, and something conservative, conservative, or maybe medium that they would
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.220]   most likely land on, and you hope that they pick elements of the others and kind of bring
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.220]   it to the middle.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:24.420]   But you're talking about going in, like guns blazing with double downing on one single
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.500]   concept, which I think is really, really brave.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:32.780]   You know, can you share some examples of maybe like a maybe a, a client where like that worked
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.660]   really, really well, and just took off?
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.020]   Or maybe some examples were like, that did not fly?
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.020]   And what did that look like?
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:44.660]   The good thing is, it's a process that is that we've developed, I think I worked with
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:50.460]   past agencies where the three or four concepts, which was the way, and what we always found
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.660]   as an internal team would be like, we like that concept, we hope they go with that concept,
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.660]   that's the best concept.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.380]   And maybe they go with another concept, or they would go with, and sometimes like a mashup
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.500]   of two concepts or three concepts.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.820]   So I think we it was something I tried years ago, when I was just doing a little bit of
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.660]   freelancing on the side of my, my nine to five job.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.460]   And it went so well, and it just made a lot of sense to me.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.700]   So so we've been doing it since we started John and Jane and touch wood, I'd say I'd
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.980]   say probably like nine times out of 10, the client signs off that first approach.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.660]   I don't think it's necessarily the easiest thing to do, because I think when we that's
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.660]   not to complain about it.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:35.220]   And I think that's, that's why we do it, but to have that one solo, and sort of executed,
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.060]   I think our job, then is to completely sell that and explain every sort of reason and
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.580]   rationale why it's like that.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:47.020]   And to be honest, usually, well, that's, that's the job is to make that impressive enough
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.860]   and as sort of rational enough that actually people feel really good, people feel really
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   seen.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.580]   And then actually, when you present the solution, they feel actually, yes, you've really like
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.620]   looked after, you know, because brand is people's babies, essentially, it's an expression of
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.620]   them.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   We appreciate that's a huge responsibility.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:10.780]   So we just try and honor that really, and, and really kind of, and essentially, that
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:16.380]   is selling it isn't it back, you know, which we that that that process is quite magical,
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:21.660]   I think, if people are really impressed and excited, then that's our job done, then that's
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:27.460]   we do have one client who she's moved jobs about three times in the last five, five years
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.460]   or so.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.620]   And whenever she moves jobs, she brings us in to rebrand the company.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.460]   And she refers to it, it's like having a baby, so she was like, I'm ready to have a baby.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.260]   And it's like, that's actually when she's like, got into a new job or something like
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.260]   that.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.260]   So it's obviously people do care.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.340]   And we care about it a hell of a lot as well.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.580]   And just making sure we do a good job.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.580]   But the good thing is, as well, that with that approach, it's it's not it can be seen
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.580]   as quite risky.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.380]   But like, like I said, we've probably got half a dozen, a dozen concepts in the background,
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.380]   anyway.
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.180]   So if they don't like that one concept, which, which we would be confident that they would
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.060]   feel it was right, we can say, give us a couple of days, we've got a bunch of other concepts,
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.940]   and we can put something else together fairly quickly as well, because they are, they are
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.940]   there.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.940]   So we've got those those concepts.
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.940]   I was actually wondering, Tim, about yourself.
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.140]   So obviously, you've been some agency side, you've been kind of lots of sides, actually
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.820]   watching the branding process and watching campaigns launch and web design, like, did
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:31.340]   it feel different having to creating a brand around yourself rather than sort of with other
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.340]   businesses?
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:39.180]   It was very, very different, and very enjoyable process and very, very scary.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.820]   When you guys are selling me the pitch, the visual one was really cool.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:51.500]   Could you so your pitch included this, you did the vision statement, you showed exposition
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:24:00.660]   on color, you explored the concept of a black and white or grayscale photo approach, which
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.540]   I'd never previously considered.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.260]   You showed different elements of the background that goes, like right now, everyone sees there
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.100]   is a blue and the orange slides in.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.020]   But like, it looks like now, now we landed, it was like, like, like a text, like a speech
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.020]   text bubble, whatever.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.660]   Oops, I hit my microphone.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.220]   But you gave me like multiple examples of what that would look like.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.860]   And there's ones where it was like a, like a fade or a blur.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.700]   And there's the typefaces, like you're talking about, like, things are confident, yet there's
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.420]   a lot of things are unsettled.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:36.260]   And you showed typefaces that kind of broke apart towards the end, I kind of think kind
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.260]   of faded.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:45.020]   And then, then you showed the logos on hats, a poster, you know, all these tangible things
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.980]   and made it feel very real.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.660]   And that was the first time I was like, oh, like, this can actually be like a real thing,
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.740]   like seeing it out in the wild.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.620]   You know, I haven't done the hat thing yet, it's on my list.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.460]   But that was really, really cool.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.580]   And that really hit home for me.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:06.980]   And it made me and now the baby, there's the brand, it feels like it's something that can
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.980]   actually happen.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.980]   And that's what got me over that last hump, where I knew I was like, you know what, this
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.900]   is totally worth doing a reset.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:21.360]   It was totally worth a potential awkward conversation where I already had a designer and you're
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.700]   coming in essentially undoing all of it.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.420]   But it was worth it.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.060]   That's kind of like what I was processing at the time.
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.060]   Yeah, it's not always easy.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.980]   And that goes to show even just, you know, on your own doing your own podcast, there's
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.220]   always some politics to deal with.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:44.700]   I feel like that's a huge part of the discovery phase of a rebrand or a new brand as well.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.700]   It's always emotional.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.380]   It's always because even if it's a sort of established brand, and you're going to change
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.780]   it, that's really tricky because people love the old brand, or maybe love some parts of
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.060]   the old brand, it just doesn't feel right to change it.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:04.180]   So you're up against that, you know, so there's always a lot of politics or kind of, yeah,
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.860]   I think that the discovery phase can help with that though, because it can really help
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:14.140]   everyone to put their view forward and have some part in shaping it.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.220]   And that helps people adopt it then, of course, and love it and think of it as their own.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.940]   So, you know, it's turning those challenges around, I think, and I appreciate that's tricky
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.660]   when, you know, you've maybe done design work, but we obviously have to often work with other
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.260]   designers and perhaps feed into that, maybe suggest changes as they do with us.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.300]   I mean, it's not like, you know, you have to be able to take that kind of to a very
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   less collaboration.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   It's not personal.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.100]   It's like, I think that's something that all designers need to learn is that it's like,
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.980]   because you do get quite attached to your work.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.020]   And when someone has constructive feedback, it's not personal.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.740]   And obviously, we all just want the best outcome for any project.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.220]   So can we shift the conversation a little bit about just the industry or career path
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.900]   that is everything to do with brand, you know, like, can you just help me understand like
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:06.820]   your path and journey to here, right, because, you know, most of the designers I work with
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.760]   are your, you know, design creatives, UI, UX type.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.020]   The skill set for brand is a little different, because there's a lot of strategy around that.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.740]   And I think I'm assuming a lot of that has to come with personal experience to be able
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.540]   to have a conversation on brand, because there's a lot of things that go beyond that, right?
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.940]   Like, you're looking at personas, you're looking at your audience, there's so much more to
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.940]   it.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.100]   So can you just help me understand like, your just your career path, like how did you what
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.100]   led you here?
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:37.660]   And like, what, when you decided to go to this branch, specifically of creative?
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.900]   I think, I think, like, we just touched upon earlier, I think this industry is kind of
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.020]   grown up quite a lot in the last, I'd say, it's been 15 years, I've probably been working
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.020]   in that.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.580]   Previous to that, after university, I ended up kind of working in logistics, just because
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.660]   that was the job I could get at the time, but actually, that I really am a strong believer
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.660]   in transferable skills.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.620]   And I think any job you have, you can glean, learn a lot if you have the kind of right
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.020]   mindset and take that on to many other roles in the future.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.020]   And I think in terms of kind of studio management, and project planning, and things like that,
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.900]   you know, logistics is great grounding, so that's unknowingly really helped.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:23.140]   But, but yeah, I think in the last 15 years, you know, our industry has kind of developed
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:28.100]   and, like I said, you know, there's roles there and there's processes there that have
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.700]   kind of really started to take shape.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.820]   And so I yeah.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:39.540]   So yeah, your journey has been kind of like, you went into logistics, you had a Sarah started
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.700]   a sandwich shop when she was like 19.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.260]   And then she's like, kind of went into a digital agency, and you've ended up in design and
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.260]   branding.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.260]   But mine was a lot more linear.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:54.340]   Like, I think at about the age of about 12, I did a logo for my friend's mum.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.420]   And I said I wanted to be a graphic designer.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.340]   I wasn't sure what a graphic designer was, but I just wanted to be a graphic designer.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.100]   So I like drawing, I like being on a computer.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.100]   So those two skills felt like they went together quite well.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:13.900]   So I studied art and IT, and went off to university, studied graphic design and became a graphic
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.800]   designer, worked at a couple of studios, and ended up here.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.500]   But I think I think it was the thing that kind of when we first started working together
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.260]   was with Creative Mornings.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.460]   I think I think as well, for me, it all started around content.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.900]   So I did my degree, then I studied again, and I studied on I kind of refocused in on
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.900]   literature and writing.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.900]   I love that side of things.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.140]   So and then I kind of started working in the design industry.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.140]   And I think for me, it's been really interesting to see how that kind of content and strategy
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:49.740]   piece has become more of a part, an official part, and an accepted part of branding, you
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:55.380]   know, and that kind of bringing meaning and, you know, reason for things and design decisions.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.260]   Because I do think that's where that that power comes from with branding.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.180]   And when you see really good branding, that's what it's all about.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:05.980]   So yeah, watching that kind of develop has been really interesting.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:11.500]   And I've worked in content and marketing, and again, I think I was I was watching one
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.420]   of your other podcasts where you're speaking to someone, it's like, is specialism better
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.420]   or generalism?
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.900]   And I think, you know, these roles have been crossing over for years.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.500]   And, and yeah, so my, my line hasn't been quite so straight, despite being around kind
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.860]   of design and web design and publishing for a really long time, but I think they do all
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.860]   feed into this process.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.980]   And I think I think that writing element, like you said, the manifesto, or the kind
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.180]   of the overarching, just it's a paragraph or a couple of paragraphs, but it distills
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.180]   that brand down.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:45.300]   Whenever Sarah writes that for a branding presentation, it always like gets me excited.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.860]   And I always insist that Sarah reads it out.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.820]   I do think it is so so powerful to set up.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:58.100]   I think when when, like, a big logo gets released in the media, like one over here, a little
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:05.180]   while back was the Olympics in 2012, they put it in the newspaper, and it just got slated.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.260]   Because I think when people don't understand the story behind it, they, the initial reaction
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.040]   is people don't like change, if like, Facebook changes its interface, nobody likes it.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:19.020]   But if through that presentation for the brand presentation we gave to you, and we always
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.580]   we always give to any brand that we've, we've been working with, once you kind of share
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.900]   that story, you share that message, and you share that kind of process thing where you've
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.580]   got to that logo, it's almost like letting people in on the joke, and then they get it.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.980]   And I think it just, it goes down so much better, and people just have a better understanding.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.420]   Yeah, I don't see it, I do, I do, I think you're right, it's letting people in on that,
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.740]   for sure, and being almost completely transparent in our thinking, but I think as well as that
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.700]   for me, and it's just being practiced, and I, I still like any creative thing, I'm sure
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.100]   you think every time, you don't always start a project going, "Oh my god, I'm gonna nail
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.100]   this straight away."
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.340]   You know, you always think, "Oh, this is hard," you know, but that's obviously the challenge
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:03.340]   of it, but it's just practice, you know, constantly looking and trying to glean, and what I feel
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.820]   like it's not letting people in on the joke, it's reflecting back every, as much as what
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:13.380]   they've shared with you as possible, and then making something really beautiful and useful
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:18.140]   off the back of that, really, so that's, it's like a reflect, I see that's what my job is,
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:24.140]   to reflect back, really, and, and puts it into some sort of sense for people to...
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.620]   It must be really interesting from your, from your end, kind of like, obviously, if you've
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.660]   got a brand, then you've got to then translate that for product, you've got to translate
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.780]   it for web, there's so many, like, once you've got that central hub of a brand, it's like
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.940]   so many areas for it to kind of, so many channels for it to go off on.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.940]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.940]   How do you find that?
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.660]   You know, so it's, it might look like my current job, and actually, the previous three, I would
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:54.940]   say, it would be similar, where the brand has been set, meaning there is a palette,
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:33:00.700]   there is the, there's the brand guidelines, they have all been set.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:08.540]   And in all three instances, I feel like the way the web reflects that brand was very limited.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:14.780]   So in, at Rubrik, for example, they had a really strong brand presence, the website
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.000]   just didn't do it justice.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.100]   So in that instance, we were able to do a complete redesign.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:24.380]   Not everyone has the has the luxury of doing a complete replatform.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:32.500]   My company after that at A10 Networks, that one, the brand felt a little more old school.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.940]   And that's where I was like, we didn't have budget to do a complete replatform or redesign.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:41.780]   And so the question was, what incremental changes can I make on a website to make it
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:47.580]   feel more relevant in a way that I feel like it should be that would engage audiences without
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.300]   it being a redesign or rehaul, right?
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.020]   And so that's looking at hero banners, and how can I maybe change that or when I'm looking
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.140]   at I, the first thing I changed was the icon language.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:04.220]   It's like, hard edges to round edges, you know, solid fill versus non, right?
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:09.840]   And, and the challenge with that one was not having the budget to execute at scale.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:18.620]   You have some, you have some mixes and matches of contrasting styles, but it was moving towards
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.620]   where I want to go.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.980]   And my current company, like Fortinet, we've got a great brand.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:30.420]   And the challenge from the website was the execution of it was a little limited.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:37.500]   And that is an example where a website for a company our size, you have to design with
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.420]   scale in mind from the get go.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.100]   And that leads itself to things like templates.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:51.540]   Well, the challenge is, if you go into it thinking templatization, and without a full
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.820]   view into the user experience, again, I wasn't there when the decisions were made, they're
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.580]   just just me reflecting on what I see and what I have to work with.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.740]   I feel the brand expression is limited.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:08.620]   And so you see, the full range of colors that is in our brand doesn't exist on .com.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:14.060]   We see the primary colors, you see some of the secondary, but the tertiary hardly exists.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.460]   And all the wonderful accent colors that are in a secondary palette just aren't there.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:25.620]   And so I think my, my challenge now is, how do I take what I believe to be an incremental
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:31.140]   approach and surgically go in and change things categorically.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.980]   And so I'm doing an exposition on all hero banners, and when it's done, it needs to roll
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.600]   out overnight.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.740]   And so there's, and then same thing with icons, like once I do it, it's great.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.160]   But now you have like, thousands of pages.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.740]   And then all of those in the icon library for web is a lot more expansive than typically
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.100]   what comms uses.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.140]   And so the work to recreate is pretty, pretty significant.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.260]   So those are things I'm looking at.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.620]   And we're making some, we're making some changes.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:04.140]   I'm, I'm a data nerd, so I'm testing things all the darn time.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.820]   And thank, and thankfully, the, the brand elements that we're testing in conjunction
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:16.140]   with different UI and UX layouts, it's, it's resulting in much higher conversion.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.020]   So that the challenge now is rolling that out at scale.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.300]   So yeah, that's, that's, that's kind of where we are.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:29.220]   I am hoping that just as a marketing person, like with the next year to two, I would love
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:33.540]   to see us do a brand update or refresh, you know, not moving too far from the center of
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.380]   who we are, but maybe just giving some more flexibility.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:42.180]   And I remember when I was at Rubrik, the, when we did that redesign, the first exercise
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:50.140]   was a, a, an exploration on who we were as an archetype for the company.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.620]   Are we a renegade company still?
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.780]   Are we a thought leader, right?
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.060]   Are, are we the friendly type?
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.940]   Right, there's all those archetypes.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.020]   And once you land on that, then we realize, oh, shoot, you know, as a brand for Rubrik,
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.940]   like in the beginning, they were renegades, they're, they're, they came out, guns a blazing,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.980]   and they're doing all these crazy fun things.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.660]   But now it's like, when I joined the company, it's like, they're a multi-million dollar
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.660]   company.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.700]   And like, now they have customers and they're, they can't go as intentionally crazy, even
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.300]   though like, like John, the, the VP of marketing, he had a brilliant creative mind.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.460]   But then like, now it's like the archetype for the company, it's a little different now,
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.460]   right?
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.900]   And now you're a leader and you as a leader, and that kind of, you guys actually came in
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.860]   around the same time because we did that redesign.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:41.620]   We also did Rubrik forward, you guys are hugely involved in like redesigning that whole look
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.500]   and approach, which is really, really cool to see your, your impact on that.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.900]   And I actually borrowed some of that for the website as well.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.260]   But yeah, that's just kind of like where I am on the client side of just, how do we do
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:58.260]   more with less in today's market, but also elevate the brand at the same time.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.020]   It sounds like a wise move, to be honest, because like all brands, they've got, they've
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.020]   got to keep evolving.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.540]   And then the business evolves.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:11.020]   And especially with businesses like Rubrik, it's so fast, isn't it?
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.020]   Like there is...
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.020]   Fast and fast.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.020]   Like a lot.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.020]   And it's moving really quickly.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.020]   And things do change.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:22.100]   You go from this like quirky little startup to, we, we, one of our big clients over the
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.140]   last few years, we did so much work with them.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.980]   They had their IPO and everything changed.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.500]   It was like they took everything in house, everything had to be safer.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.500]   And I get it.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.620]   They've got, they've got new goals, they've got new objectives to...
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.620]   New limitations as well.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.620]   When that comes, new limitations.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:46.060]   But I think what you're doing there with kind of just evolving the little things and, and
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.180]   especially on the web, testing them.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.100]   That's the tricky thing, isn't it?
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:57.420]   Is like keep making, you know, maturing like that and being very careful in a way, but
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:02.220]   also keeping that heart and that sort of core of who you are and, and at least communicating
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.220]   some personality.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.300]   Because if you're not careful, you can lose some of that personality, can't you?
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.620]   You're getting that big and, you know, things are getting really standardized.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.420]   It's quite hard, I think, to keep that personalization.
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.020]   But then you see some companies really leaning into it.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.740]   And like you'd think of Salesforce and Einstein and all the little characters they've got,
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.980]   they just, they lean in and people obviously love it and it's obviously very successful
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.980]   for them.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:33.580]   So yeah, it's, I suppose it's always a, it's always decisions to be made and you kind of
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.420]   start a brand new launch.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.260]   But at every, every year, every couple of months, there's avenues you can go down there
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.060]   where you can go safer or you can go down the adventurous route.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.300]   So yeah, brands are always going to keep moving and evolving.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.080]   But Rubrik is fascinating.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.560]   So like Odin Kilmer, so he's like the VP of design of product, I, I still, you know,
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   keep in touch with him.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.780]   And, you know, when I joined Rubrik, one of their decisions was, hey, like, from a branding
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.500]   point of view, we want our product to stand out.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.420]   And so when you look at it like a server rack, you see black, black, black, black, black,
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.020]   and you see white, like white as Rubrik, right?
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.780]   Actually, actually, funny enough, Fortinet's product is also white, our FortiGates, which
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.780]   is fantastic.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.980]   So, but what they realized was, you know, people are sitting in front of these screens,
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.260]   like they'd like the terminals every day.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:25.740]   And when you walk by the terminal, you don't know what product it is, because they all
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.420]   look the same, right, that the UI interface.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:34.900]   And so Odin came in, and he was like, when someone walks by this terminal, I want that
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.260]   software experience to be distinctly Rubrik.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.820]   And I remember in the very beginning, like he, he pulled me into the process, which was
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.820]   really fun.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.380]   I was like, oh, I felt like honored, right.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:52.380]   And yeah, we went through a mood board exercise and everything and putting on color.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.580]   And his takeaway was, they made a decision that they wanted the product experience to
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:05.260]   feel distinctly consumer, which is a huge departure from what most people see.
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.620]   So that was really, really cool.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:12.660]   And so now like, it changed their color palette, the uses of transparency versus not, and their
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:18.940]   their icon choices, and, and then also taking accessibility into consideration.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.220]   And you're looking at these screens for eight, 10 hours a day.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:26.940]   So you can't have colors are too bright, because it burns the brain.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.940]   So I think that's a good example.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.580]   Like you're taking your your brand, and you're executing it all the way down to product where
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:36.540]   sometimes like the brand feels like a marketing thing.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:40.780]   And it can be disjointed from product, and it was really cool seeing them do that.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.780]   I would actually love to see that in my current company.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:49.100]   And I think most companies in my, my B2B companies would probably agree with that, right?
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:53.140]   Like, you see all this cool stuff in marketing, how do we make the brand experience similar?
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.140]   Exactly.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.580]   That's the ideal of the aim, isn't it, is that kind of coherency, really, from every
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.340]   touch point, like you said, you know, whether it be customer service to kind of the actual
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:07.220]   product itself, you know, the online presence is socially tone voice, and that's the aim,
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.220]   isn't it?
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.460]   You know, this, like you say, it's always changing, there's no such thing as perfect.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.780]   So I think it's just all aiming for that, really, is the only way forward, otherwise
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:21.860]   it's terrifying, and petrified, you can't, you know, perfection doesn't exist.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:28.220]   So do you have any advice for someone who is maybe they're already a, they're a digital
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:35.220]   design or, or, or anything in the field, what would they need to think about to break into
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:41.060]   this industry more, or maybe catapult, catapult, you know, themselves, like, is there any advice
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.820]   you would give to somebody?
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:48.840]   I think, from from a, from a designer's point of view, if you're a young designer, a student
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.220]   or graduate, or somebody who's just looking to change their career completely, I think,
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.900]   I think, similar to what you did, I think share your work, I think the more you put
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:03.260]   out there, the more comes back, because if you're silent, then there's nothing for people
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.260]   to respond to.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.900]   So I think put your work out there, even if at the beginning, like, you're not thinking
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.900]   this is not strong enough.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.300]   And I think there's a lot of imposter syndrome in the creative industry, anyway, and people
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.300]   think this isn't good enough.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.820]   And you're almost comparing, there's a quote from Gavin Stranger's book, isn't it?
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.420]   It's like, don't compare your behind the scenes of other people's showreels.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.180]   And I always, I always kind of think about that a little bit, like, you see these perfectly
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.980]   curated kind of case studies and things, but, but share the process, share your work, and
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:37.580]   try and get out and meet fellow creatives at in-person events, or, and don't be afraid
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:43.340]   to reach out to people as well, because when people email us, asking for advice, we always,
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:48.220]   I think it is difficult to get back to lots of students and lots of people, we always
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:52.980]   try and get back with at least some help or maybe meet them for a coffee and try and,
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.900]   and try and offer, offer some feedback.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.900]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:00.540]   And I think from something I've kind of, we've learned in the years as well is maybe if you
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:05.700]   are currently working as a designer, or, you know, content strategist, or copywriter, what
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.700]   have you.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.340]   And I think sometimes you can be drawn to these sort of creative events, and you meet
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.100]   fellow creatives, which is really lovely and really important.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.260]   But I think sort of we've learned almost by accident really over the years is, if you're
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:23.460]   maybe interested in one sort of industry, or one cause, or what have you, you, I think
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.860]   there's something to be said for immersing yourself in that and actually learning about
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.500]   that and maybe offering some help in that area.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.740]   So for me, that was Creative Mornings, because I love seeing creatives kind of have room
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.900]   to play and create things and share that experience.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.380]   But maybe if it was, you know, for example, we've done work with sort of housing associations
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.780]   where, you know, it's a really quite gratifying work, because you're kind of helping build
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.900]   community and provide solutions for people.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:55.820]   And, you know, just thinking about it from an industry perspective, rather than thinking,
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.700]   right, I want to do the copywriting, it's like, what do you want to write about?
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.820]   And also, how can you make yourself useful?
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.860]   Because I think those then maybe case studies that are really quite powerful, and you get
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.100]   more work perhaps in that area as well.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:11.420]   I do think, yeah, if you if you put out tech work, there's probably going to be tech companies
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.420]   that get in touch with you.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:17.460]   If you put out food and drink brands, it's going to so so even if like, I think in the
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.580]   beginning, what a lot of people do is they build fictional brands to build a portfolio.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.980]   So it's put out what you want to come back.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:30.740]   I always remember when I was when I was young, when I was, I think I was a student, I did
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:35.780]   a drawing of Bob Dylan with like a super wavy curly hair, kind of inspired by the Milton
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.260]   Glazer kind of style a little bit.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.260]   And I posted it.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:43.260]   And I think I had about four inquiries from like, corporate companies asking me to draw
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:49.980]   their their C suite in that style, I've got doing a children's book illustrating a children's
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.980]   book in that style.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.340]   And it's just it's great, like it was just like a very quick doodle of Bob Dylan I put
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.020]   on Instagram, I think it was.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.940]   And yes, so just surprising what comes back when he puts it out there.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.460]   It's a really good example, actually, because I think as well, like thinking about different
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.460]   industry, but also think about style.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.620]   So maybe if you do want to work in a certain style, or write a certain, you know, put it
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.620]   out there.
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.620]   It comes back.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.340]   And yeah, I think that that's one thing I think we was trying to do, like, you know,
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.540]   working with Rubrik and other tech companies, I think sometimes you can go in thinking this
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.500]   is what they want the prescribes, sort of luck and feel of a tech company.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:29.660]   But I think what can be so gratifying for everybody involved is to actually do something
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.300]   completely different, especially if it's a campaign, so you've got a bit of artistic
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.300]   freedom.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.660]   And, and just, you know, bring something that you think would not fit in the tech space
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.300]   can just make those those campaigns.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:46.380]   If you do a Google search for cybersecurity, and go to Google Images, the things that will
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:52.420]   come up will be very dark images with flashing long exposure blue lights, like it'll be cables,
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:58.740]   they'll be kind of, it'll probably be like people in hoodies looking like hats and things
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.740]   like that.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.340]   Whereas I think our approach to Rubrik has been some of the Rubrik projects we've done
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.340]   have just been crazy.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:09.580]   Really, I think we worked on you with the review on the forward brand, where we kind
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:15.980]   of had that like, kind of arty kind of like, rig of like buildings in Chicago.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:22.280]   But we've recently just done a campaign with Rubrik, which they came to us, and it's illustrations
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.980]   all around characters that are kind of loosely based on Lord of the Rings characters.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.740]   And they're like drawn in this really kind of like graphically kind of style.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:34.620]   And it's so far removed from what you'd expect from cybersecurity.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:40.040]   So I think I think we've actually, when we first had John and Jane about six months in,
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.340]   we had we had a couple of staff at the time, and we sat down and we did a workshop of us
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.340]   for ourselves.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.780]   And what came out of it was, our mission was to do something different.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:54.180]   So when we get a project, look around what what the industry is currently doing, and
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:59.740]   what's expected in that industry, and try and take a different direction, which I think
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.980]   that's when a company gets out of their comfort zone.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.220]   That's when you get out of your comfort zone, and you can experiment and try new things.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:09.740]   And I think that's when the most interesting things happen as well, from a creative point
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.740]   of view.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:11.740]   Yeah, I agree with all of that.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.940]   You know, I think, to add on top of that great advice, I think my takeaway is as a creative,
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:23.620]   you know, if you discover an industry or an area that you're passionate about, allow yourself
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:28.340]   to pour into it, and then showcase that work, right, and hopefully that work is showcased
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.660]   in a way that shows kind of the diversity of skill sets, because obviously, that's what's
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.740]   going to get the attention first.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:39.340]   I think when it comes to the interview process, or actually even utilizing social, that part
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.620]   that I don't think it's talked about enough, which is like, when I'm making a hire for
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:45.380]   design creatives, I like how Zoom just did a thumbs up there.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:49.500]   I don't know who in product chose to do that.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:55.780]   So the process of how you align or arrive at the end, it becomes really, really important,
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.780]   right?
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.740]   Because there's a difference between someone who just gets instruction, and just output
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.620]   something, and the output can be fantastic, or misses the mark, but if they understand
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:13.580]   your process on how you receive a instruction, and then you turn that into something, like
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.840]   the questions that you're asking, the things you're deliberating over, as you approach
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.540]   to the final design, that is really, really important.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:27.820]   It's a difference between an end result that is a very solid and bold and color, or something
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:32.780]   that looks really flashy and trendy, or something very conservative, like understanding how
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.540]   you make decisions to arrive there, and your interview process helps them understand if
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:42.220]   you're going to join the company, you're going to provide a little more perspective before
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.220]   the end result, right?
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:48.260]   I think that's something that in a world of social, I wish people would do more of that,
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:52.540]   you know, like, here's the behind the scenes on how I approached this project or problem,
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:58.400]   or here's where we started, and it's something very, very different, and here's why, right?
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.460]   Or even like, breaking down like, hey, if it's an exercise in type font, even helping
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:11.120]   people understanding the thickness versus the thinness of a font, or how smooth or how
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:16.740]   hard it is, and how that ties into a decision on brand, helping people understand that is
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:17.740]   really, really important.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.700]   And I think with things like LinkedIn, where there's like, there's like video mediums to
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.700]   do that.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.480]   And again, if you're trying to get yourself out there, don't limit yourself to just the
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.020]   work you produced.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.140]   I think the method is really, really important.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.140]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:36.100]   And sometimes it is sometimes just getting out there as well.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.860]   And if you're, if you're looking at your own brand, for example, and you look at some of
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.780]   the biggest companies in the world, some of the biggest social media companies, like Twitter,
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:50.140]   if you look, even Apple, if you look back at their original logo, it's like, unrecognizable
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.900]   to where they, because like we said, brands have to evolve.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.580]   And yeah, I think, I think putting yourself out there is, it does take a bit of bravery
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:04.660]   and a bit of vulnerability as well, but I think it's, I think it's worth it.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.660]   Cool.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.660]   Sarah, Gareth, it was great having you on.
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.440]   It was really enjoyable conversation, but hoping you can come back again, you know,
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:14.860]   we need to talk about your, that your, your passion on t-shirts for soccer, football, but
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:23.380]   actually I have one last fun question I was asking you, I intentionally didn't prepare
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.380]   you for this.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.620]   Cause I'm just kind of curious.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.220]   So you're, you mentioned earlier, you're a small company, but you're working with your
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.340]   spouse or partner.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:33.340]   What is that like?
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.060]   Cause like, I like when I have a hard day at work, I try not to take that home with
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.700]   me, but you guys are living it together.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.700]   Right?
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.580]   Like, so what does that look like?
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:50.260]   I think, I think we literally share your amusement about it because we never started this seven
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.700]   years ago thinking, oh yeah, we'll be doing this for a good 10 years now.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.220]   Well, let's do it as long as we can do it and then like chill out and not do that and
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:02.100]   go and get a job somewhere else because obviously those boundaries are really, really important.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:07.420]   So I'd say that's obviously where it's tricky because obviously a lot of us bring our work
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.620]   home at night, but obviously cause we're both across all the work, it's really easy to just
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.540]   talk about work all the time.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.380]   But I think, you know, on the other hand, you know, on the plus side that there is that
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.700]   kind of working relationship that has been about, you know, nearly a decade.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:29.420]   So it's when we do present and when projects do go really well and, you know, that can
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.460]   be really, really sort of lovely thing to share actually.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:39.100]   It's like, I think, I think just like in work when you have a big win, it's a big win as
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.100]   well.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.100]   I do think there is, there has to be a line.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.860]   We, we, we often refer to ourselves in third person and it's like, we call it Gareth and
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:54.380]   Sarah and John and Jane, but I think we have to like, make sure we kind of get that, that
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.380]   separation there.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.700]   And, and I think this, there's certainly things that help, like we've got a dog and we get,
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:05.460]   we take the dog for a big walk every single day and just, just making sure you do the
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:10.340]   basic things as well, like go, go and do some exercise and do yoga and things like that.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.260]   I think like with colleagues it's really, really key, isn't it, that you do have maybe
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:18.020]   some honest conversations sometimes, but I think perhaps working in this scenario, I
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:22.860]   think you have to do that by times a hundred, you have to be honest and you have to like,
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.060]   you know, because it's, it is otherwise can be quite intense.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:30.220]   There's no, no point and you can't just let things build up because, you know, there's
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.220]   work to do.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:38.820]   You've got to kind of keep on top of that and, and yeah, I think, yeah, it is a tricky,
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:39.820]   tricky one.
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.900]   And I think a lot of people like friends and family, they're all kind of like, how are
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.900]   you doing?
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   But I don't know.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:51.380]   It is a nature as well, I think, cause like my daughter, like with Create the Mornings,
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:55.900]   you know, we work together there, there'll be family members coming in to help and actually
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.900]   we really enjoy that.
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.700]   I know they say never work with your family or your friends even, but actually in our
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.100]   experience, that's always been really, really nice, isn't it?
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.100]   So far.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.100]   So far.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.100]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.660]   Brothers come in and children and you know, everyone has something to offer, don't they?
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.680]   And I think those people that are closest to you, you know, you experience, I'm sure like
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:19.260]   when you share your work things and your problems, they've got that unique take on it cause they
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.260]   know you so well.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.260]   So yeah, they can be helpful.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:24.260]   Do you think you can do it too?
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.540]   Oh man, it's, it's tough.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.160]   I probably could.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:38.500]   My wife is pretty fantastic and I think knowing when to relinquish a control or a decision
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:45.720]   and I think being able to have humility and swallow pride where it's needed and pick and
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:50.800]   choose when you need to really argue for your point of view versus knowing when to let something
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:55.880]   go is probably, would probably be the hardest part, especially if you're, if you're each
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.680]   individually really strong in your points of view.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:01.680]   Someone has a give and take.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:07.140]   But I think the part about walking the dog, like having a break point and then like work
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.620]   is now over.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:12.320]   Now we're going to, no longer John and Jane, we're Susan and Gareth, right?
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.480]   I tell you, actually one straight line we do have that's really clear and has always
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:22.400]   been the case is when it goes to creative and visuals, you have final say and when it
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:27.600]   comes to maybe a strapline or the messaging, I have final say, so they're in a line in
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   the middle.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:35.160]   So it's like, we can obviously feed into it, both of us, but the decision, if we are having
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.240]   an argument is yours or mine in most places.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   I think it's good.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.160]   You need to agree on how the tiebreaker is going to happen, right?
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.420]   I think it'd be way more difficult if we were both designers.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.920]   I think when I was in university, I thought one day I'll start my own business with one
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.340]   of my designer friends.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.960]   I think that would be hell.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.440]   I just choose designers with strong opinions, kind of trying to figure something out.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:06.720]   At least Sarah and I, our skill sets complement one another other than the same skillset going
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.400]   head to head.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   So there's it is.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.320]   So whoever's listening, you guys need some help for branding or having a digital agency.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.960]   Like I totally recommend John and Jane.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.220]   How can they find you guys?
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.640]   Your website or what have you?
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.880]   Yeah, the best place to find us would be johnandjane.agency.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.720]   And we're probably most active on Instagram and LinkedIn, the two kind of platforms that
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.720]   we've...
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.720]   I think you've got to pick your battles when you're small.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:35.200]   So I think they're the two that we've got on our social platforms.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.560]   And Instagram, is it also just John and Jane?
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   Or...
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   It's actually...
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   Because our logo kind of looks like a name, we couldn't get John and Jane.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.360]   So for them, I think it is John and number eight, Jane.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.360]   John and Jane.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   Cool.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.480]   Well, thanks, guys, for being on the episode and hopefully we'll be talking again soon.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.240]   Thanks so much for having us, Tim.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.240]   Thanks so much, Tim.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:54.240]   Cheers.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:54.980]   See you.
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:55.480]   Bye.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.060]   (upbeat music)
