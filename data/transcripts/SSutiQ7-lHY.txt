[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.000]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the third chapter, reading again from verse 9 to the
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.800]   end of verse 13. The third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, reading from
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:29.080]   verse 9 to verse 13. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Jesus
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.520]   answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:45.720]   verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.400]   ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.280]   shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.000]   but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Now this, as you realize from the reading, is a part of the account which we are given
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.880]   here of this extraordinary interview that took place between our blessed Lord and Savior
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.400]   and this Master of Israel, this great Teacher of Israel, whose name was Nicodemus. Those
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.760]   who attend here regularly will remember how we have been dealing with this incident now
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:38.520]   for a great many weeks, indeed two or three months, because it is one of these crucial
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.040]   portions of teaching that we have in the New Testament. Let me explain again what we are
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.480]   doing. We are working our way through this gospel according to St. John, not in detail,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.680]   but we are concerned to examine its teaching from one particular standpoint, and that is
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:07.120]   this. The great message of this gospel is about life, eternal life. That is its leading
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.320]   theme. It is put, as we have been seeing in the first chapter in the 16th verse, in this
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:22.880]   great word, "And of his fullness of all we receive, and grace upon grace." Now that
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.320]   is the great message of this gospel. To be Christian means to receive of the fullness
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.400]   of the Lord Jesus Christ, nothing less than that. It is merely an intellectual belief.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.560]   It is merely being forgiven even, vital, essential though that is. Christianity really means
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.000]   the life of God in the souls of men. And that is the theme. It is put in so many different
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.800]   terms right away through this great gospel. Here it is again in one of those great resounding
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.640]   phrases, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.120]   Now that is the great theme of the gospel. It is, I say, the great message of the Christian
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.760]   faith. And we are examining the gospel in terms of that particular teaching. And we
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.360]   have seen that it is presented to us in many ways. In that great prologue in the first
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.280]   eighteen verses of that first chapter, we have the theme set before us. Then John the
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.500]   Baptist's testimony comes and he enforces it. He says, "I indeed baptize with water,
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.920]   he shall baptize with the Holy Ghost." There is the contrast again. And then we have seen
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.640]   how, as you go on, this same theme is illustrated in different ways. Even the marriage feast
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.600]   at Cana of Galilee, it shows it. Our Lord there in a dramatic manner, in working a miracle,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.080]   which is at the same time a parable, makes this selfsame point that there is a superabundance
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.520]   available when he acts. It astonishes everybody. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.240]   water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was, the governor of the feast called the
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.360]   bridegroom and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.240]   when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.840]   until now. Now that's it. And we've gone on examining it in different ways. But now
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.200]   here, in the case of this man Nicodemus, what we really have presented to us is one of the
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:46.920]   great obstacles to the receiving of this life, perhaps the greatest obstacle of all. And
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.680]   it was in his dealings with this man that our Lord pinpoints this particular difficulty
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.400]   and gives us an exposition of his teaching with respect to it. And he does it, of course,
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.480]   as you remember, by interrupting what Nicodemus was about to say to him, by looking at him
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:16.040]   and saying, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot even
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:25.120]   see the kingdom of God, leave alone enter it. A rebirth is absolutely essential. And
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.880]   what we've been doing is to note the marks and the characteristics of the new birth,
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.480]   in order that we may know for certain whether we are truly Christian or not. The Bible exalts
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.240]   us to examine ourselves, to prove our own selves, whether we are in the faith or not.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.160]   It's possible for a man to imagine he's a Christian without being one. There is much
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.880]   teaching about that. So we've been looking at the characteristics or the manifestations,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.000]   if you like, of this new life from God in the souls of men, which result from the new
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.560]   birth, the regeneration. And it is essential that we should do that. And we've been doing
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.280]   so in terms of the great statement, the illustration that our Lord himself has used, "The wind
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.600]   bloweth where it listeth." Now hear us the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.520]   cometh nor whither it goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit. You see the effects,
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.920]   the results, and we've been examining them and looking at them. But now the record takes
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.000]   us further and beyond that. Nicodemus is still in trouble. Nicodemus answered and said unto
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.200]   him, "How can these things be?" Now our Lord deals with that. He answers that, and that's
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.920]   the thing that's occupying us this morning. I want to put it to you like this. This was
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.040]   the thing that prevented Nicodemus from entering into the life at all, as it prevents so many
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.160]   still from ever becoming Christian at all. This is the great obstacle. But I'm concerned
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:17.800]   to show and to emphasize that it is also at the same time, it seems to me, the chief hindrance
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:28.600]   in Christian people themselves from receiving of his fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.040]   My dear friends, look at it like this. Take the descriptions given of the Christian men
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.880]   and the possibilities for the Christian men while he is still in this world of time in
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:47.680]   the New Testament, and examine yourself in the light of that. We are offered the exceeding
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:56.840]   riches of God's grace. We are offered the unsearchable riches of Christ. We are told
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.280]   that we can be filled with the fullness of God. That's what's offered to us and held
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.520]   out before us. That is what we are meant to be as Christian people. And then I said let's
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:18.440]   examine ourselves. Do we correspond to that? Are we like that? Now then, if not, I say
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   one of the main causes is the very thing that stumbled Nicodemus. There is an adversary,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.400]   there is an enemy, who is always trying to stand between us and the receiving of his
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.320]   fullness and grace upon grace. And the weapon that he uses most frequently, it seems to
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:44.040]   me, is the very one that he used here in the case of Nicodemus. What is it? Well, let me
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.880]   put it as a principle to you. The supreme hindrance to our receiving the fullness of
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:09:00.320]   this life is pride of intellect and confidence in understanding. That is the greatest enemy
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.760]   in these spiritual matters from beginning to end. And the fact that we may be converted
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.000]   and are Christians does not mean that we finished with that particular problem. It's a problem
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.960]   that dogs our footsteps all the way through. You get illustrations of that even in the
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.840]   New Testament itself. The Apostle Paul has to write his epistle to the Galatians in a
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.560]   sense simply to deal with this. He says, "Having started in the spirit, are you going to go
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.840]   on in the flesh?" It was the same trouble in the church at Corinth. It keeps on creeping
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.720]   in. It's been the enemy that has dug the footsteps of Christian people throughout the
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   running centuries. There is always a tendency to fall back on works of human ability and
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:50.240]   understanding. So I laid down as a proposition that the supreme hindrance to our receiving
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.600]   of his fullness and grace upon grace is this pride of intellect, confidence in understanding.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:07.760]   Now, this of course has already been put before us by our Lord's insistence upon the new birth.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:15.560]   It's implicit in the teaching about the new birth. If it is essential, as he says it is,
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:22.120]   we must be born again. Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:30.320]   into the kingdom of God. Now, it's implicit in that the fact that a man must be born again
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.020]   is in itself sufficient to prove that as he is, and with all his powers and propensities,
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:43.760]   he can never enter into the kingdom of God. But now here our Lord puts it explicitly,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:50.240]   and that is the particular and peculiar value of these few verses that we are looking at
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.720]   together this morning. The thing was implicit before, but now our Lord opens it out, makes
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:02.880]   it plain, perfectly clear, explicit. What is this difficulty? Well, let's put it like
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:13.280]   this. It is this desire that is within us always to understand how can these things
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:20.040]   be. That's the difficulty. The man of the world comes into a Christian church, hears
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.360]   an exposition of the scripture, and he's bewildered, he's baffled. Why? Well, because
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.120]   it's totally unlike everything he's ever heard before, everything that is outside.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.200]   It's odd, it's mysterious, it's unusual. And he's troubled because he can't understand,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:44.160]   but he wants to understand. Men by nature always wants to understand. The third chapter
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   of the book of Genesis tells us that that was the first sin, it is indeed the original
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:58.440]   sin. Man wants to be as God, and the devil tempts him along that line. As God said, don't
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.840]   listen to him, says the devil, if you eat of this fruit, you will be as God's and you'll
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.660]   understand everything. And man wants to understand everything. He starts with that. This is innate
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:16.720]   within him, this desire for full comprehension and understanding of everything. Well, then
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.280]   of course, it leads to the next step, which is this, that he says he won't believe anything
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   unless he can understand it. That's the next step. You see, if you start by saying that
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.440]   you must have understanding, well, then you're quite logical in saying that you won't believe
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:40.200]   anything unless you can understand it and comprehend it. And that, as you know, is the
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.440]   common position and argument put forward by the man who's not a Christian at all, the
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.760]   humanist and others. I'm not going to believe a thing unless I understand it. Now, I'm not
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.360]   going to waste your time this morning in refuting that particular argument. I've often done
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   so in a more evangelistic kind of service. It's not my business to do that this morning.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.720]   Let me just say this, therefore, in passing. The man who takes that position is not only
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.080]   being foolish, he's being utterly inconsistent with himself. Let me use the argument I've
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:18.200]   often used. Do you understand electricity? And the answer is you don't. The greatest
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.960]   scientist doesn't understand electricity, but he uses it, doesn't he? He's prepared
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.200]   to use it, though he doesn't understand it. He's prepared to harness its effects and its
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.480]   results, though he doesn't understand the thing itself. Now, to be logical, he should
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.680]   never use electricity because he doesn't understand it. But you see, that is a part of the inconsistency
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:46.960]   of unbelief and of sin at all times. But it tends, I say, to follow us even into the Christian
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:53.120]   life itself. And there is this perpetual desire to understand. And it works out next in this
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:01.240]   form. And this is where it becomes most serious. The next step, then, is to limit the truth
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:11.080]   of God to the measure of our understanding. And so, when we come even to the gospel and
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.680]   say that we believe it, we believe in God, we believe in salvation, in Jesus Christ,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:23.720]   but now we tend to put our limits upon what that means. And to me, this is the greatest
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:31.760]   sin, perhaps, in the Christian church at the present time. We reduce this infinite, glorious,
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:41.680]   everlasting gospel to the measure of our understanding. We do so in so many different ways. We do
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.360]   so even in our very definitions, in our outlining of what truth is. This is the common thing
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:54.000]   at the present time. The moment you put the authority of the Bible on one side and refuse
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.240]   to submit to revelation, but say that that is truth only, which you can understand and
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.040]   comprehend, you are guilty of this very thing. And that is what is being done today. Men
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.480]   are no longer governed by the scriptures. They sit in judgment upon it. They say, "This
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.620]   is right, that isn't right." Revelation is no longer the authority. What is the authority?
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:22.160]   Men's understanding. Philosophy. And philosophy is nothing but men's human understanding.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:29.440]   And that is the tragedy today. That the gospel, this glorious gospel, is being limited to
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:36.320]   the measure of man's mind and comprehension. They throw out the miraculous and supernatural.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.120]   They say, "The modern scientific men can't possibly believe this." Out it goes. Now,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:47.800]   this is happening even amongst those who are in the Church. The glory of the gospel is
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:57.560]   being limited and lowered and narrowed to the measure of men's understanding. And this,
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:04.720]   I say, is the greatest hindrance, I think, probably of all the hindrances, to our receiving
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.880]   of his fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.200]   What's your view and mine of the Christian life this morning? Far too often it's just
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.760]   this, isn't it? "Oh, yes, we say we believed in Jesus Christ to conversion. We took our
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:25.000]   decision. We accepted him." And from then on, you've just gone on, you rely upon that,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.120]   and you stop doing certain things, you begin to do others. And you've got it all nice
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.920]   and complete, and you do your duties, and you may be active in work, and there you are,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.640]   you're complete, you're self-contained, and you think that that is Christianity. But,
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:48.520]   my dear friends, is it Christianity? Have we received of his fullness and grace upon
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:56.160]   added to, built upon grace, ever expanding, until we know something of the fullness of
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.960]   God himself? I feel that this has been the great trouble, perhaps, in this present century,
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.720]   and I'm talking to evangelical people in particular. I feel we have made the gospel
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:14.320]   something small, sometimes something even glib, something that we handle, and we are
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:22.960]   afraid of yielding ourselves to the possibilities that are here put before us in the New Testament
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:30.920]   scriptures. Now, this, you see, is something which is quite fatal, this limiting of the
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.840]   gospel to the level of our understanding and comprehension. There is a danger that many
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.480]   today are even interpreting the scriptures in terms of their little experience, instead
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.040]   of judging their experience by the teaching of the scriptures. There are people who are
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.120]   afraid of the Holy Spirit and his power, because they don't know anything about it. And because
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.880]   they haven't experienced it, they would even limit the teaching of the scripture. It's
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.080]   all interpreted in terms of their own understanding. It's nice and neat. Nothing unusual must happen.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   They're afraid, as it were, of the breaking in of the supernatural. Here is the great
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.080]   danger, the greatest, perhaps, of all the dangers. And it is a danger that is exposed
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.560]   and denounced in the New Testament. Here it is here. Our Lord does it with Nicodemus.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.920]   It's the very heart of his message to him. But he did it in many other places. Listen
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.000]   to this, at the end of the eleventh chapter of Matthew's gospel. Our Lord breaks out
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.520]   into prayer and says, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:45.440]   these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes, even so, Father,
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.720]   for so it seemed good in thy sight." There it is, once and forever. Wise and prudent,
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:19:00.520]   people with understanding. It's hidden from them. It's revealed unto babes. And the apostle
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.200]   Paul, of course, giant intellect as he was, he keeps on making the same thing. You remember
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.800]   how he puts it so clearly at the end of his first chapter, of his first epistle to the
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.160]   Corinthians, "You see, O calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh,
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.560]   not many mighty, not many noble, are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.720]   the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.600]   the things which are mighty, etc." And there it is again in the second chapter in verse
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.680]   14, "The natural men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:44.800]   unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." Well, here
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.080]   it is, you see, and yet people seem to fail to grasp this and to understand this. How
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.840]   can these things be? I can't understand this. I can't follow this. And because they can't,
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:20:00.200]   they hold back, and they limit the possibilities of grace and of glory.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:06.800]   But let me, therefore, in expounding our Lord's teaching to Nicodemus, show you in the second
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:16.840]   place the folly of this, as well as its utter uselessness. The folly of trusting to human
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:25.520]   wisdom and wanting to understand. Our Lord ridicules it here in handling Nicodemus. And
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:32.280]   you remember the way in which he puts it. He puts it to him like this. He says, "If
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.600]   I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe? How can you believe
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.960]   if I should tell you of heavenly things?" But before that, he's reprimanded him. "Art
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:57.980]   thou a master of Israel, a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things? If I have told
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:04.000]   you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe? How can you possibly believe
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.280]   if I tell you of heavenly things?" What does this mean?
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:15.480]   Now, my friends, here I feel is the message to so many of us at this present time. The
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.720]   utter folly of trusting to this understanding. How can these things be? Always putting that
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.060]   question, "I'm not going to believe unless I understand." Oh, the folly, the tragedy
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:31.400]   of this. This is the curse of men. This is why the world is as it is this morning. It
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.520]   is rejecting God and his teaching and his government because it feels it understands.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:43.880]   And you see the chaos that results as it came in at the fall and men's original disobedience.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.560]   It's just a repetition of that. Now, the folly, I say, can be shown in this way that men really
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.480]   cannot understand earthly things. What does he mean by that? "If I have told you earthly
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.720]   things and ye believe not." Well, he's undoubtedly referring to what he's just been saying and
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:05.200]   what he's just been doing. And what that was, as I say, the illustration about the wind.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.520]   He's just put it bluntly to Nicodemus by saying, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, accept a
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.120]   man and be born again." Then he repeats it, "You must be born of water and of the Spirit."
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   Nicodemus is baffled. "Well, very well," says our Lord, "listen." It's like this. The wind.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:31.600]   You hear the sound of the wind. You can't see it. You don't understand it. It's the rules
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   that govern it. But you hear the sound. You see the effects and the results. You see the
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   clothes playing, flapping on the line. You see the branches of the trees swaying. The
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.960]   wind. You see the effects and the results. You don't understand what's happening or how
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:54.880]   it's produced. But you see in the manifestations and the result, and you're content with it,
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.800]   and you use it, and you employ it. Well, now, what I'm talking about is like that. There is
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.120]   a mystery about it, but you see the effects and the results. But Nicodemus still doesn't
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:14.240]   understand. He still goes on saying, "How can these things be?" So our Lord puts it like that
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.720]   to me, says, "You can't even understand earthly things as I've put them to you." And being
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:28.760]   interpreted, you see, that means this. That we are incapable of really understanding what we see
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   are the workings of the gospel in human life, in the life of this world. These things have
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.360]   been prophesied in the Old Testament. Our Lord reprimands Nicodemus for that reason. He says,
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.720]   "You are a master of Israel. You ought to know these things. Haven't you read your prophets?
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:58.840]   They have said that when the new age comes, the lame men shall leap as the heart, the blind shall
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:04.920]   be unable to see, the deaf to hear. The new age that is coming and the spirit is going to be
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.080]   poured out. There's the teaching. Are you ignorant of all that? But you've got that in your scriptures.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:16.400]   These are earthly things. As a Jew, you should have been prepared for this kind of thing. Don't
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.640]   you see? Don't you understand? You've noticed me. You've noticed my power to work miracles.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.800]   You've expressed your amazement at my teaching. You've come to the conclusion that I must be a
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.320]   teacher sent from God. Well, then why don't you listen to me? Why don't you follow out your own
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:37.000]   logic? Why are you still baffled?" Now, that's what's meant by earthly things. And, of course,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:47.120]   that is equally applicable to us at the present time. No one can understand the facts of Christian
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:55.240]   history. They're there. They're quite definite. The lives of the saints, the greatest benefactors
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.760]   the world has ever known, the amazing things that have happened to them, the astounding things
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.400]   they've been enabled to do. These are earthly things. They belong solidly to history. Can
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.440]   anybody understand them? They can't. The wise people of today, they don't understand these
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:17.440]   things. They don't understand the single individual Christian. Now, in this present century of ours,
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.480]   they've been making great efforts to do this. Psychology, with its analysis, it claimed at
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.840]   first it was going to explain everything. And it tries to explain the Christian man,
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:32.360]   but it cannot. It's totally inadequate. I hope to elaborate on that perhaps this evening. But
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:40.280]   here it is. Now, the apostle again has put this very clearly in 1 Corinthians 2.15, where he says,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:46.480]   "He that is spiritual judgeth all things." He means by that, the man who is born again,
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:52.120]   the man who has the Spirit within him, he has an understanding of these matters. "He that is
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:26:01.600]   spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man." That means that when a man is
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:07.880]   born again and becomes a Christian, has the Spirit in him, he's got an understanding, but other people
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:15.600]   can't understand him. And they can't. The Christian, the true Christian, is an enigma and a problem to
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.280]   everybody who is not Christian. And this again, of course, is one of the best tests we can ever
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:26.560]   apply to ourselves. If people can understand you, my friend, in total, you are just not a Christian.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:35.920]   The Christian is a mystery. The Christian is an enigma. He must be. You can't have the life of
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:42.040]   God put into you and remain as you were. You become strange. There's a difference. There's
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.600]   something that's happened. "How can these things be?" they say. They don't understand you. You're
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.760]   a human being. You're earthly as it were. You're concrete. You're standing before them. They see
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.800]   what's happened to you. They see what you are. They don't understand. They don't understand these earthly
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   things. And that is the whole position with the world this morning. And the tragedy is that you
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:12.560]   and I tend to bring that even into the realm of the Christian life. Unless we have full understanding,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.480]   unless we can handle it, as it were, we're not prepared to believe. And we're not prepared to
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:25.040]   yield ourselves. And so we put our limits upon God's blessing to us and the possibilities of
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:31.600]   grace. But let's go on to the bigger argument that our Lord uses. "If I have told you earthly
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.440]   things and ye believe not," here's the question, "how can you possibly believe if I tell you
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:45.840]   heavenly things?" What are these? "Now then, here are the things, my dear friend, that you and I
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.280]   need to spend more time in contemplating and in considering." What are they? Well, he puts it like
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:59.200]   this, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man,
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:08.480]   which is in heaven." These are the heavenly things. Look here, Nicodemus says, "Our Lord,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.560]   to this great teacher, give up this attempt to understand men. When I've come down to your level
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.720]   and have used a human, earthly illustration, you still can't follow. Well, then do you think you
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.960]   can possibly understand if I begin to tell you about the other things, the upper limits and
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:30.920]   reaches of this great salvation that I've come to bring? Men, see at once that it's utter folly.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:39.280]   Give it up. Stop." And I feel that that is what he's saying to us this morning, the heavenly
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:47.640]   things. What's he talking about? Well, here are some of these heavenly things. They're revealed
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:29:03.160]   in the Scriptures. The blessed Holy Trinity, God in three persons, blessed Trinity. Heavenly things,
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:12.400]   what is the teaching? Well, here is the teaching concerning the heavenly things, three persons. Yet
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:24.760]   only one God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Think of the glory of God, if you can. This is what
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:31.360]   we are concerned about. This is what Christianity is. Christianity, you know, is not just being nice
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.960]   and good and moral, and a little bit better than obvious sinners. It's not expressing your opinions
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.600]   on the current political problems of the day. Those are earthly things. The content of this,
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:51.000]   the real basis of this, the real essence of this, is the heavenly things. What is Christianity? Well,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.400]   Christianity is that which brings a man to a knowledge of God. Take our Lord's own definition
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:04.800]   of life eternal. This is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:11.280]   Christ whom Thou hast sent. That's Christianity. Knowing God, not just believing a few things about
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:17.600]   God and living a nice little life, that's not Christianity. That's often nothing but morality
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:24.760]   or mere religion. The essence of this is entering into this realm in which you begin to know and
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:32.800]   have communion with the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Where's your understanding now?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.400]   Are you still saying, "How can these things be? I can't understand three persons and one God." Of
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.640]   course you can't. Are you ever fool enough to think that you could or that anybody else could?
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:50.440]   That's what our Lord is ridiculing. You finite little person who can't understand yourself and
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.600]   can't understand phenomena that are around and about you. Are you going to try to measure the
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:04.640]   illimitable and eternal and everlasting God? God who is from everlasting to everlasting without
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:11.720]   beginning or end. Understand? Are you mad enough to bring such a term into this realm? Now these
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:20.000]   are the heavenly things. Or try to think about the glory of God and the glory of heaven. I read
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.560]   to you at the beginning that portion out of the sixth chapter of the book of the Prophet Isaiah,
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:30.960]   because there we get a glimpse of it. Isaiah was a very great and a very able man. But being called
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.320]   to his great task and mission, he is given just a glimpse into the glory. And you remember what
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.440]   happened? The glory of God and the posts of the door begin to shake and the place is filled with
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.640]   smirk. And he feels completely shattered and undone. He hasn't seen God. He's only had a
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:56.600]   glimpse of him as it were, in the distance. And his reaction is, "Woe is unto me. For I am a man
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:04.640]   of unclean lips. And I dwell amongst a people of unclean lips." He didn't say, "What is happening?
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.200]   What is this phenomenon? How can these things be? Can I understand this scientifically? What?" He
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:15.440]   doesn't think of such things. He's not mad enough to do so. It's the glory of God. And he's humbled
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:25.240]   to the ground and to the dust. Oh, my dear friends, this is Christianity. Not something that
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:31.040]   you and I can have in a neat little packet, in which we can explain everything and in which we
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.200]   are controlling everything. Do you want to know something about these heavenly things? Oh, it's
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.040]   when you and I and all Christians are lifted up into this realm, that God will begin to smile
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.760]   upon us and to use us. And we shall see this old world shaken again in a great revival. This is the
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.680]   need. But you and I have got to stop this understanding and limiting. Listen to it. This
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:33:01.640]   is the sort of thing I'm talking about. "It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:08.760]   come to visions and revelations of the Lord." 2 Corinthians chapter 12. "I knew a man in Christ
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.480]   above fourteen years ago, whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:23.760]   tell, God knoweth. Such an one caught up into the third heaven. And I knew such a man whether in
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.280]   the body or out of the body I cannot tell." The little understanding has been dropped, you see.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:34.160]   Cannot tell, of course he can't tell. He doesn't ask how can these things be. It's happening. It's
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.920]   taking place. He's there. He's lifted up. He doesn't understand, God knoweth, how that he
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:47.000]   was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.680]   "Of such a one will I glory, yet of myself I will not glory but in mine infirmities."
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:02.440]   That's a glimpse of the heavenly things, my friends. Do we know anything about these things?
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:08.520]   Have you got your Christianity taped? Can you explain everything? Is it just the little system
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:14.920]   that you've worked out? Oh, God have mercy upon us. This is it. Not of necessity that we shall all
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.760]   be given that privileged experience of the great apostle, but in a measure it is open to all of us.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:31.320]   Lifted up into this realm which is entirely beyond all human understanding. Listen to it again as
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.600]   it's put in the book of Revelation. "After this I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven,
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.440]   and the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said,
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   'Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be thereafter.' And immediately I
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:55.240]   was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne, and he that
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:01.160]   sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone, and there was a rainbow round about the
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.480]   throne in sight like unto an emerald, and round about the throne were four and twenty seats,
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.440]   and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment, and they had
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:17.880]   on their heads crowns of gold, and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunders and
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:23.960]   voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:29.280]   God, and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto a crystal, and in the midst of
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:35.400]   the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and so on,
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:40.920]   and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him, and they were full of eyes within,
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:49.680]   and they rest not day and night saying, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty which
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:36:01.560]   was and is and which is to come.'" That's Christianity, knowing something about these
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:15.680]   heavenly things, being in the presence of God, realizing God. Can't you see the utter futility,
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:22.280]   the fatuity of asking your foolish little question, "How can these things be? I don't
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:28.360]   understand. I don't know that realm. I'm afraid." Oh, my dear friend, listen to our Lord's teaching
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:34.880]   to Nicodemus. Drop your petty little understanding. It can't even understand earthly things, still
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:42.680]   less these heavenly things. Can you understand the whole scheme and plan and purpose of redemption?
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   That's what you find in heaven, heavenly things. Of course you can't. Who could try to understand
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:58.360]   such a glorious, amazing scheme? Do you know the Apostle Peter tells us this, that not only can no
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.920]   men ever understand the plan of redemption, even angels can't. Peter puts it like this in his first
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.080]   epistle, first chapter, verses 10 and following, "Of which salvation the prophets have inquired
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.560]   and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, searching what
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.680]   or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.280]   beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed,
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:31.960]   that not unto themselves, but unto us, they did minister these things which are now reported unto
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:37.840]   you by them that have preached unto you the gospel with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven." Listen,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:48.520]   which things the angels desire to look into? The angels don't understand them. The Apostle Paul
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.960]   again puts it in writing to the Ephesians in the third chapter in verse 10, he says, "This is God's
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   great plan, to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:11.920]   might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God." The principalities and powers in the
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:17.680]   heavenly places. The angels don't understand this. This is the mind of the eternal and everlasting
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:23.960]   God. This is something that God has planned and purposed. And man says, "I don't understand this.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:30.520]   How can these things be? I'm not going to believe unless I understand." Oh fool, you'll spend your
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:38.080]   eternity trying to understand the incomprehensible, and that's hell. And you've shut yourself out from
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:48.160]   all the glories and the blessings of God's eternal grace in Jesus Christ his Son. Or are you still
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:56.360]   foolish enough to try to understand the person of our Lord himself? You know, he puts this to Nicodemus,
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:02.240]   and he puts it in this way, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:09.480]   even the Son of Man which is in heaven." Do you understand that? No man has ascended up to heaven,
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:17.680]   you understand that, because nobody has. No man has ever ascended into heaven. Man, oh wait a
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.760]   minute, says somebody, "Why haven't you heard about the Sputniks?" Quite right, you laugh it
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:37.680]   out of court, you ridicule it. What utter nonsense it is. No man hath ascended into heaven, but he that
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:44.760]   came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven. He's come down, but he's still there.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.960]   How can these things be? Exactly. If you are going to rely on that little bit of brain you've got,
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:59.960]   you'll be the miserable wretch you are and always have been, forever and forever. You need to be
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:06.200]   born again, my friend, and you need to realize that these things are beyond understanding.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:16.840]   The person of Jesus Christ, in heaven, God, as descended, Son of Man, man, God and man,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:24.560]   yet only one person. Not two persons, two natures, but one person. Are you seriously trying to
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:30.160]   understand that? These are heavenly things, my friends. This is the glorious gospel of salvation.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.680]   It's the only hope for the world this morning. If the future of this world is in the hands of men,
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:41.040]   we are already undone. But it's not. Here's the message. God so loved the world that he sent his
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:48.320]   only begotten Son, the Incarnation, the eternal Son of God, being born as a man, the Word being
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.600]   made flesh and dwelling among us, and yet still in heaven while he was on earth. God and men,
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:41:00.440]   two natures in one person and yet unmixed. This, you see, is of the very essence of the gospel,
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:06.600]   and he has come to give us a life that corresponds to that. Now, you see, when will we have the
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:12.920]   wisdom to understand that we mustn't attempt to understand these things? Listen to Charles Wesley.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:20.680]   We sang it just now. "Stronger is love than death or hell. Its riches are unsearchable. The
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:29.360]   firstborn sons of light desire in vain its depths to see. They cannot reach the mystery. The length
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:41.080]   and breadth and height. God only knows the love of God." That's the answer to all our foolish
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:49.800]   questioning and to all this utterance of how can these things be? 'Tis mystery all. The immortal
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:59.080]   dies. Who can explore his strange design? In vain the firstborn seraph tries to sound the depths
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:15.760]   of love divine. 'Tis mercy all. Let earth adore. Let angel minds inquire no more. You see, these
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:22.200]   men, they've all seen this. Did you notice the hymn that we sang at the beginning? "Almighty God
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:32.880]   to thee," says Isaac Watts, "be endless honor done. The undivided free and the mysterious one.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:50.520]   Where reason fails with all her powers, there faith prevails and love adores." And that's the
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:58.240]   true Christian experience. You realize that the character of these things is such, their heavenly
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.440]   character, that you're in a realm altogether above and beyond man at the very tiptoe of his
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:12.360]   achievement. You're face to face with the everlasting and eternal God. Great is the mystery
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:22.760]   of Godliness. And that is not only true of the being of God in three persons. It is true of the
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:29.480]   whole of the salvation that is given us. That's the glory of this message. It's not human, it's not
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:35.800]   earthly, it's divine. It's God's way of salvation. It is life which is life indeed. It's eternal life,
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:42.960]   it's life in the Spirit, beyond not only the understanding but even the imagination of men.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:50.720]   So you see, it comes to this, and we shall have to go on elaborating this. There's only one thing to
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:59.080]   do. It is to submit in utter ignorance and helplessness and hopelessness to this One who
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:06.960]   is speaking. No man hath ascended up to heaven, and no man ever will. If you are trusting to modern
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.520]   knowledge and modern understanding, or if you are hoping that it's going to increase, and that perhaps
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.200]   by the middle of next century, if there is such a time, if man hasn't already blown his world to
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:22.120]   nothing, that man will have arrived at a great knowledge of ultimate truth. You're the biggest
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:33.920]   fool in the universe. No man hath ascended up to heaven, and no man ever will. It's impossible. He
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.720]   can't understand himself, leave alone ascend into heaven. The passing of the ages therefore makes
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:46.920]   no difference. We are utterly and entirely dependent upon this One. Why? Well, because we
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:52.400]   are concerned about heavenly things. We don't know, we haven't seen, we've never been there,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:45:02.120]   we can never arrive there. But He does. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.960]   He's not a philosopher, He's not a speculator, He's not a seeker and searcher after truth,
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:14.720]   He's not engaged in scientific experimentation. We speak that we do know, and testify that we
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:24.120]   have seen. No man hath seen God at any time. They speculate about Him, they say He's the ground of
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:30.680]   being. They say He's the absolute. But what's it mean? It's meaningless, there's no sense there.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:37.120]   They've never seen Him, they never can. No man hath seen God at any time, no man can see God
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:44.960]   and live. But here is one who says, we testify that we have seen. Why? Well, because He's the
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:50.680]   Eternal Son. He's come out of the bosom of the Father. He hath declared Him. He is one who's
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:56.800]   looked into the face, into the eyes of God. He's a witness, He's come from heaven. He's not trying
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.520]   to get up, He's come down. And He's telling us, He's reporting to us, He's leading it out,
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:12.400]   He's manifesting it to us. And there is only one thing for us to do, and that is to receive Him,
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:22.920]   and to receive His witness and His testimony. He tells us that we must be born again. He tells us
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:28.880]   that we can be born again. He's come in order that it might be possible. He's come to reconcile us to
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:36.880]   God, to take away the sin that blinds us. He's come to make us the children of God, to introduce
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.120]   us into the presence of God. He's given us His Spirit, and the work of the Spirit is to give us
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.080]   this understanding, this knowledge, this enlightenment, this experience, to lift us
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:59.440]   up into the realm of heavenly things, and to enjoy them more and more. Oh, my dear friend,
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:08.840]   my one appeal to you is just this. Beware of setting limits to the possibility of the Christian
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:17.320]   life. The Apostle Paul prays for the Ephesians, that they may be strengthened with might by His
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:23.040]   Spirit in the inner men. What for? Well, that in order that they, with all other saints, may begin
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.400]   to learn and to comprehend what is the breadth, and the length, and the depth, and the height,
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:38.040]   and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that we might be filled with all the
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:47.400]   fullness of God. I am not asking you this morning whether you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:54.600]   assuming that you do. What I am asking you is this. What do you know about these heavenly things?
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:04.040]   Are you any communion with heaven and with God? When you get down on your knees to say your
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:15.240]   prayers, are you talking to yourself or to God? Heavenly things, life eternal, that they might
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:27.480]   know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent, beloved people. If only we
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   knew something of the possibilities of this life of grace, this life in the Spirit, our whole
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:42.760]   condition would be changed, and that of the Church. And through us the blessing would spread to the
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:51.280]   perishing masses that are dying outside in the ignorance and the darkness of sin and evil. Amen.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:49:01.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
