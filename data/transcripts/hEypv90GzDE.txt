[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Welcome to this 20-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.480]   Non-sleep deep rest is a powerful tool that can allow you to control the relaxation state
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.520]   of your nervous system and your overall state of mind.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.480]   It can restore mental and physical vigor, and it can be done any time of day or night.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.600]   It can even partially offset the negative consequences of getting too little sleep.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.680]   Non-sleep deep rest takes advantage of the fact that specific forms of breathing place
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.320]   us into a state of deep relaxation by slowing our heart rate down.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.160]   It also takes advantage of the fact that we can control our perception, that is, which
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.280]   sensations we are focused on.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.660]   Sensations are simply the conversion of physical events in the world into a language that our
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.840]   body and brain can understand.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.720]   It's a process by which things like photons of light, mechanical pressure on our skin,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.080]   sound waves, and so on, are converted to electrical and chemical signals in our neurons or nerve
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.240]   cells.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.320]   Perception is simply the sensations that we happen to be focused on at a given moment,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.360]   and perception is an incredible aspect of our nervous system.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.040]   We can't directly control what sensations are around us and inside of us.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.400]   They are just there, but we can control our two kinds of perceptions.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   One kind of perception is called exteroception and is when we pay attention to things around
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.200]   us, beyond the confines of our skin.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.040]   The other type of perception is called interoception, and it's when we pay attention to things
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.520]   at the level of the surface of our skin and inward, inside our body.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.040]   With non-sleep deep rest, you can shift your brain state from one of thinking, stress,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.960]   planning, from anticipation of any kind, positive or negative, to one of pure sensation and
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.320]   deep relaxation.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.080]   It's very simple to do.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.120]   You'll want to do this protocol seated or lying down, so if you're not already seated
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.160]   or lying down, please do so now.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.400]   You'll also want to close your eyes, so if your eyes aren't already closed, please close
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.360]   them now.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:02.920]   Throughout this protocol, you'll want to breathe normally, unless instructed to do otherwise.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.480]   One pattern of breathing you'll be asked to do is to inhale deeply, ideally through your
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.920]   nose, but if you can't do it through your nose, inhale through your mouth.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.600]   Try that now.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale all of your air through your mouth.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.520]   Let's do that again.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.320]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale completely through your mouth.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:47.720]   And as you exhale, exhale through thinly pursed lips, as if through a small straw.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.000]   Let's repeat that two more times.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:03.440]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale completely through thinly pursed lips.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.460]   One more time.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:15.400]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale completely through your mouth through
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.160]   thinly pursed lips.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.800]   Breathing in that way, that is, inhaling deeply through your nose, and then exhaling completely
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.320]   through the mouth through thinly pursed lips, is known to slow your heart rate down and
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.920]   relax your nervous system.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.140]   Feel free now to simply breathe normally.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.420]   Now in your mind's eye, imagine yourself standing over yourself, looking at your body,
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.720]   which is seated or lying down, and imagine holding a flashlight or a spotlight and directing
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   it at your feet.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.340]   Focus your attention on whatever it is that your feet happen to be in contact with.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.880]   It could be socks, sandals, shoes, or merely the air.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.800]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.960]   Focus your attention specifically on the bottoms of your feet and try to perceive whatever
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.840]   it is they are sensing.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.920]   They could be tingling.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.640]   They could even be numb.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:50.920]   Now imagine expanding that spotlight to include the tops of your feet, your shins, your calves.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.680]   Expanding that spotlight further to include your thighs, your hamstrings, and up to your
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.160]   waist.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.440]   Now with your entire lower body illuminated inside the beam of light from that spotlight,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:18.840]   inhale deeply through your nose or through your mouth, and then exhale completely through
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:30.200]   thinly pursed lips until your lungs are empty.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.960]   Repeat that twice more, and each time as you exhale, imagine your lower body sinking down
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:07:07.440]   about a centimeter into whatever surface you happen to be in contact with now.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.760]   Now continue by breathing normally.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:22.440]   Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, imagine your body sinking another centimeter into
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:32.780]   the surface you are lying or sitting down on.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:44.000]   As you inhale, remember to have your belly expand ever so slightly, and as you exhale,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.240]   your stomach will fall ever so slightly.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:02.660]   As you breathe in this manner, continue to imagine the spotlight illuminating your entire
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.360]   body.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:19.000]   As you inhale, you can imagine that spotlight getting slightly brighter, and as you exhale,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.460]   imagine the spotlight getting slightly dimmer.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:40.320]   Continue to inhale, and to exhale while imagining your body sinking down.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:50.640]   Now pay attention to the muscles of your face, and as you continue to breathe normally, try
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:09:03.480]   to relax the muscles of your face, at first only slightly, and then with each subsequent
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:28.160]   breath, relaxing the muscles of your forehead and face more and more.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:39.880]   Now regardless of the environment you are in, try to listen to sounds within that environment.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:58.800]   Whatever happens to be surrounding you, try to hear it.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:15.520]   Perhaps, you can only hear the sound of your own breathing.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.040]   Perhaps, there are noises in the room.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:46.200]   Regardless of the sounds you hear, try to focus on them.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.440]   Now you will breathe in the same manner you breathed before, with a deep inhale through
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:11:05.280]   your nose, until your lungs are full, and then a slow, complete exhale through slightly
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:13.960]   pursed lips.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.920]   Let's repeat that again.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:30.060]   Inhale through your nose, until your lungs are full, then exhale slowly through your
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:45.880]   mouth with slightly pursed lips.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:59.360]   Now in your mind's eye, try to imagine your body again illuminated by a spotlight.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:16.040]   Imagine looking down at yourself, and your entire body is illuminated by that spotlight.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:31.000]   Dim that spotlight in your mind by about 50%, and as you do so, deliberately relax the muscles
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:49.460]   of your legs, and deliberately relax the muscles of your hands, sensing your palms, wrists,
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:58.400]   and fingers.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:13.040]   Continue to breathe normally, and in your mind's eye, dim the spotlight 50% further
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:36.440]   still, so that the image of your body in your mind's eye is barely a silhouette.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:51.320]   Now, in your mind's eye, make the spotlight brighter.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:58.120]   Try to see any portion of your body in your mind's eye.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:07.440]   Your hands, your arms, your torso, your feet.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:16.880]   No matter if you see one or all of these parts, try to see them as if you are staring down
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:29.480]   at yourself.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.920]   Now move the spotlight to your abdomen, and focus your attention on whatever it is your
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.840]   abdomen is sensing.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:47.200]   As you inhale, your stomach should move out slightly, and as you exhale, it should sink
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.860]   down.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:02.160]   Expand the spotlight to include your upper abdomen, your chest, your neck.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.640]   And now, in your mind's eye, imagine that spotlight is expanding to include your arms
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.240]   as well.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.160]   Continue to breathe normally.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.640]   Now focus your perception on whatever surface your back happens to be in contact with, a
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:29.000]   shirt, a chair, a sofa, whatever surface it happens to be contacting.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.840]   Focus on that contact now.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:42.040]   Simply bring your attention and your perception to those points of contact.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:51.360]   And as you do so, inhale deeply again through your nose or through your mouth.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.440]   And then as you exhale, imagine your back and your upper body sinking about a centimeter
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.840]   into whatever surface they happen to be in contact with.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.080]   Now move the spotlight to include your face, the top of your head, and the back of your
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.000]   head.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.240]   And as you continue to breathe normally, focus your perception on relaxing the muscles of
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:23.880]   your face.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:30.200]   And as you continue to breathe normally, see if you can extend the duration of your exhales
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.280]   ever so slightly.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:43.160]   And now, in your mind's eye, expand the spotlight downward to include your neck, your chest,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:59.980]   your arms, your abdomen, your waist, your legs, and down to your feet.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.920]   Imagine yourself looking down at your own body, illuminated inside of the spotlight.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.560]   And in your mind's eye, deliberately dim that spotlight.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:18.040]   Make the illumination less intense.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.200]   Inhale deeply again through your nose or through your mouth.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:29.320]   And then exhale completely through thinly pursed lips.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:40.440]   And as you do so, imagine your entire body sinking into the surface it's in contact with.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:52.960]   Now while continuing to breathe normally, move your toes ever so slightly.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.700]   You'll notice that you are in control of your nervous system.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.680]   You can direct your perceptions and your actions.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.640]   In doing so, you'll notice that you are in control of your nervous system, meaning you
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:13.400]   direct your perceptions and your actions.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:19.880]   Move your ankles and bend your knees just the slightest bit.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:26.080]   You can move your upper body from side to side, your head from side to side, or even
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   nod just slightly.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:40.840]   Now move your hands, lift your arms just a tiny bit, then set them down again.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:47.760]   And now, whenever you are ready, slowly open your eyes.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.800]   And as you do so, you'll notice that normally your nervous system is bombarded with sensory
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:01.720]   information, mostly visual information, which you have eliminated during this non-sleep
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.340]   deep rest protocol.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.680]   As you have now experienced, you are in control of your perceptions.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.920]   Controlling your perceptions is simply directing your attention to specific sensations, and
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:23.320]   you control which sensations you perceive by directing your attentional spotlight to
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.840]   whatever part or parts of your body that you choose.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.140]   This reflects the remarkable power of the human brain.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:40.720]   You can direct your actions, your perceptions, and you can do so in order to bring about
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.600]   deep relaxation.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:51.880]   You can also do that to achieve heightened states of alertness or attention to any sensation
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:58.480]   outside of you or within you.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:05.680]   Non-sleep deep rest protocols, such as this one, can help you restore your sense of mental
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:14.360]   and physical vigor, can partially offset the effects of not getting enough sleep, and can
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.840]   also help you get better at falling and staying asleep.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:28.760]   It can be done any time of day or night when you feel you need a mental and/or physical
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.240]   reset.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.520]   Thank you for joining me for this non-sleep deep rest protocol brought to you by Huberman
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.560]   Lab and AG1.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:50.560]   [silence]
