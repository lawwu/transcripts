[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   [silence]
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.300]   What are your thoughts on sort of pure estrogen birth control?
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.100]   This is what I learned when I was in college
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.140]   is that birth control is basically tonic estrogen.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.840]   So constantly taking estrogen, estrogen,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.140]   women are taking estrogen
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.140]   so that they don't get the estrogen priming of progesterone,
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.780]   you're not getting any ovulation.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.140]   And I've known women that have been taking,
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.780]   or that took oral contraception,
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.780]   as like estrogen pills basically for five, 10, 15 years.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.480]   Are there long-term consequences of this
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.820]   as it relates to pregnancy, PCOS, menopause?
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.740]   If so, what are some of those consequences?
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.200]   What are your concerns?
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.960]   What do you like about oral contraceptives?
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.240]   What do you dislike about them?
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.360]   - I like how balanced you ask that question.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.880]   So women who take oral contraceptives,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.160]   as long as you're describing like 10 years or longer,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.720]   we call those Olympic oral contraceptive users.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.940]   In terms of benefit, I think that,
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.160]   especially when they first came out and even now,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.260]   it gives women reproductive choice, and that's essential.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.160]   As you may know,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.320]   our reproductive choice has been declining recently.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.840]   So I'm a big fan in that regard,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.800]   and we've got a lot of data to show both the risks
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.820]   and also the benefits of it.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.000]   So I'll speak first into the benefits
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   because I'm gonna get on a soap box a little bit
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.680]   about the risks.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.400]   So we know that it reduces the risk of ovarian cancer.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.760]   So there's something about this idea of incessant ovulation
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.320]   that is not good for the female body.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   So if you look at, for instance, women who are nuns,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.160]   who don't take oral contraceptives
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.020]   and they have a period every single month
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.820]   of their reproductive lives,
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.300]   they have a greater risk of ovarian cancer.
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.300]   So if you look then at women who have several babies
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.340]   and they've got a period of time when they're pregnant
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.420]   that they're not ovulating,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.620]   and then they breastfeed for some period of time,
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.820]   they have a lower risk of ovarian cancer.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.640]   So oral contraceptives help with reducing ovulation
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.380]   and reducing risk.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.860]   We know that if you take the oral contraceptive
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.860]   for about five years,
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.660]   it reduces your risk of ovarian cancer by 50%.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.580]   And that's significant because we're so poor
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.300]   at diagnosing ovarian cancer early.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.740]   There's really no method that's really effective.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.300]   We use CA-125 and ultrasound screening,
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.180]   especially in women who are at greater genetic risk.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.760]   But even that, often we diagnose it in a later stage.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.580]   - Maybe just because that statement is gonna highlight
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.620]   for a number of people the question
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.100]   of what are some of the earliest symptoms
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.960]   that people can recognize without a blood test?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.120]   So is ovarian cancer, is it gonna be pain?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.700]   - So the problem is the symptoms are so vague
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.120]   and they're so nonspecific.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.140]   One of the most common symptoms is bloating.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.700]   And we've already talked about constipation.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.780]   We've talked about how women have this longer GI track.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.940]   And so bloating is a really common experience
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.420]   for most women.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.980]   You can have bulk symptoms,
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.020]   feeling like your lower belly is kind of pressed out.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.020]   So the way that we inform women
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.700]   in terms of watching for this
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.300]   is to get regular gynecologic exams
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.620]   for women who are at high risk
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.100]   or they have, for instance, an ultrasound for some reason
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.420]   and it shows a mass that we're concerned about.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.720]   There's a way to triage that
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.400]   in terms of what kind of evaluation that they need.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.900]   And that's the situation where you might get a blood test
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.260]   called the CA-129.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.100]   CA-125.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.400]   Yeah, the problem is the symptoms are so vague.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.180]   It could be, it depends on how big the tumor is,
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.060]   how much bulk you have, what it's pressing on.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.560]   - So if taking estrogen
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.300]   and thereby reducing the frequency of ovulation
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.140]   lowers the risk of ovarian cancer,
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.700]   should women that are,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.340]   even women who are not sexually active,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.860]   so they're not actively trying to get pregnant
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.300]   or avoid getting pregnant,
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.580]   but if they're not sexually active,
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.420]   then the probability of conceiving
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.700]   unless they go through some IUI or some other route
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.760]   is very low as far as I know.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.740]   That's what I was taught in high school anyway.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.460]   Would they be wise to suppress ovulation
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.940]   for periodically using hormone-based contraception
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.620]   just so that they can offset the risk of ovarian cancer?
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.300]   - That's a very rational question.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900]   And I would say that's what mainstream medicine
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.860]   has had at its back to recommend oral contraceptives,
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.060]   not just for women who are seeking contraception,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.540]   but for acne, for painful periods,
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.380]   for really kind of the drop of a hat,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.900]   they're prescribing oral contraceptives.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.620]   That's what I was taught to do.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.580]   But there's so many consequences.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.020]   And I think the issue here is more about consent
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.660]   because in OB/GYN,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.860]   and I started out as a board-certified OB/GYN
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.500]   and I now mostly see men,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.820]   but I was taught as an OB/GYN to convince women
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.340]   to go on the oral contraceptive.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.240]   And I think a lot of that is pharmaceutical influence.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.060]   So maybe we could talk about the risks
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.540]   and why the answer is no to your question.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.120]   - As we do that, could I just ask,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.020]   is the so-called ring,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.220]   it used to be called the NuvaRing,
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.060]   maybe that's a brand name,
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.140]   but when I was in college,
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.220]   there was all this discussion about the ring, right?
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.300]   By both men and women for reasons that don't belong
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.460]   on the podcast, use your imagination folks.
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.820]   So is the ring, obviously it's not oral,
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.780]   it's not oral hormone contraception,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.060]   but it's hormone-based, right?
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.300]   The ring is releasing estrogen locally
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.380]   as opposed to taking it orally,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.180]   but would you slot it under what you're about to tell us
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.420]   in terms of the concerns?
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.100]   - So we have less data about the ring.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.900]   So the oral contraceptive is two hormones,
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.880]   it's ethinyl estradiol,
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.620]   and it's a progestin.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.220]   So it's not the normal progesterone that your body makes,
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.060]   that your ovaries make and your adrenals make,
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.060]   it is a synthetic form of progesterone.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.800]   And it is the same progestin,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.220]   similar, same class,
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.300]   that was shown to be dangerous and provocative
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.080]   in the Women's Health Initiative.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.860]   So I'm not a fan of progestins,
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.020]   I do not recommend them for any woman,
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.940]   unless the consequence of not taking them
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.560]   is surgery or some other,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.820]   unless it gives them some freedom in some way.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.480]   So I don't like progestins.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.480]   The NuvaRing is estrogen plus progestin,
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.220]   but it's released transdermally through the vagina.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.220]   So given the way that it's delivered to the vagina,
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.740]   the doses are lower than what's taken orally.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.340]   But in terms of some of the risks
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.320]   that I'm about to talk about,
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.900]   we don't know about much of the data.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.180]   We think that it's similar,
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.540]   there's probably a spectrum of risk,
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.820]   and the NuvaRing is a little more towards the middle
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.460]   than what I'm talking about with oral contraceptives.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.380]   Are you ready for that?
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.780]   - Yeah, I'm ready for the risks.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.460]   - Okay, so like with almost any pharmaceutical,
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.500]   the oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.220]   So magnesium, there's certain vitamin Bs that are depleted.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.020]   It also affects the microbiome.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.600]   That data is not as strong,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.980]   but there seems to be some effect,
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.600]   and there's also an increased risk
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.060]   of inflammatory bowel disease in autoimmune condition.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.740]   It increases inflammatory tone.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.620]   So the studies that I've seen increase
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.980]   one of the markers of inflammatory tone,
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.280]   high sensitivity to CRP, by about two to three X.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.420]   It seems to make the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.300]   more rigid so that you can't kind of roll with the punches
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.820]   and wax and wane in terms of cortisol production
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.260]   the way that you can off the birth control pill.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.860]   It can affect thyroid function.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.900]   I'm thinking of the slide that I have
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.420]   that has like 10 problems
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.860]   associated with the oral contraceptive,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.860]   but that's what I can remember right now.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.900]   - That's very helpful.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.160]   And it makes me wonder whether or not,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.940]   if on the one hand oral contraceptives
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.220]   are protective in women against ovarian cancer,
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.580]   but then they have these other issues.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.980]   - Yeah, there's one other I wanna mention.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.140]   - Please.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.540]   - Anytime you take oral estrogen,
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.980]   it raises sex hormone-binding globulin.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.460]   And you've talked to other podcast guests about this,
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.900]   Kyle, I think.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.320]   Sex hormone-binding globulin, I think of as a sponge
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.000]   that soaks up free estrogen and free testosterone.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.800]   So when you go on the birth control pill,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.100]   you raise your sex hormone-binding globulin.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.480]   It soaks up especially free testosterone.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.880]   And for some women, it's not a big deal.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.840]   They don't notice much of a difference.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.620]   But then there's a phenotype,
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.160]   maybe related to CAG repeats on the androgen receptor,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.320]   who are exquisitely sensitive to that decline
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.240]   in free testosterone.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.020]   So this then opens the portal of talking a little bit
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.040]   about testosterone in women.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.360]   So we've mentioned already that it's the most abundant,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.960]   biologically the most abundant hormone in the female system.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.480]   Even though men make almost 10 times as much
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.360]   or even more than 10 times, it is so important for women.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   It is essential to so many things,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.640]   not just sex drive and muscle mass
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.520]   and seeing a response to resistance training,
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.320]   but also confidence and agency.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.280]   And so those women who are so sensitive
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.440]   to their testosterone level,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.960]   they've got this high sex hormone-binding globulin,
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.360]   their testosterone declines.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.240]   What they describe is vaginal dryness,
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.600]   maybe a decline in sex drive.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.800]   But there's also this bigger issue
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.440]   related to confidence and agency,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.920]   even risk-taking from studies that we've done
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.060]   with MBA students that I think is a serious problem.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.600]   Maybe the most important out of all of these things
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.200]   is that it can shrink the clitoris
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.840]   by up to 20%, 20%.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.640]   - And that includes a regression of the nerves
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.400]   that innervate the clitoris, is that?
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.600]   - That's a very good question as a neuroscientist.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.920]   - Yeah, I would think used to teach
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.000]   the neural side of reproductive health.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.440]   We need to do a series on sexual health.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.680]   Maybe you would co-host that with me.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.080]   - Sure.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.160]   - We could certainly use your expertise.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.200]   I think, yeah, that's a dramatic number.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.680]   - Yeah, but then let's go back to the sacred marketing.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.480]   If I've got a woman that I think
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.880]   should not be on the birth control pill,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.200]   maybe she's taking it for acne,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.840]   or she's taking it 'cause her periods
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.960]   were a little painful.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.080]   What I'm gonna do is say,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.160]   let's leverage these other ways
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.400]   of making your period less painful.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.680]   Let's take the message of your painful periods
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.080]   and figure out, okay, is it your inflammatory tone?
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.000]   And we give you some fish oil and SPMs,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.040]   maybe a little aspirin when you've got your period.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.240]   Like, let's find some other ways to deal with it
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.320]   than to take the oral contraceptive,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.480]   which you have not received informed consent about,
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.760]   because it can trick your clit by up to 20%.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.840]   Now, that usually convinces most people
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.360]   to come off of it. - Is that reversible?
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.680]   - The elevation in sex hormone binding globulin
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.760]   does not seem to go away
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.440]   when you come off the birth control pill.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   To me, that is the biggest problem
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.840]   with prescribing oral contraceptives.

[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.040]   (upbeat music)
