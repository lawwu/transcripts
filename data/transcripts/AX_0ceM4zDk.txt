[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Today we have a very specific question, but one that I think draws attention to much larger
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.320]   questions that we all face with Bible interpretation.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.040]   The specific question on the table is this, "Why does the author of Hebrews belabor Christ's
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.040]   supremacy over angels?"
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.280]   It's a question that comes in from a young man, Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.980]   Why do you think the writer of Hebrews spends so much time declaring that Jesus is greater
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.920]   than the angels?
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.860]   This is especially the case in those first two chapters.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.500]   You would think that identifying Jesus as God and expounding upon the Trinity would
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.040]   be a better way of declaring the truth of Jesus's greatness, that the writer of Hebrews
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.000]   wouldn't need to compare Jesus to angels.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.040]   The emphasis on angels is for a reason.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.600]   I just can't figure out why.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.040]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.240]   I'm not sure, but it may be that the assumption of this question is that there is some key
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.600]   to answering the question from outside the book of Hebrews in the first century milieu.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560]   I'm not sure, but that's often the case.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.860]   So let me just say a word about that assumption.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.840]   I want to say something about the role of information from the first century coming
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.120]   from outside the Bible and used to interpret the Bible.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.400]   And what I want to say is this, in, I dare say, 99% of the cases where something from
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.000]   outside the Bible might inform the meaning of what's in the Bible, it's the precise
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.700]   details and context of the biblical text itself, which finally determines whether information
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.120]   from outside the Bible is decisive or not.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.080]   That's very crucial.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.240]   Generally what we read from first century documents, say, applies very generally rather
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.100]   than with any precise specificity to our particular New Testament author or our particular document
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.880]   or our particular text and context.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.840]   When it comes down to deciding on the meaning of the text, it's almost always the case
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.460]   that the words and phrases and flow of thought in this book, combined with what the author
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.000]   has said elsewhere, decide the meaning.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.040]   And I say that so that the average reader of the Bible doesn't operate on the assumption
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.760]   that there's this goldmine of discovery just waiting to be had about the meaning of
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.080]   this text outside the Bible, if I just had hours and hours and knew some languages, oh,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.200]   I could mine this goldmine of insight for the text outside the Bible.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.240]   No, the goldmine is under your nose.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.440]   And it's in English, it's in English.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.680]   And if for every hour you spend poking around in first century documents outside the Bible,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   you spend a hundred hours ransacking the details of the author's words, the New Testament
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.400]   author's words and phrases and sentences and logical connections and flow of thought
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:28.640]   and wider views in his writings, you will find vast riches of gold you would never find
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.280]   if you switched and spent an hour with the Bible and a hundred hours outside.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   Some scholars will go on debating till doomsday how much angel worship there was in the first
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.460]   century, say, as a possible background to Hebrews and what form it took and how much
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.060]   the apostles may have encountered it.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.940]   But we know that already from Colossians 2.18, "Let no one disqualify you insisting on asceticism
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.440]   and worship of angels."
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.120]   And John's temptation in Revelation 22.8, "John fell down to worship at the feet of
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.080]   the angel who showed them to me.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.000]   And he said to me, 'You must not do that.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.620]   Worship God.'"
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.480]   But is that the background for the book of Hebrews?
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.840]   Do we know for sure that the churches this book was sent to were dealing with that temptation?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.660]   No, we don't know that.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.520]   It would be sheer guesswork to draw from general facts that there was such a thing as angel
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.440]   worship in the first century the specific conclusion that that's the reason there's
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.280]   such a focus on putting Jesus above angels in the book of Hebrews.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.000]   A preacher—now here's where it gets really practical—a preacher who stands up and makes
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.280]   a big deal out of first century angel worship as the background of Hebrews is like a miner
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.360]   carrying scraps of gold shavings into the gold mine of Hebrews where the walls are bright
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.400]   with veins of pure gold waiting to be dug out.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.120]   So let me mention several veins of gold for our friend who asked this question, veins
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.280]   that he can dig into when we're done.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.720]   First, he suggests that it might be better for the writer to focus on the deity of Christ
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.560]   than to focus on his superiority to angels.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.400]   Well, evidently not, because that's not what he did.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.760]   And I think the author of Hebrews would respond by saying, "I'm not talking about angels
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.600]   as an alternative to talking about the deity of Christ.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.120]   I'm talking about angels as a means of talking about the deity of Christ.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.960]   One way to teach the deity of Christ in my situation is to disabuse people of any notion
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.800]   at all that he's a top angel."
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.400]   So he says in Hebrews 1.6, "Let all God's angels worship him."
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.560]   Whoa, I love that sentence.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.440]   That sentence is not an alternative to talking about the deity of Christ.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.560]   It's a thunderclap showing the deity of Christ.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.760]   Let every angelic being in heaven and hell fall on their faces and worship Jesus, very
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   God of very God.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.600]   You don't dare worship what is not God.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.520]   Second observation, the author takes an Old Testament idea, which might lead some people
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.600]   to elevate angels more highly than they should, and he turns it around so it has the exact
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.840]   opposite effect.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:00.520]   He refers in chapter 2, verse 2 of Hebrews, to the Mosaic law coming to us through angels.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:09.160]   And then he says, "Since the law through angels came with such authority and consequence,
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.920]   how much more the message declared to us by the Lord."
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.280]   In other words, if you're impressed with the role of angels in giving the law, be a
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.720]   thousand times more impressed with the role of Jesus in giving the gospel.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:37.840]   Third observation, in exalting Jesus above angels, he helps us know the proper place,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.920]   not just of Jesus, but of angels, angels themselves, and the proper place of ourselves.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.320]   In other words, more is going on here than just the superiority of Jesus over angels.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:57.040]   So for example, in chapter 1, verse 14, when you demote angels from competing with the
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:04.480]   Son of God for glory, then they can have their true glory, which is, amazingly, to be our
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   servants.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   Amazing.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:14.920]   He says, "Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.360]   are to inherit salvation?"
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.240]   So these competitors with the Son of God for glory turn out to be our servants.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.260]   Oh my goodness.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.880]   So more is going on than we think.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.520]   The author has multiple reasons for talking about angels.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.400]   Final observation, and I'm leaving out some really juicy ones, by the way.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:46.280]   Keep in mind that sometimes the Bible says things that seem very foreign to our experience,
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.240]   and we wonder why such an emphasis might be there.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:57.960]   For example, not many people in the West today are wrestling with whether Jesus' relationship
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.160]   to angels is this or that.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:08.240]   But don't assume that will be the case when the Bible is translated and read in hundreds
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:16.740]   of other cultures, where this particular emphasis might be exactly what the Holy Spirit will
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.920]   use to awaken an entire people group to the reality of Christ's greatness.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:29.640]   And the reason I point to that is because I remember the story of how useless one missionary
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:37.320]   thought the genealogies were in the beginning of Matthew, and then he read them to a Stone
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.880]   Age tribe, and they were all ears.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.320]   They were riveted.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:50.740]   And in the end, they said, "Well, then he's not just a spirit."
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:57.580]   And it was the genealogies that broke the back of unbelief and a thousand years of darkness.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:04.800]   Who knows what cultures are waiting for this message about angels in Hebrews that may blow
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.760]   things wide open for the gospel.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   Wow.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.160]   Great story with an incredibly important point.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.680]   There's a lot in this episode to process as a Bible reader.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.280]   Thank you, Pastor John, for all of it.
