[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   One question I get a lot is if you were 25 years old,
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.080]   where would you live to maximize your financial returns?
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.640]   This is the most obvious answer in the world, which is the Bay Area.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.160]   The reason is this is the place where you go to get work done.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.440]   There's a reason why most of the Magnificent Seven were founded
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.400]   and built and scaled, not just specifically in the Bay Area,
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.080]   but in the peninsula, meaning south of San Francisco.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.400]   The interesting thing about Palo Alto is that there's literally nothing to do there.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.240]   It's a place where you come to work.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.120]   If you're trying to do something really important, it takes enormous dedication,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.240]   almost to the point of having no other priorities.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.400]   And that is much easier to do in a place where there are no distractions
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.000]   than in a place like New York or Miami.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   These are not the places I typically think of as aggregating talent
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.920]   who will basically dedicate themselves at all costs to an idea.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.760]   Startups are those.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.120]   They are these very ambitious ideas that can very quickly die
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760]   if people don't breathe life into it.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.720]   And I think you're much more likely to do that
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.800]   when you have nothing else to do except to give your life to that idea.
