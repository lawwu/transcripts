[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   All right, so it is the first episode in September to come out.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.540]   So as is my tradition, speaking of segments that aren't directly related to help you live
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.400]   your life deeper, as is my tradition, these traditions are going to live on, Jesse.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.620]   I talked about the books I read the month before.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:27.120]   So I want to briefly mention the five books I read in August of 2022.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.280]   Now I have to say this list is a summer list.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.280]   So a warning.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   It's very much influenced by the fact I was on vacation.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.200]   So you're going to see the beginning of the list is vacation books and then the other
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.600]   part of the list as I got back from vacation.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.040]   All right, so let me start with GoldenEye.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040]   I mentioned this on the show before.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.500]   2016 book by Matthew Parker.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.800]   This is a book about Ian Fleming, the novelist who created James Bond, about the house he
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.600]   built in Jamaica and its influence, his time in Jamaica and its influence on the James
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600]   Bond series.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.720]   It's a British book, very deeply researched.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.680]   I learned quite a bit about late stage colonial England, what happened in Jamaica, how that
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960]   country was transformed.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.840]   You get a lot of interesting context and a lot of tidbits about how Fleming and his life.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.160]   It's basically a biography of Fleming.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.980]   It's basically a biography of late stage colonialism in the British empire, all mixed up into this
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.980]   package.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.980]   So very ambitious book.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.200]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.760]   Also a lot of good cabin, what you might call, there's a book called Cabin Porn, where it's
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.400]   just pictures of beautiful cabins.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.720]   This is sort of like deep work writing porn, right?
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.440]   It's on a bluff writing over a cove that you snorkel in every day.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.640]   So you get a lot of that too.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.360]   One interesting point to say about that book, when Ian Fleming, this is a reveal in the
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.680]   book, when Ian Fleming left the service after the war, so World War II, he was obviously
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.840]   like in the military and that's where he was stationed in Jamaica briefly.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.460]   That's how he found out about it and that's why he built his house there.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.560]   He got a job after the war with a newspaper group that owned the Sunday Times and he was
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.480]   the manager, coordinator of foreign correspondents.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.680]   His contract he negotiated included three months vacation a year.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.440]   That's how he could go to Jamaica every winter.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   It's just his contract.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.960]   He was like, I just am gone in the winter.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.460]   So I mean, of course, this is British class privilege at its finest.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.400]   You could just imagine his boss being like, good show old chop.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.800]   Yes, you'd go away in the winter.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.080]   You can't work then.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.840]   By the way, spot on English accent.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.840]   Very good.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   I was just in Scotland.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   Sounds identical.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   Exactly.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.360]   I would pass as a native in Scotland.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.080]   But I mentioned this earlier in the show.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.640]   Yeah, right now you have to be like a pseudo aristocrat in 19, late 1940s Britain to get
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.920]   a contract like that.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.760]   But why is that not more common?
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.720]   Like, why is if you're Facebook, are you not trying to attract engineers by saying, Hey,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.200]   if you're willing to do nine twelfths of the salary, you can take three months off a year.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   You would get more people.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.680]   We need more variety like this.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   That should not be so rare.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680]   So there we go.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   All right.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   Book number two.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   So I read Goldeneye.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   I said, well, I better read a James Bond book.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.760]   And I'm reading about his house.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   I know so much about Fleming.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.920]   I was on vacation at the time.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.200]   It's like, I should probably read a James Bond book.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.820]   Interesting observation.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.320]   They're temporarily not available on Kindle.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.760]   I don't really know what's going on here.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.640]   Just a standard James Bond book.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.320]   American translations are not available on Kindle.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.000]   I think there was a, there's been a transfer of rights.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.080]   I think something about Amazon buying Paramount and maybe Paramount owns the rights.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.640]   And there's some, I saw something I should look into this deeper.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.520]   I saw something about their, maybe the reformatting and going to republish these, but it was very
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   hard to find.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.520]   So I basically got a pirated copy.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.720]   The only one I could find on my Kindle, because I was on vacation.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.400]   So I didn't want to, I couldn't just Amazon a book.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.280]   The only one I could find is basically a pirated e-copy of Moonraker.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.160]   It's one of the early, it's a 1960s James Bond novel.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   Interesting point, two interesting points about it.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:26.880]   One, it has the first third of the book is James Bond playing bridge at a fancy club
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.460]   in London.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:37.120]   Only two thirds of the book, he is at a high-tech missile installation trying to stop a villain
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.180]   from dropping a nuclear bomb on London.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.420]   So it seems a little incongruous.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.840]   I looked into it.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.700]   Turns out Moonraker was based off a teleplay that Fleming wrote about the missile and this
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.700]   or that.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   It wasn't long enough.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.540]   Was it long enough when he translated to a book like this is not, we can't, it's not
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.540]   long enough to sell us a novel.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.780]   So he's like, well, I'll just add a, a scene, extended scene where he plays bridge with
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780]   the villain.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.780]   And you know what?
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.780]   It's a great scene.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.220]   Like the whole premise of the scene is the villains cheating and M as Bond come figure
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.220]   out how he's cheating.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.500]   And again, to all, this is so Fleming, all of the details of this very fancy upper crust
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.980]   club and the food and how they, and the specific drinks that they're drinking and sort of classic
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.140]   Fleming point number two, it's a surprisingly modern techno thriller.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.340]   I think we give credit to Crichton.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.500]   We give credit to Clancy is sort of inventing the genre of high, high pace adventure type
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.140]   thrilling thriller writing that has a lot of technology.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.940]   Moonraker feels like it could have been from that same genre.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.420]   I mean, it's a lot of the technology of the missiles and how it's going to work.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.100]   There's these details involved of it reads like a modern techno thriller.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.780]   I don't think Fleming gets enough credit for techno thriller writing.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.020]   I had, I guess I had assumed that James Bond books were going to be a little bit more like
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.900]   British and ornate and, or maybe like a little bit more a little bit more sort of classic
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.620]   spy type writing.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.140]   We're going to have the sort of spy who came out of the cold Alistair McClain style writing.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.300]   No, it reads like Crichton, this missile and whatever.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.660]   Interesting point number three, this was before the space programs got started.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:20.060]   So Fleming's take on space technology, though specific is very wrong.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.660]   So it's clearly he, he was just guessing, you know, this was the early sixties.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.260]   He was just guessing what would be involved in sending rockets in his world.
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.780]   His guest was like, obviously like you can't send a rocket very far without the fire melting
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.780]   it.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.420]   So like the whole plot was around how this villain had cornered the market on this special
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.140]   material that could hold up to the flames of a rocket.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.220]   And that that was going to be the key.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.540]   It's not even a ballistic missile.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.780]   It's just a missile that can go a thousand miles.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.860]   Sub ballistic required special material and just huge thing.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.780]   And it was interesting.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.540]   All right.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.180]   Then this was speaking of techno thriller.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.140]   So also on vacation, this was at the house.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.620]   I always try to find a thriller just like where I am.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:11.300]   They had a Michael Crichton techno thriller that I had not read 2004's state of fear.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.660]   My memory was I didn't read this.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.260]   I used to read all the Crichton.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.900]   I didn't read this one because I had heard it was sort of weirdly grumpily sort of like
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.300]   polemically anti-climate change.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.380]   Like the whole book was just him being grumpy.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.740]   This is kind of what I had heard about, about, uh, environmentalist and climate change scientists.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.180]   Uh, reality that's true.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.060]   It does read as like he's, he was a grumpy guy, but I mean, it was, it was grumpy.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.860]   He has these long, let me just, he, he has citations throughout the book and he has this
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.740]   character, this MIT professor whose whole job is to have conversations with a good intention,
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.620]   but annoying environmentally minded people who are like, but everyone just knows that
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.020]   blah, blah, blah about climate change.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.780]   And then the MIT professor speaking as a proxy for Crichton would be like, well, it's actually
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.420]   not true, blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.780]   And then Crichton would put real citations under there.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.500]   So I don't know.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.460]   Someone got under his skin about this.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.460]   Um, I think a green piece boat ran over his dog or something.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.460]   I'm not sure.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.460]   So that is true.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:18.060]   Uh, also it's not his best unrelated to that because it starts too slow.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.980]   It's a, it's, it's 150 pages before you're really rolling at what the actual plot is.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:29.020]   Once it gets rolling though, actually very well paced thriller, really great set pieces.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.860]   And we've got, there's one in Antarctica.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:32.860]   That's pretty cool.
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.460]   The, and again, this speaks to his grumpiness.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.300]   There's a, a actor who's clearly supposed to be Martin Sheen.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.700]   It's an actor who played the president on TV.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.700]   Actually yeah, that's right.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.700]   The timing's right.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:52.300]   He was like very environmentalist spoiler alert gets eaten by cannibals in the Solomon
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.300]   Islands.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   It's anyways.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   So here's what I'd say.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.180]   If you can get through a hundred pages, it's a, it's a fine paced thriller.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.900]   He's good at pacing thrillers.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.140]   Um, and if you don't like climate change, you'll love it, but it's also otherwise kind
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.140]   of annoying.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.140]   All right.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.740]   Uh, quickly, two other books.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.700]   Washington goes to war written by David Brinkley in the 1980s, David Brinkley, the former ABC
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.020]   news correspondent.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:20.180]   It is a book about Washington DC and the transformation it made because of world war two.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.620]   And the, the interesting thing about the book is that in the eighties, when Brinkley was
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.900]   writing this, the leaders, the people who were, you know, not 18 year olds, but were
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.400]   a little bit older during world war two, they were all dying.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.580]   And so there was this sort of race against time where he went to gather all these oral
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.580]   histories.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.180]   And if you live in Washington DC, it's a cool book.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:46.980]   It talks about how 1940 Washington DC is a sleepy, very Southern town.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.420]   And by 1945, it's completely different thing.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.340]   So if you live in DC, very interesting.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.820]   If you don't probably not well-written though, Brinkley's, it's a really good, really well-written
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.900]   nonfiction book.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.900]   So hats off.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.140]   And then finally, uh, Tolkien.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.620]   The 2015 biography of Tolkien written by Raymond Edwards, caveat, M.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.300]   Tur, it is an academic biography.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:19.940]   So it really gets deep into the, the work academically that Tolkien was working on and
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.500]   its influence on the books he eventually wrote.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:30.380]   So this is, it's written by a scholar who's in a similar field and it's the study of,
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.300]   it's the study of ancient linguistics, but, but from a standpoint of using the language
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   to try to recreate stuff about the culture and it's a very precise field.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.580]   And so it can be a little bit rough going two things I'll point out about this.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.400]   Then we'll move on.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.180]   Number one, uh, the reason why Lord of the Rings was so successful is that Tolkien just
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:58.480]   spent decades building a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England because there wasn't one.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.560]   So there was a, a founding mythology for Norse culture.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.600]   There's a founding mythology for Germanic cultures, uh, but it was lost.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.920]   Whatever this was for Britain was lost.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.200]   And so he was basically creating one from scratch and he was to spend decades.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.240]   He called it his legit legendarium.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.840]   And he, and at some point he, he kind of moved away from it being specifically about England
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.200]   and about a sort of fantastical realm.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.800]   That is what he pulled from for the Hobbit a little bit and then deeply for Lord of the
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Rings.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.000]   So he spent decades of work as someone who is, uh, it's called philology is what they
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.200]   called it back then an expert at ancient languages and its connection to culture and mythology.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.420]   And he had all of that worked out.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.160]   So that's why when you read Lord of the Rings, it feels like one of these lost culture books
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.440]   where they're just referencing this rich, deep world.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   It feels like it's real.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.040]   It's because he, he, he not only created this world, but he created this world with academic
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   soundness.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:59.080]   I mean, this is a guy who for fun was organizing, uh, I I I Icelandic, uh, Icelandic mythology
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.880]   reading groups where they would read in the ancient Islandic languages, you know, saw
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.680]   Viking sagas.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.120]   So that's why that was so good and why it's so hard.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.960]   Nothing else really approaches the depth.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.480]   You get more of the rings that, uh, that sense of reality.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.920]   If there's a deep culture here that just takes place on it's because it was like the world's
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   expert on doing that, who spent his whole life doing it.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.240]   Number two, it's a painful book to read if you're a professor, because the whole thing
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.960]   is about his frustration with academic administrative load.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:36.560]   I mean, his whole life was defined by being overwhelmed by academic load and, and, and
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.360]   non research type of work.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.180]   And he was constantly short on money and constantly stressed out.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.160]   And this was sort of post-war liberal England.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.240]   So even after you couldn't just sort of leave and be like, I'm just going to write because
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.120]   even after Lord of the Rings became a huge hit, the taxation rates were such an England
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.160]   at the time that as Edwards talks about it, you know, it helped, but like, it didn't make
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.800]   him wealthy even at like a lower level.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.760]   Because you could lose like 80 plus percent of your royalty income like that.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.000]   The government was like, thank you.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.760]   So he was not, so that's, so it's not like he could.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.560]   So even at the, the very height of his success, like he couldn't, wasn't making them that
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   that wealthy.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   Interesting.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.920]   So it stressed me out, Jesse, though, all I was like, man, this is just like detailing.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.800]   It makes modern academic life seem, um, free and flexible and great.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.720]   I mean, Oxford in the early part of the 20th century just sounds like it was brutal.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.440]   Just the work they would pour on you.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.900]   And it was in the infighting and it's an interesting portrait of academia.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.600]   Talk about slow productivity though, when he was coming up with that world, right?
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   Decades.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.960]   Like the Hobbit, uh, it's a 10 year window between when he was like starting to work
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.560]   out the story for his kids and when he sort of finally published it, like you just spend
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   decades on things.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   It's definitely slow productivity.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.960]   Like you can't have Lord of the Rings without 20 years of, uh, philology.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.960]   That's incredible.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   So it was a cool book.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.780]   Again, it's not super approachable.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.720]   His son wrote a book.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.420]   Christopher wrote a book that gets really into like his work habits and stuff like this
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.600]   and focuses more on the Lord of the Rings.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.320]   Like that's probably the better book than this, unless you like your into linguistics.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.220]   (upbeat music)
