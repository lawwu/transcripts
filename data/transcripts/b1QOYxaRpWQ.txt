[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.600]   All right, Jennifer asks, at what age
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.040]   will you allow your kids to have phones and access
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.920]   to social media?
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.320]   Well, we'll see, Jennifer.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.680]   I mean, I think the culture around this, as I talk about,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.200]   is changing.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.880]   So by the time it's relevant, the culture on this
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.520]   may have already changed.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.680]   But in general, right now, the way I think about it
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.800]   is I'm fine with flip phones.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.760]   Whatever age it is that it becomes convenient for you
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.480]   to be able to text your kid.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.800]   They're at sports practice, and can you come pick me up?
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.020]   Or they want to text their friends,
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.480]   like, are you coming over today?
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.640]   I don't know what age that becomes relevant.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.680]   But a flip phone is fine.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.520]   I have no problem with text communication,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   and I recognize that it's useful.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.560]   Giving a kid, however, access to a full smartphone,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.960]   or they have unrestricted access to the internet and social
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.720]   media, sanctioning your kid having social media accounts,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.680]   I would say 16 at the youngest.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.720]   18, from the psychology perspective, is probably better.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.600]   Hey, when you leave this house, you do you.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.960]   But nothing good is going to come from an adolescent brain
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.320]   having access to it.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.200]   This doesn't make me popular among a lot of teenagers.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.880]   However, as I've written before and talked about before,
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.480]   the culture is changing on this.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.840]   I think the idea that teenagers should be using social media
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.040]   is something that we'll look back on six or seven years
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.120]   from now and say that was not a good idea.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.320]   Teenagers themselves are also increasingly
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.120]   turning on this.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.640]   They have moved most of their socializing out
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.920]   of tools such as Snapchat and into instant messenger and text
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.760]   messaging.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.000]   So social media no longer really plays
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.280]   as critical of a role in their social life.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   So it's much easier for them to not be on, say, Instagram
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.800]   or to not be on Snapchat because they're using text and WhatsApp
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.360]   type tools.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.840]   Now the role these tools play in young people's lives
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.720]   is increasingly more cultural and entertainment related.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.440]   So TikTok is very popular with young kids.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.480]   But not being on TikTok is not nearly as big of an issue
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.960]   as seven or eight years ago not being on Snapchat
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.000]   because people aren't using TikTok to talk to each other.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.560]   People aren't using TikTok to discuss
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.640]   with other people in their schools, the party that
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.440]   went on, or to see where people are going,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.080]   or to be plugged into a social scene.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.480]   They're largely consuming content on TikTok.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.040]   So if you're not using it, who cares?
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.160]   You're communicating with your friends on text.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.200]   They might be using TikTok.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.160]   If you're not, what do you miss?
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.640]   There's some cultural theme that you don't know about.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.600]   So I think things are getting better with that.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.240]   But honestly, that is my read of the psychological literature
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.400]   right now is be very, very wary of giving
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.560]   the adolescent brain unrestricted access
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.240]   to social internet tools.
