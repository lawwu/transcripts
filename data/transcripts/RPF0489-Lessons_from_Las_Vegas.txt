[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.760]   In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting here on October 1, 2017, I'd like to use a few
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   minutes of your attention to share some suggestions and thoughts that I hope will be helpful to
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.940]   you. This is Radical Personal Finance, and I try to keep my commentary and discussion
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.680]   on the show focused on personal finance. Today's conversation will be tangentially related
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.800]   to personal finance. Not talking about any personal finance techniques or specific financial
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.900]   planning discussions, but I do think that the comments I have to share with you are
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.160]   appropriate because they are practical and related to real life. In the same way that
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.880]   I consider a discussion of home security, how to protect your items against theft, to
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.280]   be an entirely valid aspect of personal finance, I consider a discussion of personal safety
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.160]   and security to keep you, when possible, from being killed, thus leaving your family without
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.920]   you and without your income, or to keep you from being injured, thus leaving you and your
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.480]   family without income. I consider these topics of personal safety to be important in the
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.720]   context of personal finance discussions. Everything I have to share with you in today's show
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.720]   will be very practical and I believe will be very useful to you.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.560]   Whenever we have events like this, I always try to analyze them and learn any lessons
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.920]   that I can apply to my own life. I'll share just simply my lesson that I have learned
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.160]   from this event and some of the specific actions that I'm going to take as a result of this
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.040]   particular Las Vegas event. I think this is a very practical way to approach analysis
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.600]   of events that other people face, is to always look for the practical lesson, not to look
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.280]   for the thing to get mad about or the thing to get upset about, but look for the practical
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.600]   lesson, the thing that you can practically do. This is very important to me, that we
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.640]   always focus on what we can do and focus on the things that we can control and ignore
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   most of the things that we can't control for our own mental health. And so I've been doing
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.760]   that with regard to this particular crime in Las Vegas.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.880]   When analyzing an event like this, I think it's important to stay focused on the fact
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.600]   that you can't build your day-to-day life on black swan events. It's important to consider
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.840]   an event like this, but not to overreact. When there's an event that has heavy emotional
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.040]   weight, it's easy to allow the event to take on an outsized influence in our thinking and
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.240]   not to analyze it rationally and logically. So I recommend that you study the event carefully,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.280]   learn the lessons that you can apply to your own life, but not let a very statistically
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.120]   improbable event deeply control your actions and your behaviors. Be careful to respond
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.520]   appropriately, but not to overreact. Speaking broadly and statistically, the likelihood
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.120]   of your ever being involved in an active shooter event, such as the Las Vegas massacre, is
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:57.240]   extremely, extremely small. The likelihood is increasing, and I think it's worth your
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:06.240]   taking seriously, but it is extremely small. You are far more likely to die from a heart
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:15.400]   attack due to poor health than from an active shooter targeting you when you're attending
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.680]   some sort of outdoor music concert. So if your heart health is not in tune or not on
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.400]   track, it's better for you to spend more time focusing on increasing the health of
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.580]   your heart than preparing for an active shooter scenario.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.000]   Another reason why the Las Vegas event is very difficult to use as a model is it's
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.400]   an event that is unlike any other active shooter scenario that I've personally studied. It
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.040]   was a unique event with an impossible tactical layout from the perspective of any kind of
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:03.120]   defense or any kind of – well, defense. So in this situation, all of the old discussions
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.080]   about, "Well, if you had a handgun on your hip, you could defend yourself," none of
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.360]   that applies in this situation. I'm convinced that given the particular unique situation
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.760]   of this specific event, you could put three or four squads of Marines armed with heavy
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.940]   machine guns in the middle of that crowd and they would have been in every bit as much
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:33.080]   danger as everyone else who was unarmed. This was a unique event with an awful tactical
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.440]   situation. It's a miracle that the event was resolved as quickly as it was and with
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.400]   as little loss of life as it had.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.880]   Now that's my analysis just simply from an external untrained perspective, just simply
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.720]   looking at it and considering the tactical situation of – it's incredible. Now time
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.920]   will tell when the full after-action reports are done by the appropriate police departments,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.960]   et cetera. More details will emerge in time. So let's talk about what you can do. I'll
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.720]   just lead with what makes sense to me and then I'll give you some other suggestions
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.520]   of things that I have changed in the past when it comes to events like these.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.440]   For me, this particular event has spurred and kind of pushed me forward to recognize
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.000]   the value of taking some medical training. I've generally ignored medical training.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.920]   I've never had any formal medical training as have most of us. Perhaps we know some basics
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.080]   of how to put a band-aid on and how to keep a cut clean in hopes of avoiding infection.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.120]   Perhaps we've practiced the Heimlich maneuver or we've had a simple CPR class somewhere.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.160]   But I've never really done much beyond that when it comes to medical training.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.760]   Looking at the scenario there in Las Vegas, it really brought home to me how valuable
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.060]   it would be for me to have some more basic – some more understanding of how to deal
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:06.840]   with a disaster, a disaster zone like that. Now from all of my understanding, it seems
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.760]   like dealing with bleeding, especially with gunshot wounds, things like that, that dealing
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.360]   with that is largely a matter of stop the bleeding, which the primary tool in my understanding
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.520]   of stopping the bleeding is to use pressure to do anything you can to stop the bleeding.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.760]   But still, I've recognized, you know what? I'd like to be a little bit more competent
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.760]   when it comes to medical training. When I put myself in that situation as a victim and
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.920]   I imagine myself there with maybe my wife or my children or some friends that we were
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.040]   with at a concert got shot and I think how utterly helpless I would feel if I had nothing,
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.520]   if I had no tools, nothing associated with that, no training to deal with that and I'm
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.680]   just sitting there as a sitting duck watching one of my family members bleed out, then I
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.440]   don't want to be in that situation.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.920]   So for me, I'm going to personally investigate taking advantage of some medical training
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:06.880]   and I'm also going to personally consider and try to see – assess the viability of
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.720]   carrying some basic medical equipment. For example, a lot of people will carry a tourniquet
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.200]   with them whenever possible. A tourniquet in my understanding can make a huge difference
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.880]   when somebody has been shot, when there's major blood loss, a tourniquet can potentially
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.560]   be a life-saving device.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.840]   Now that's me. That may ring true with you. Maybe you want to consider doing that as well.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:33.000]   I think it raises – I can see the approach and I can see the value of having some additional
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.480]   medical training and perhaps having some better medical supplies to help sustain life until
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.600]   a paramedic can arrive in a situation like that.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   But here are a few other things that I've focused a lot on over the years that I hope
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.920]   will be practical to you.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   The biggest thing that makes a difference in my study and analysis of these types of
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.760]   events is paying attention, having good awareness of the situation that's happening around
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.240]   you. In our modern world, it's my observation that very few of us spend time paying attention
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.640]   to the things that are around us. There has been an increase in people being hit by cars
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.720]   over the past years as people have become engrossed in their cell phones and people
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.200]   just wander out in the street and get hit by cars. I think we could all relate to that.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   It's common that sometimes I'll be doing something on my phone and I'll completely
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.160]   just miss out on what's going on if somebody is speaking to me or if I'm involved in
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.680]   something else and I'll just blank out on the circumstances that are happening around.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.480]   We all know the impact of texting and driving or doing something on our phone while driving
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.960]   and how dangerous that is and what a major impact that can make and can shorten your
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   life.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.840]   Hopefully, you've taken steps to avoid texting and driving or avoid Facebooking and driving
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.520]   or avoid surfing the web and driving, avoiding all of those kinds of things. Hopefully, you've
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.400]   taken steps to control that. That's a major risk factor in your life and it's stupid
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.600]   to be committed to something like, "I don't drink and drive," but then to allow yourself
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.400]   to text and drive. It's dumb.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.900]   Hopefully, you've done that. Frequently, when you're out and about in a public situation,
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:17.760]   if you just pay attention, oftentimes a few extra seconds of reaction time can make a
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.040]   difference. It's a good idea. Don't have the earbuds in your ears or if you're going
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.880]   to be listening to something, don't listen in both ears. Keep your head up when you're
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.640]   out in public. Look around. There are old tricks, of course, things that I do and I
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.200]   hope that I think are simple. I always try, for example, when I go in a restaurant, I
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.720]   always try to sit with my back to the wall so I can see what's going on in the restaurant
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.040]   and not be taken by surprise by something.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.160]   Those are simple things that you can do that don't cost anything financially. They don't
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:52.520]   cost anything in terms of lifestyle, just simple tricks that you can do and take advantage
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.120]   of so that you pay attention. Oftentimes, if you can pay attention in a situation, then
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.220]   you can have a little bit of advance notice. So train yourself and be diligent about paying
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.480]   attention to the circumstances that are around you.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.680]   Now, this wouldn't, of course, apply to the Las Vegas scenario, but many times you can
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:17.160]   sense when trouble is starting to brew. If you think about a riot or a political rally
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.440]   that's going to turn violent, etc., you can start to sense a change in the crowd. When
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.760]   that happens, leave. If you sense trouble or if the hackles on the back of your neck
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.840]   go up and you start to sense that you might be in a dangerous situation, people are looking
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.880]   sideways at you and you start to feel uncomfortable, leave. Pay attention to that sense that you
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.200]   have and get out of the situation.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.460]   Now, in just a moment, we'll talk about paying attention in the context of the Las Vegas
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:50.440]   event and possibly how that could have helped. Another suggestion I have for you, something
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.240]   that I have made the change in in past years is when you're out and about and you're
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.640]   in a circumstance where you may wind up involved in something like this, you're out at a
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:05.120]   market, you're at a concert, etc., make sure that you always wear good footwear. I
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.160]   became convinced of this. Now, maybe you don't think about this, but in Florida, I've
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.680]   practically lived in flip-flops for the last decade. I've worn flip-flops constantly.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.940]   It's kind of just part of the normal thing. I've gone out and I'll go out and walk
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.200]   miles in flip-flops. I've climbed up mountains in flip-flops. So I'm just accustomed to
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.760]   wearing flip-flops. And flip-flops work really well when you just need to walk, but they
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:35.960]   don't necessarily work all that well when you need to do something other than walk.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:42.840]   Last year, last July, just over a year ago, when terrorists drove a truck into crowds
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   of people at the Bastille Day celebration in Nice, France, I really paid attention to
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:57.280]   that one. That guy killed 86 people and injured 458 other people in addition to the 86 who
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.900]   died. So he killed 86 people and injured 458 people before he was shot by the police. Just
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.780]   incredible damage and incredible havoc. When I looked at that and analyzed that situation
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.420]   for myself, I realized that I wouldn't want to be caught in that type of situation and
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.860]   not be able to run, not be able to move. And for me, my life has changed. When I was single,
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.700]   I always considered that it was relatively simple and easy for me to move and to run.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.700]   I could probably run and get away in flip-flops. But then I recognized that now I have the
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:35.820]   charge of three small children and my wife, and I have a responsibility to protect them.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:41.020]   And if I need to scoop up three children and move because there's a truck barreling through
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.020]   a crowd at me and I'm desperate to get out of the way, I don't want to be wearing flip-flops
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.580]   in that circumstance.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.660]   And when I looked at the video and watched the video from the Las Vegas shooting, I had
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:59.620]   kind of a similar response. If you're ever facing somebody who's shooting at you, your
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:06.660]   most effective defense is almost always going to be to run, to run and get away from there.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:13.780]   There's this popular mythology that you're guaranteed to be shot if you're confronted
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:19.660]   by somebody with a gun and people tend to wilt and melt down in fear with somebody with
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.680]   a gun. But if you actually start studying gunfights, you find out that it's incredible
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.580]   oftentimes in a gunfight how few bullets actually land on a person's body during a gunfight.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:36.100]   You can study the police statistics of how many rounds a police officer commonly will
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.940]   fire in a gunfight and how few will actually connect with the person they're shooting at.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.580]   Now when you take that and you add additional stress and additional problems and additional
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:52.780]   energy, if you run, you can be pretty confident of your being able to get away or at least
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:15:00.340]   sustain less of a serious mortal wound if you're facing a gunfight. There's a popular
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.940]   shirt in the military community that snipers like – or a slogan, "If you run, you'll
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.460]   only die tired." Well, that may be true if you're facing a professional, calm, cool,
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.300]   collected military sniper. But we're not talking about that. Most of the time when
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:20.620]   you're dealing with an active shooter, you're dealing with somebody who is obviously a criminal
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.580]   but you're dealing with somebody who isn't – is probably not going to be trained and
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.360]   is probably not going to be all that effective.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.920]   Many people who are trained and experienced with guns can't effectively hit a moving
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:40.180]   target and many criminals, most criminals are terrible gun handlers who are unused to
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:47.020]   handling their weapons, who are terrible at – terrible shots. If you are running and
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.780]   if you're moving, it's very hard to hit a moving target with a firearm. But it's
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.420]   hard to run if you don't have decent shoes.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.820]   Now, when you think back to the video of the Las Vegas event, my observation about the
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.740]   only thing I could think of to do tactically in that situation is to run and figure out
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:11.620]   – it's hard to know what direction to run in but you want to do everything you can to
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:17.980]   run. The only two solutions if you're being fired at is to find cover, something that
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.460]   would adequately stop bullets that are coming at you. That was hard to do, not a whole lot
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.660]   of cover when you're in a crowd of people in an open scenario or to run.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:33.000]   Of course, running is hard. Best if you can find some kind of back exit or something away
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.560]   from the crowds. But at least if you're moving, there's less of a chance of your
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:43.300]   being shot. It's easy to overestimate the risk if you're in a situation like this.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:49.080]   Remember this. In a crowd of – my understanding, a crowd of about – of over 20,000 people,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:57.660]   some say 22,000 people at a concert, horrifically, 58 people are dead. You run the math on 58
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:04.100]   people out of 22,000, you got a pretty decent chance of survival there. 58 people out of
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:12.740]   22,000 is like 0.0026 percent. That's – I think if I can do my conversions right from
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.780]   decimal to fractions, that's about a quarter of 1 percent chance of dying from a gunshot
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.780]   wound.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.260]   Now notice another 400 or 450 people were shot. But so far, there have been significant
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:30.340]   numbers of survivors. People often overestimate the chances of dying when it comes to a gunshot
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:36.220]   wound. There are case after case after case after case of people receiving multiple gunshot
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.660]   wounds and living.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:44.520]   So just simply being shot is not a death sentence. Now if you're shot in certain places or
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.060]   in certain ways, of course it is. Tragically, there are obviously 58 people that are dead
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.900]   at this point in time. But being shot, it's in and of itself is not a death sentence.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:59.260]   So you want to do anything you can to minimize the chance of getting hit or if you are going
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.140]   to get a hit, you want to do anything you can to minimize the chance of it being an
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.620]   easy shot or of taking multiple shots.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.860]   Your best solution is to run. It's hard to run if you're not wearing good shoes.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.620]   So I know one of the changes that I've made in my life is I've determined that when
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.780]   I go out in public, I'm going to wear decent shoes. Again, I felt the responsibility of
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.900]   protecting my family pretty heavily. That's a big one for me. That may or may not apply
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.140]   to you.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.260]   But consider especially if you're going to a place where there are crowds of people,
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:34.180]   crowds of people who have been disarmed, then it's a higher risk profile, higher target
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.180]   and you should pay attention to that.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:43.020]   Next practical suggestion, something that I have also changed over the years is I think
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.820]   it's a good idea to always carry a flashlight. This wouldn't have made much of a difference
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:56.460]   in Las Vegas in terms of you're not going to flash a light at somebody's eyes who's
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.380]   32 stories up. But a lot of times in other scenarios, this does make a difference. In
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:07.740]   Las Vegas, perhaps it would have made a difference if you're trying to escape that you can get
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.780]   out and there's a dark hallway or something like that and you have a flashlight so you
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.420]   can point it down the hallway to be able to see out.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.060]   Or perhaps it would have made a difference if you were trying to care for a friend or
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.900]   just someone else who had gotten shot that you had a light that you could actually see
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.280]   so you could see where they were bleeding and see to try to apply pressure and stop
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.820]   the bleeding, something like that. I think it's a good idea to carry a flashlight and
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.380]   there are many tactical situations in which a flashlight can make a big, big difference.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.360]   You're crossing a dark parking lot, leaving your office late at night, somebody comes
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:47.940]   up to see you, a strong bright blinding flashlight can incapacitate somebody for enough time
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:54.860]   for you to turn and run and get away. A strong bright blinding flashlight can make a major
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:20:01.020]   difference in some kind of active shooter scenario. Think back to the guy that shot
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.620]   up the movie theater in Colorado a few years ago. A strong flashlight to be able to shine
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.940]   their eyes and hopefully have a weapon as well. But a strong flashlight to shine an
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.340]   eyes can make a big difference. I think back to the Pulse nightclub shooting when there's
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.700]   confusion all around and chaos all around, the flashlight to be able to see what's going
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.380]   on and get you and some other people out as long as you're not targeted can make a big,
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.500]   big difference. There are so many great flashlights now that are small, that are bright, that
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.980]   are easy to carry. I recommend it. I think one of the things that you find is if you
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.140]   actually carry a flashlight, is you find it useful in more circumstances than not. I think
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.620]   most of us have gotten so used to frequently using the flashlights on our phone. Now that
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.100]   the phones are built where we can just basically automatically turn on the light on the back,
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:52.660]   we find how useful that is. Well, they are useful, but an actual standalone proper flashlight
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:21:01.300]   is many times far more useful. One that I carry is a tiny little light called a 4/7
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:08.380]   Mini Mark II. This is a neat little flashlight. It's about the size of my thumb. A little
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.020]   bit smaller, a little bit shorter than my thumb. So just a tiny little thing, but it's
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:19.300]   got multiple modes. It's got a turbo mode, which is unbelievably powerful for a tiny
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.740]   little flashlight. It's incredibly powerful, incredibly bright. That can be useful in a
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.820]   scenario that you need a really bright flashlight. But then it's also got, of course, a high,
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.500]   medium, low, but then it's got this tiny little, they call it a moonlight mode, that's very,
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.760]   very dim. I find that I use that all the time. I go into my children's rooms to look at them
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.340]   at night before I go to bed and check on them, make sure everything's good. I use that little
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:51.180]   just very dim flashlight constantly. So I think a flashlight is a very useful thing
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.820]   for you to consider having. Always take a few minutes when you're in a scenario, when
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:01.860]   you're in a concert, church building, movie theater, etc. Always take a few minutes when
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.700]   you sit down to do the same thing you do on an airplane. Look around and try to figure
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.300]   out where your closest exits are and think through, "Okay, if I need to get out of here,
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.740]   if there's a fire, if there's a shooter, if there's a violent incident, if I need to get
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:19.080]   out of here, where is my closest exit?" And keep in mind that the closest exit may be
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.660]   behind you. So when you sit down on an airplane, you always take a moment and look around,
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.540]   find out where the exits are. Make that a regular practice for yourself. If you sit
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.780]   down in a restaurant, if you sit down in a movie theater, look around and look for the
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:38.580]   exits. We have kind of a common tendency often to just think about one way. We think about
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.060]   the way that we came in and it takes a little bit of training, a little bit of practice
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:49.220]   to think about looking around for other exits. But that can be very, very helpful if there's
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.180]   a scenario you need to get out.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:56.740]   And then my final comment I guess would be in most situations, if you have an opportunity,
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:04.180]   if you can't run or if running doesn't seem like the right move, fight like crazy. To
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.460]   be very clear, this doesn't apply to the Las Vegas scenario. That was shooting fish
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:16.100]   in a barrel. The guy had an incredible tactical position, high ground, no cover for the people
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:21.620]   down below. There was no way to fight him from down below. Nothing, nothing, no fighting
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:31.540]   whatsoever. But remember, that is not normal. A much more normal incident, much more normal
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   incident with a shooter is probably more like that guy who attacked the church in Antioch,
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:42.580]   Tennessee last week. The guy goes in, starts shooting in the church, shoots a woman in
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.980]   the parking lot, starts shooting other people in the building and then was attacked. And
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.460]   it seems to be – although we're still waiting on details from the investigation
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:58.060]   – it seems to be that when the guy was attacked, he wound up shooting himself.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.020]   Now whether it was intentional or unintentional, meaning whether he intended to take his own
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.680]   life or whether it was an unintentional shot where he shot himself due to the surprise
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:14.020]   of being attacked is unknown. But it wouldn't surprise me if he shot himself simply because
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.820]   he was attacked. Many of these shooters have no training, no training with a firearm. And
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:27.980]   if you can do something to disrupt their ability to shoot, disrupt their – just their flow,
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.180]   their rhythm, you may have a chance.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.980]   Many of these guys are cowards. They're planning to shoot themselves and as soon as
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:41.660]   there's a little bit of resistance and somebody able to fight back, then they shoot themselves.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:47.300]   So you can't overestimate – don't underestimate the power of fighting back. Fight back. If
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.540]   you can't run, if you can't get out of there, fight back and fight like crazy with
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.500]   anything that you can.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:59.420]   If you need to throw a chair or throw – what was it? Beer steins like the guy in London
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.300]   when the terrorists attacked there recently. If you need to throw beer glasses at a guy,
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:09.460]   throw beer glasses. Hopefully have a gun. Shoot back if you can. Figure out a way to
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.500]   fight back. Whatever tools you have, use them.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.340]   So these are just a few ideas that occurred to me, some changes that I've made in past
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.740]   years. Every time there's been an event, I've tried to look at it, think about it
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:28.060]   practically, not overreact. Not overreact to a small incident. Again, remember not to
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:35.780]   diminish the value of the people who are dead. But statistically speaking, very, very unlikely
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.820]   that you'll be involved in a scenario like this.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.460]   Even if you're one of the 22,000 people, statistically you have a very high chance
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:50.380]   of survival. So don't overreact. But do consider how you can respond. If there's
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:55.900]   anything in what I have shared with you that sparked something for you, just wearing decent
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:01.940]   footwear, paying attention when you're out and about, these things are simple. It's
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:08.540]   not as sexy as talking about, "Listen, here's the latest, greatest way that you
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:14.100]   can carry a firearm into a concert." In this round, all that stuff rings hollow in
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.540]   this particular event because none of it would have helped. But perhaps these other things
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:23.860]   would have. I don't know. I'm guessing just as you are. But think it through and
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.060]   do your best to learn from the event.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:33.540]   I guess my closing comments on this would be simple. Use the reminder to make sure that
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:40.620]   you are buying up the time that you have today. None of us knows our last day on earth. None
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:47.260]   of us know. Personally, as this particular event was horrific, I'm thankful it wasn't
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:53.460]   worse. When I look at the pictures of the situation, I'm thankful it wasn't worse.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:27:00.500]   And it's not the worst that we'll see in the future. I've thought through some
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.700]   of the different – if I were a terrorist and I wanted to inflict terror upon the US
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.100]   American people, I've thought through some of the different things that could be done.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.220]   And it's the kind of thing that I'll never say any of those things out loud. You don't
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:23.940]   want to give people ideas. But when smart people want to inflict terror on other people,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:29.620]   there are – there is an incredible number of ways in which we individually are vulnerable,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:35.300]   in which we collectively as a society are vulnerable. And a mass shooting is just the
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:41.780]   tip of the iceberg. Who knows what the future holds? I'm thankful the police were able
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:46.980]   to respond as quickly as they did. I think in the final analysis, the Las Vegas SWAT
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:53.980]   teams are going to really be worthy of strong commendation for their response. Considering
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:28:00.380]   the situation, I think it's remarkable that more people weren't killed. I think we can
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.700]   all be thankful for that. We've been praying for the families of those who were killed
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:11.980]   here in my family, which is heartbreaking. When you come face to face with pure evil,
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:19.020]   it makes me very thankful that God is a God of justice and that he has promised to take
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:27.960]   vengeance on all evil. And I shudder to think of the circumstances that this particular
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.100]   killer is facing. Jesus said in preaching to the people in the book of Matthew, Jesus
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:38.860]   said, "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:47.340]   who can destroy both soul and body in hell." I think much of the time we shrink from wanting
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:55.020]   to think or talk about hell and the many people who will spend eternity in hell. But I think
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:01.780]   it touches our emotions where when we look at pure evil and pure horror on a mass scale,
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.580]   I think those times we're thankful that there's a God of justice who is the final
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.860]   arbiter of right and wrong. And I think in those circumstances, I'm always thankful
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.540]   that I don't have to be the one to sentence someone to eternal damnation, but that God
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:22.780]   does. Hope these thoughts are useful for you and we're back with more regular personal
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.500]   finance content soon.
