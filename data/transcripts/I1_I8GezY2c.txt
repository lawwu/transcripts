[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   why do you think men struggle with monogamy so much more than women i think they just have
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.200]   so many options and it's so easy and i feel like women too we kind of did ourselves a disgrace
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.320]   because here you are accepting and willingly being that side bitch and making it so easy
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.360]   that you ruin it for everybody and they think it's like something to be proud of it's disgusting
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.480]   you can't lie that's not natural excuse me you don't think so it clearly ain't that unnatural
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560]   if it's evolved to this place but it's evolved don't you think that's from a place of men doing
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.400]   it so women try to go against their natural i feel like you know there was a point in time women
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.160]   before us they had no rights this is the most freedom we as women have had collectively in
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.960]   just career invisibility and using our voices and being in prominent spaces so i feel like
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.040]   i think it's more disgusting for a woman to be like that no
