[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   We often talk about on our show this idea of the deep life
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.200]   where you intentionally craft an ideal image
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.060]   of what your life is like,
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.760]   what all the different attributes are,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.600]   the values, your day-to-day experience,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.400]   and then you work backwards to get there.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.580]   For a lot of people, work is not at the center of that.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.000]   So what they're looking for is work that they enjoy
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.960]   that also gives them financial flexibility,
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.800]   that gives them the autonomy to help fulfill
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.880]   maybe a more remarkable vision of their life.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880]   And so what we wanna learn from you today
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.840]   is we're gonna learn a lot about the reality,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.640]   the myths and the reality of trying to create
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.100]   a flexible, autonomous business that really is successful
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.880]   but is not the all-consuming,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.960]   we have huge venture capital investment
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.240]   and the lights are on all night.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.480]   How do we find that sweet spot
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.880]   of entrepreneurship unlocking depth?
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.400]   So first of all, is my premise gonna match,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.080]   am I correct in saying that my,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.040]   the premise matches what I've read in your book?
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.920]   Are we gonna be on the same,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.060]   we're on the same wavelength here?
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.080]   - Yeah, the only thing I would call out is
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.920]   you can build Facebook in a weekend.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.760]   It was actually started in a weekend.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.800]   And Airbnb, I think you mentioned that too,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.400]   that also started in a weekend with just an email.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.040]   And it doesn't take people that have PhDs to do that.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.880]   There's also a lot of ordinary companies and businesses.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.620]   And I think to your original premise,
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.460]   that's exactly right,
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.200]   where you can start something really quickly,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.600]   which people find surprising and is a common myth you can't,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.160]   and create these amazing dream lives.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.080]   And really, through entrepreneurship, find out who you are.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.000]   And that's been the biggest surprise
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.940]   and amazement for myself.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.400]   - So what, before we get into what works,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.840]   what is it that people, people like me get wrong,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.640]   but like me, I mean, we're navel gazing,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.060]   we over rationalize, we don't take action,
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.240]   we draw out like a 17 step plan,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.520]   like I'm gonna figure out,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.160]   when we think about using entrepreneurship
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.720]   to unlock more options in our life,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.680]   what do people like me, what are the traps?
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.920]   What do we get, what have you seen we get wrong?
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.220]   - So the first trap is the certificate life.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.000]   - I have a lot of those, Noah.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.320]   (laughing)
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.240]   - I only have one.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.760]   I'm like so ashamed to even talk to you.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.120]   I only went to one college with, I did get two majors,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.640]   but my brother's a doctor.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.480]   - That's two more than Mark Zuckerberg though, right?
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.040]   He has no major, so it's all, let's be honest,
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.880]   it's all relative.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.520]   - That's true, that's true.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.120]   And I think certificate life, my brother's a doctor
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.360]   and he graduated and he's got hundreds of thousands of debt
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.520]   and he's like, damn it, you didn't have any debt
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760]   and you like just started stuff and now you're rich
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400]   and I'm having to stuck to this nine to five thing
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.640]   that I don't really care for all the time.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.600]   And what's interesting about it
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.840]   is that you don't need a certificate
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.080]   to succeed in life anymore.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.760]   I think if you wanna do certain things like be a doctor,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.400]   probably need a certificate,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.600]   but there's just such a cool life
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.800]   regardless if you follow that path or not.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.720]   And I think that's just something
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.320]   that people think they need permission for
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.300]   or they need to get certified and you just don't,
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.640]   which is so amazing.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.880]   - Just to jump in real quick,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.840]   would you say certificate life also really biases you
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.720]   towards trading time for money, which can become a trap,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.040]   especially for more remarkable things.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.820]   So that's just the path there.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.400]   I'm a doctor, I'm trading my time for money.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.360]   I'm a lawyer, I'm trading my time for money,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.000]   which can only get you so far
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300]   because you have to up stress up income.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.140]   - You can.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.600]   I mean, I think that that's also another myth
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   of trading time for money.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.120]   You can trade your money for someone else's time though
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.160]   at some point.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.640]   I think that people don't realize that like,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.140]   all right, well, I'm getting paid $1,000 an hour.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.700]   Why don't I pay someone 500 bucks an hour
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.320]   and I'll pay for their time to go do that work
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.560]   and make 500 bucks on it.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.200]   That's entrepreneurship.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.600]   And everyone out there, if you haven't hired an assistant,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.660]   I recommend a site called hiremymom.com
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.620]   or if you hire like a house cleaner.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.600]   Those are practices of how am I using money
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.180]   to have time to either make more of it
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.840]   or frankly just chill and spend time doing the things
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.940]   you really wanna enjoy.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.120]   So a lot of times when you go to college
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.780]   and you're taught to stay in the lane,
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.560]   like I grew up in the middle-class lane
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.680]   and the middle-class lane loves health insurance.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.560]   - They're very worried about health insurance.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.200]   - Very worried about health insurance.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.360]   My parents are terrified.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.080]   Like when I was at Intel, I worked at a cubicle,
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.720]   just very standard, like most people,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.360]   like I didn't know how people figured out their careers.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.300]   And when I was leaving to go to this little company
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.720]   called Facebook, they're like,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.960]   you're leaving health insurance?
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.120]   You are crazy, my friend.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.240]   I was like, Facebook has health insurance, don't worry.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.880]   So number one, I think that just the reality
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.680]   that you don't need permission to be successful
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.480]   in these areas, you can do it anywhere.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.360]   Like there's no physical discrimination.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.120]   Like you can be short and succeed in business.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.760]   You could be looking any color, any gender and succeed.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.960]   And I think that's really cool.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.800]   That's amazing.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.560]   Like what other things in this world
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.960]   can ordinary people succeed like that?
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.680]   Like you can't do it in no sports, excuse me.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.880]   - Yeah, that's for sure, right?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.540]   Yeah, you can't be a basketball player
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.800]   just because you want to.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   - But you can be an entrepreneurship if you want to.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.000]   And the beauty is that you can start it today.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.960]   And that's one of the things I tell people
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.520]   to do it right now, like today, don't worry how it works.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.040]   And I think that sometimes people are too smart, right?
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.960]   And a lot of non-smart people have a lot of success as well
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.400]   just 'cause they get started.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.840]   - Yeah.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.700]   - And so they're realizing like, huh, what could I do today?
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.400]   Especially if maybe you're an educated,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.120]   significantly educated person,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.680]   maybe you're good at research.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   That's a cool business to do.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.760]   Maybe you have expertise in certain areas.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.280]   That's a cool business.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.360]   And realizing you can actually get those things
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.500]   going a lot quicker than you realize
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.280]   and cheaper than you expect
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.480]   is kind of as an eye-opener for most people
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.140]   when they think it's supposed to be this hard,
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.480]   complicated, long process,
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.680]   similar to the education maybe they've had.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.900]   - So if that's the first trap,
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.300]   that they just don't think it's possible,
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.040]   what's the, what happens for those,
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.600]   what goes wrong when someone says, you know what?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.280]   I'm convinced and I'm just gonna, I'm gonna jump into it.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.960]   And then it goes awry.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.060]   So when you see the cases of like,
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.960]   okay, I'm quitting my job, let's rock and roll.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.000]   My business is gonna kill it and it doesn't.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.640]   What's tripping people up there as well
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.100]   for those who like the idea of making the move
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.580]   but maybe don't think it through
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.080]   or have the evidence, what goes wrong?
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.560]   - Well, I always thought risky was having a day job.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.600]   And I never think that it has to be this big thing
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.060]   that you like quit your job and try this thing
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.900]   and it has to work.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.500]   It's gonna take time and it doesn't work.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.900]   Like I've tried 20 businesses
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.540]   to finally get to the one AppSumo over a decade
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.220]   that eventually worked but you gotta keep trying
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.060]   and trying and trying and starting.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.820]   Like there's a story in college.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.160]   I went to Cal and I had a history of economics class
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.320]   and I was like, you know, I'm smart.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.520]   I didn't try very hard on this midterm.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.120]   And I got a C plus, I've never got a C plus.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.420]   I was like a 3.8 GPA, I was really proud of myself.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.440]   And I go to the teacher and I was like,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.280]   how did I get a C plus?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.680]   She's like, well, you didn't try that hard.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.720]   You didn't really put in the work.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.400]   And I was like, you're right.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.240]   Yeah, I tried to just get by doing minimal work
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.560]   for maximum return.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.040]   That's how I got to Berkeley.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.580]   And, but it was great and when you think about that story,
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.380]   it made me recognize, okay, well, yeah,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.940]   I didn't put in the work and that's okay.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.140]   Let me go put in the work and see what happens.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.220]   And I ended up getting, I think a B plus in that class
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.300]   and it was just more of the valuable lesson.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.540]   And that same thing applies in business.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.500]   It's not gonna work right away.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.740]   And all of these failures, you're a professor.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.340]   You know, when you're doing professing
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.300]   or you're doing new ideas, you have hypothesis
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.580]   and then you test them.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.620]   So think of yourself as an experimenter or a scientist
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.720]   and you experiment on these things.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.920]   Like I wanted to try a business blogging today
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.160]   or I wanted to try this weekend doing a research business
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.760]   or this weekend I wanted to try a consulting business.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   Hmm, that's my hypothesis.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.600]   It failed.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.680]   Okay, what did I learn from that?
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.760]   And now I'm gonna use that
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.000]   in my next experiment next weekend.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.460]   And all these failures are actually getting you closer
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.560]   to where you wanna be.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.980]   So looking at them as more positives
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.980]   and what am I growing out of this experience
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.820]   versus I would say most people,
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.900]   like look at YouTube or podcasts as a great example,
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.100]   they do one show and they stop.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.540]   And there's really no difference
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.660]   between the people who win and succeed
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.280]   except the winners really,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.780]   besides finding something people want,
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.740]   they stick with it.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.800]   - Yeah, see, I love this idea
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.340]   because I think people get this wrong.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.380]   I've seen this even myself
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.280]   is when it comes to doing something
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.580]   that has an interesting or desirable reward
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.300]   like a business that takes off and is successful,
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.500]   they're hard to find.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.560]   You have to explore the space of the adjacent possible,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.740]   right, so new ideas that are possible
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.260]   that build on things that exist before,
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.720]   and it's hard to find what actually works,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.540]   but too often, this is what I think about people I know
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.420]   who have failed at entrepreneurship,
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.880]   when they're looking at case studies,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.260]   they don't realize that you're seeing a sampling
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.940]   of how many tries it took to succeed.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.980]   So a lot of people,
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.400]   the average might be seven or eight businesses,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.180]   but you're like, let's look at the tail.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.080]   So like Mark Zuckerberg's first idea or second idea,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.900]   that did really well.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.460]   Steve Jobs' second idea,
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.580]   oh, so my first site, that's how it works.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.780]   Hey there, I wanna take a quick moment
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.660]   to tell you about my new book,
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.520]   "Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.000]   Without Burnout."
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.980]   If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel,
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.360]   you're really gonna like this book.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.260]   It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.800]   combined with step-by-step instructions
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.220]   for putting it into action.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.820]   Now, if you pre-order this book before it comes out
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.620]   on March 5th,
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.860]   I have some bonuses I wanna offer you
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.700]   as my way of saying thanks.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.380]   These include a chapter-by-chapter audio commentary
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.620]   from me, the author,
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.100]   and a crash course that will teach you
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.420]   how to put the ideas of slow productivity into action
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.240]   in your own life right away.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.120]   So to find out more about the book
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.880]   and how to redeem your pre-order bonuses,
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.820]   check out calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.040]   Everything you need, you can find there.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.800]   All right, thanks, let's get back to it.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.320]   You come up with an idea, and if it's good enough,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.640]   it's really successful.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.280]   And if it's not, then you shouldn't be an entrepreneur,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.560]   so you might as well go all in.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.400]   Where you're saying,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.380]   which is my experience from academia, by the way,
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.560]   researchers, you're always exploring this adjacent possibility.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.280]   We publish a lot of papers,
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.400]   'cause you're trying to seek
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.200]   what's really going to take off,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.720]   what's really gonna change the field.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.540]   If you knew it in advance,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.220]   you would only need like three researchers.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.440]   They could just write, here we go.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.660]   This is like the paper we need this year.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.620]   So I love this mindset.
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.200]   But then that means though, if exploration is key,
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.820]   you probably shouldn't be making the really grandiose,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.360]   I'm just gonna quit everything.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.880]   This first idea, our mortgage depends on,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.980]   it's definitely gonna work tomorrow.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.140]   You need to have more of an experimentalist mindset.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.480]   That seems like a shift for a lot of people.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.980]   - It is, and I've seen this in Million Dollar Weekend,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.420]   where people realize it could be fun.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.440]   And again, it doesn't have to be this big, scary monster,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.500]   like, oh, I've got to make all this money.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.360]   It's like, can you get one customer today?
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.560]   Really, just one, yeah.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.820]   Or can you do one thing
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.100]   that you're maybe a little bit afraid of
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.560]   and realizing that the life you want to live and engineer
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.620]   is just on that a little bit
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.920]   of that other side of discomfort.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.880]   And I'm seeing it,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.680]   like there's a guy who read Million Dollar Weekend,
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.260]   and he emailed me and he's like,
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.600]   yeah, I read the book
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.120]   and I just went and did stand up this week.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.800]   I was like, go you.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.640]   And he's like, wow,
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.940]   I didn't realize there's so much more I can do.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.680]   And I think that's been almost the interesting part
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.560]   of entrepreneurship about it being fun,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.340]   but also finding out who you can really become
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.900]   and who you are
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.420]   and realizing it's actually accessible to everyone.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.700]   I think there's this intimidation that,
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.340]   oh, I'm not a business person.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.180]   I'm not that.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.620]   It's like, great, embrace that.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.780]   How do we take that?
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.620]   And what I think,
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.660]   especially if you're an academic or if you're at a day job,
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.940]   have you ever been fired, Cal?
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.840]   - I've never not been in academia.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.380]   My entire adult life.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.420]   Never not been in academia.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.180]   - Out in the non-academic world, we get fired.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.300]   I've been fired twice. - I don't know about this.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.700]   My ivory tower doesn't have this word.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.640]   We just have your tenure case was declined
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.740]   and then you very quietly leave academia
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.940]   and get a job in industry.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.160]   That's as close as we get to firing people.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.360]   - Yeah, when you've been fired,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.200]   you kind of realize like,
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.980]   oh wow, this one person decided my livelihood.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.820]   And I think entrepreneurship is a great way
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.240]   to explore creativity in a lot of different areas.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.780]   And if someone ever is saying like,
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.740]   hey, you're losing your mortgage payments
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.120]   and your food and all these things,
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.500]   like you at least have a backup plan
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.400]   and you can have both.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.240]   I think people are surprised.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.820]   I'm like, yeah, you can have both.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.620]   And it's such a fun outlet.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.660]   Like there's a woman who had a day job at Warby Parker.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.180]   You know that eyeglass company?
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.020]   - Sure.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.920]   - Yeah, and she was just like, her name is Mary
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.980]   and she dreamed of having her own business.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.520]   She's like, I don't want to wonder what if.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.460]   And I will say, if you want to engineer a great life,
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.940]   be an entrepreneur.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.060]   Like you can literally take off forever.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.620]   It has you get it going at some point.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.680]   You can literally just take off forever
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.460]   or you can live wherever you want.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.060]   Like I spent half the year in Spain.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.920]   And so this married woman wanted that life
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.700]   and it's accessible for her.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.020]   And she just sent an email to friends and family.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.660]   And I guess people want to make it complicated.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.420]   And there is more in the book that I break down
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.180]   exactly how you can do it with scripts and all these things.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.900]   But she sent an email to friends and family and said,
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.580]   hey, I've got this idea for greeting cards.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.860]   Does anyone want greeting cards?
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.220]   Just hit reply.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.780]   Fast forward in 2023, she sold $50,000 of greeting cards.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.980]   Wow.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.620]   And it's not-- that was not just one rich uncle bought
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.880]   a lot of greeting cards or I spent $50,000.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.800]   It's all-- and then you start realizing there's a process.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.580]   Just like there is an academia, you can create--
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.220]   there is a million dollar weekend process
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.340]   you can do over and over.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.060]   Then eventually you find something
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.300]   like that that does work.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.540]   And now she has $50,000 and I would be surprised this year
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.380]   if it's not a six figure business.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.540]   And now she's able-- she did actually quit her job
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.880]   and is now doing that full time.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.700]   Well, and I'm excited to get into this process.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.520]   Let me ask you to confirm something
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.680]   you changed my mind about.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.560]   And I want you to confirm if I got this right.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.180]   Your book changed my mind about this.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.020]   So something I've always noticed is
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.400]   that entrepreneurs seem to live cooler lives outside
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.180]   of their work too.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.820]   They tend to have more interesting hobbies
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.580]   or interest or the travel habits.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.540]   I always used to think that's just directly because they
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.820]   have flexibility and autonomy.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.940]   Like, oh, it's just hey, if you have more flexibility
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.700]   and autonomy, you're your own boss,
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.460]   you can finally go explore other things.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.700]   My new belief on this that I want to check with you,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.100]   that's part of it.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.660]   But it's also the entrepreneurial mindset
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.900]   is one that is open to, as you were just saying,
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.060]   why not try this?
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.620]   This could be really interesting.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.940]   Why don't we take up this sport?
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.260]   I don't know.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.060]   We live near the ocean.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.940]   What's surfing like?
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.700]   It's actually the mindset itself opens you more to--
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.780]   there's a lot in life.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.340]   What if?
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.500]   Let's try it.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.780]   It's a more open mindset.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:55.180]   So did I correctly have my mind changed by you on that one?
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.040]   Yes.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.060]   Yes, professor.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.140]   I would say so.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.260]   I mean, I think what I've noticed about entrepreneurs
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.380]   is they're willing to fail and then get feedback.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.140]   Just like when you do a paper, you submit a paper and research
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.180]   and then you get feedback and then you improve it.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.420]   And they're more willing to do that.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.300]   I'm more willing to do that because it's cool.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.020]   I get it better.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.460]   And you could do this in all aspects of your life.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.700]   And especially in business, that's
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.060]   how you can keep making your business better
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.980]   and better and better.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.680]   Hey, you didn't buy?
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.180]   How come?
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:20.860]   Hey, you did buy?
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:21.360]   How come?
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.020]   And then you make your product better and better and better.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.980]   The other thing I've noticed about entrepreneurs
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.940]   and successful people I admire is they're very curious.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.820]   And they're willing to be wrong with their curiosity, too.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.380]   So one of my best friends, Tynan--
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.100]   I think you're familiar with tynan.com.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.580]   He's here.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.740]   He's upstairs actually playing pinball right now.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.100]   [LAUGHS]
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.860]   And Tynan's just curious.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.300]   He's curious about this.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.740]   Yesterday, we were researching yachts
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.580]   that could cross the Atlantic.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.020]   But you don't need staff on them.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.780]   And they're solar paneled.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.940]   And it was just a fun curiosity to think, what if?
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.240]   And then I think that's part of the entrepreneurship thing.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.280]   You're curious about it.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.760]   And then you're like, maybe that can be a reality.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.060]   And then if you're wrong, you're OK with being wrong
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.660]   or change your mind.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.380]   If you're right, you're like, wow, that's amazing.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.660]   We could actually do that.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.300]   And I think that's probably outside of the certificate life
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.140]   where you're going outside maybe some of the lines that
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.640]   are set for what other people think.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.140]   Right.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.220]   And you and I were talking about this offline.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.500]   But there's a small group of us who
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.380]   are full-time just normal professors who also
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.500]   podcast for large audiences.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.660]   And no one understands what we do.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.460]   It's a constant-- the certificate world
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.260]   doesn't understand.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.220]   So if you get--
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.460]   I was just talking to Adam Grant about this yesterday.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.340]   He's in that club.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.780]   Huberman's in that club.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.540]   Our colleagues are like, what?
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.220]   What's-- is that-- can you publish this?
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.580]   How does this work?
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.380]   So you're right.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.720]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.040]   The certificate life is not--
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.100]   it does close off possibilities instinctually.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.740]   But OK, let's get into it now, though.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.540]   So now my odds are like, great, I want to now experiment.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.060]   And I understand that I don't have to quit my job tomorrow.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.760]   Because if I do, I'll lose my health insurance.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   And Noah's mom's going to get really mad at me.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.260]   And so no, I can have an experimentalist mindset to it.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.380]   What I love about the book is it's nuts and bolts,
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.500]   which I like.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.300]   And you build the conceit around roughly a weekend.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.380]   So you're trying to make it clear, don't take too long.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.220]   Let's go.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:18.980]   Let's get after it.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.780]   And you can right away experiment with an idea.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.180]   I like early on your idea of a freedom number
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.700]   as a source of courage or for inspiration.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.020]   You want to unpack that a little bit?
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.140]   Yeah, so the freedom number is the minimum number
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.300]   you need to actually do the things you want and live
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.420]   the life you want to live.
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.580]   And I have a best friend who works at Amazon.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.740]   Makes half a million dollars a year.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.240]   And it's very hard when you have a day job at that amount
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   because he's got a wife.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.940]   He's got a kid.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.700]   He's got obligations.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.420]   So that's why also in a weekend, because everyone's
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.900]   got at least an hour free in a weekend to change their life.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.780]   But the reality with the freedom number for him
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.280]   and for so many people why it's empowering is realizing,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.820]   all right, well, how much do I actually
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.180]   need to make if I start my own business
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.480]   to be able to go and work on the thing I like?
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.260]   Which turns out that actually is how you can make a lot of money.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.980]   And when you calculate it-- and I generally
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.600]   think it breaks down to the three areas, which
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.500]   is your savings, your living, and then entertainment.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.940]   And for me, when I was started, it was 3,000.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.100]   Now for my best friend, because he's got a family kid,
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.340]   mortgage is about 10,000.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.900]   And what's powerful and empowering about the freedom
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.220]   number is once you found yours-- and I encourage everyone
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.660]   to just write theirs down right now in their phone or on paper.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.180]   One, it's actually more attainable than people realize.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.700]   Like, huh, I only need--
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.420]   most people I've seen, depending on where
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.140]   they're at the stage of life, between 5,000.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.700]   I'm like, that's actually more reasonable than I thought.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.660]   And most people never become millionaires
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.300]   because they don't even make a dollar.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.180]   And now the other part of this is now that you're like, wow,
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.720]   that's not that hard to actually get to a monthly number.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.580]   The second thing is when you start businesses,
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.220]   it's not going to work right away.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.780]   And when it does start, you make your first dollar or $100
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.420]   in a weekend, you're like, well, dude, I make $20,000 a month
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.020]   or $10,000 a month or $5,000 a month already in my day job.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.660]   Like, this sucks.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.700]   It's like, hold on.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.360]   Like, this is the success part.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.820]   Even if you get one customer, which
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.360]   everyone can get three customers--
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.280]   I would recommend three customers or 48 hours.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.500]   And when you have this freedom number,
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   again, you're just realizing, like, wow, OK, so I can get it.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.660]   And maybe if I just stick with this for a little bit,
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.420]   maybe a year, two years, three years,
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.500]   you will get to that number, I promise you.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.740]   And if you see it getting closer, yeah, that motivates.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.620]   100%.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.920]   And for me, I am never this entrepreneur.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.500]   I know people are like, jump off cliffs
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.100]   without a parachute, which seems silly.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.060]   I don't know anyone who has ever done that.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.020]   I think that's like a silly maxim.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.020]   I think the reality for me is have your day job
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.020]   be your investor, create these side hustles,
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.140]   get to your freedom number, and then make the choice.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.220]   I even had someone recently who messaged me and was like,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.400]   I have a day job that I like, and I have a freedom number
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.220]   that I hit.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.460]   What do you think I should do?
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.180]   I was like, keep both.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.740]   You don't have to.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.460]   You don't have to make it binary.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.180]   Well, two points on this.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.660]   One is, I assume something people get wrong often
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.440]   with freedom numbers, 'cause I've seen this,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.560]   is they use the wrong heuristic, which is,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.720]   okay, what is my current salary?
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.560]   Right.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.540]   And that's missing a lot of, it's missing a lot of options
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.800]   when you just think, okay, how do I replace
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.560]   my Amazon salary?
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.020]   That's the wrong way to do it, right?
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.780]   Because your freedom number is not just reflecting,
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.000]   I'm in my exact same circumstance.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.820]   Your freedom number is also reflecting,
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.040]   you can really re-engineer a lot about your life,
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.260]   including how much your life actually cost.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.040]   - And that, I think what's crazy,
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.680]   and let me just give my own example,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.240]   is that my freedom number is $3,000.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.800]   So I had a day job, started AppSumo,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.020]   got obsessed with the problem, not necessarily the solution,
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.360]   which is I think most smart people get backwards.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.480]   My freedom number is 3,000.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.280]   After about, I think it was three months,
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.580]   I hit my freedom number, quit my job.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.800]   So I'm making $3,000 a month,
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.940]   living my dream life already, which was amazing.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.180]   Now here's where it's interesting, fast forward 14 years,
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.920]   I'm now, I don't know what this is monthly,
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.620]   but I made around $3 million last year.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.940]   And that's not to brag, it's just to show you that,
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.900]   yeah, just because I got to my $3,000
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.980]   and I could do what I really wanted,
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.700]   and then there's ways, like how do I not quit?
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.020]   How do I stick with things?
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.020]   14 years later, it's now, I don't know,
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.680]   100, $200,000 a month number.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.380]   And doing the thing you want, one,
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.180]   even if you're not making crazy amounts of money,
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.940]   at least you're making as much as you need,
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.040]   and you're living the life you wanna live.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.660]   - Yeah, well, and once you're able to go full-time
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.340]   to what you're doing, now you're amplifying.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.260]   You're accelerating, right?
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.720]   So it's not surprising if you got to the $3,000
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.020]   while working at Intel,
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.800]   or whatever the day job was at the time,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.180]   what happens when you now get to give
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.180]   all of your energy to it?
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.940]   Like, well, obviously it's gonna grow faster.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.020]   So you have some sort of acceleration,
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.260]   which I love about it.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.900]   I also just wanna put a pin in something
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.560]   you just said there as well, problem not solution.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.360]   I mean, assuming what you're getting out there
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.340]   is, again, the experimentalist mindset.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.500]   The good problem is great,
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.660]   because you know if you solve it,
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.920]   you're gonna have an audience.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.460]   Finding solutions is hard.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.420]   So if you just fix on a solution,
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.020]   maybe that's a good solution.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.860]   Like, you don't know.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.460]   Like, you have to put it on the market and see,
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.920]   and you don't wanna just be chasing a terrible idea.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.240]   I mean, if your original solution for AppSumo was,
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.080]   for the problem was,
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.300]   yeah, we're gonna fax people these recommendations.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.420]   And if you really stuck to that,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.340]   like, well, we gotta make the faxing work.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.660]   We just need better advertising.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.180]   Like, you know, you're gonna be in trouble.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.020]   But if you have the,
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.180]   no, we're trying to solve this problem.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.060]   The technology might change.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.900]   - Yeah.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.720]   - That wasn't a side,
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.860]   but I think that's a really smart aside.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.620]   A great problem is easier to find than the correct solution.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.080]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.720]   So at AppSumo, I was obsessed with the problem
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.400]   of how do I get software creators, customers?
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.340]   That's what I just wanted to solve.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.960]   And my first two experiments did not work.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.300]   One of them was called Software Taco,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.540]   which was software reviews.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.540]   No one came.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.380]   - Yep.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.060]   - And then I built another thing called Reward Level,
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.940]   which I can't even explain what we did.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.720]   And then I did AppSumo where I was like,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.400]   all right, it's like a group on for software.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.940]   And I launched it in a weekend on Reddit
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.980]   and instantly people bought this deal.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.500]   I was like, oh, well, that's cool.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.340]   - Yeah.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.180]   - The other parts I got a comment on problem versus solution
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.900]   is that a lot of smart people are solution oriented,
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.200]   which is great,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.580]   but your customers don't care about your solutions.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.680]   They care about their problems.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.980]   And so the most obvious example
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.880]   that most people are getting backwards today is AI.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.220]   Everyone's like, AI,
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.560]   it's gonna replace Cal Newport.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.660]   Noah Kagan's gone.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.500]   All of us are gone.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.740]   But people still wake up.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.020]   You woke up today, Cal, and you have your family.
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.180]   You have the show.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.220]   You have your book.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.980]   Those are problems that are going on in your life.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.120]   And everything that's inconveniencing you,
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.060]   everything that takes your time,
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.900]   everything that annoys you
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.860]   are all actually business opportunities
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.340]   that you can actually create businesses around.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.620]   And one of the ways I know your audience
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.580]   and what you focus on is how do you engineer great lives?
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.700]   How do you work backwards from this?
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.900]   And one of the easiest ways is think about your problems
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.380]   and experiment around it.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.100]   When I was experimenting on how to create my dream life,
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.940]   I don't know, everyone,
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.420]   I guess when you get rich, they buy Ferraris.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.900]   And so I like rented one on Turo and it sucked.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   I was like, I'm so stressed out.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.540]   So I was like, I'm pretty good with my Tesla and Miata.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.740]   And so, and again, just the same thing.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.820]   You think about the problem you have,
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.500]   like, hey, I wanna figure out where I wanna live.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.840]   All right, go experiment living different places
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.080]   and see if there's places that actually solve
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.920]   that problem for you.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.100]   And with AI, coming back to that example,
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.120]   people are like, how do I fit AI into different stuff?
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.020]   It's like, no one cares about it,
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.000]   but they do care about how do you help them
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.680]   do their travel plans?
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.280]   Then maybe AI can support it.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.740]   And I just, especially with AppSumo,
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.160]   I'm seeing literally hundreds of thousands of people
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   build things and then try to go find people
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.880]   to convince to use it versus the other way around,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.600]   which is who else has problems?
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.440]   What's your problem?
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.640]   Let me try to solve it and then see if this AI
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.180]   or technology can then support it.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.800]   Yep, yeah, you get the feedback.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.820]   Okay, well, let me try this.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.920]   Well, let me try this.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.960]   I mean, when it comes to courage,
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.280]   sticking with this a little bit too,
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.040]   what I've seen with courage is people get,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.800]   not addicted to, but what they're really seeking
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.080]   is the drug hit of the immediate aftermath
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.300]   of doing something big.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.800]   And that becomes a substitute
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.440]   for actually executing successfully something big.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.400]   What they get excited about is not this new life
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.560]   I could probably create if I had a business
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.840]   that could support me.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.320]   They get excited about if I quit everything,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.540]   this could be so dramatic,
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.440]   that's gonna feel really exciting and I want that hit.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   The problem is that hit wears off in about a day
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.240]   and you still have to create a business.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.760]   I wrote about this in 2012 in So Good They Can't Ignore You
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.100]   where I was saying, oh, you have to be very careful
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.260]   about courage culture, I called it,
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:49.260]   that lionizes the feeling of making a courageous decision.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.980]   That that's a trap.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.560]   That yeah, that feels good and then it wears off.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.020]   So like what you need to focus on is execution.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.940]   Entrepreneurship is rife with that, right?
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.500]   The people that they really just want the hit
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.780]   of I'm doing my own thing
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.780]   and just calling themselves entrepreneur, which is fine,
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.860]   but it blinds them to it.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.140]   How do I actually, what do I do day two?
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.380]   What do I do day three?
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.100]   How do I actually execute?
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.020]   So I'm assuming you see a lot of that as well.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.200]   Courage feels good for like 24 hours.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.700]   And what I believe is that everyone can be an entrepreneur
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.700]   and everyone is courageous.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.120]   And what I found through myself,
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.860]   putting this book together in the past four years
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.260]   is how afraid I was of putting the book together.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.620]   And then realizing that what's the hard thing we're avoiding
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.180]   for everyone out there.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.700]   And most of us know that reality.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.800]   We know that answer.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.960]   Like, hey, I don't like my job.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.800]   I don't like my partner.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.300]   I don't like where I live.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.840]   I don't like that I'm not consistent.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.100]   I like that I'm too consistent.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.060]   And then being mindful, aware that, okay,
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.040]   if I can face this problem,
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.440]   what's on the other side of that?
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.140]   And that was this book experience for me.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.900]   And that's what this book to me is for other people.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.320]   It's like, what is the life that you want to be engineering
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.940]   and what are you afraid of that we can face?
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.460]   And I think you brought up a great point.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.180]   I don't think it has to be some,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.940]   I got to quit my job today thing.
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.560]   I think today you could literally right now, not how,
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.180]   post on social media, hey,
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.300]   I'm looking for one person to talk about gardening.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.420]   You could text your WhatsApp friends or Discord
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.820]   or Slack or whatever.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.080]   Hey, I was thinking about starting a newsletter
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.760]   about AI for 10 bucks a month.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.820]   Does anyone want to join that?
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.120]   And that's courageous, you know, in the book,
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.340]   there's so many books about entrepreneurship.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.780]   There's only a place called Harvard.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.660]   I don't know if you've heard of it
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.460]   that teaches entrepreneurship.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.300]   - I know.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.060]   - But then how come everyone's not being entrepreneurs?
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.900]   - Yeah.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.420]   - And it's because they're scared, right?
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.460]   And they're led to believe it's this thing
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.380]   that there's a big gap that they can't do it.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.980]   And you have to listen to more things or be prepared.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.820]   But the reality is that everyone can start today.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.700]   And then the other part of it
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.980]   that we've talked about in courageous
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.640]   is that you have to practice the fear of asking.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.480]   - Yeah.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.740]   - And both these things of starting and asking
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.740]   are really what hold most people back.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.980]   And when they do it, they realize like, holy crap,
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.880]   confidence is built through courage.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.500]   And it doesn't have to be a big thing,
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.900]   but it can be small things that compound
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.720]   over significant periods of time.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.560]   - Yeah.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.260]   Well, this is real courage versus fake courage maybe, right?
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.060]   The real courage is the thing
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.120]   that people really need courage for
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.260]   is I'm gonna do something
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.020]   where I could get negative feedback right away.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:21.920]   I could fail right away.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.760]   It could be clear.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.580]   I'm gonna ask someone,
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.420]   would you like to subscribe to my newsletter?
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.380]   Like that's where you need real courage.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.620]   It's almost like fake courage
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.740]   where it's I'm gonna make a big grandiose gesture,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.760]   but I can just do that.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.220]   Like I'm not gonna say I'm quitting my job
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.160]   to start a company.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.460]   And then the universe says, you know, you're not allowed.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.500]   Like, oh, I failed at it.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.020]   There's no real courage in it
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.940]   in the sense that you're not getting,
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.060]   it's not something you can fail at in the moment.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.900]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.700]   We have the fake courage
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.100]   of let me make a big declaration on social media
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.820]   about how I'm quitting my job.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.580]   But the real courage is, let me put this out here.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.340]   Will you actually buy this?
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.240]   I get this a lot.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.500]   I don't know if you've seen this
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.660]   when you were thinking about writing a book.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.980]   A lot of nonfiction writers come to me like this
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.620]   where they wanna do the big gesture.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.780]   I'm gonna write a book.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.260]   But as soon as you give them the real steps you have to do,
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.700]   which all involve you having to put yourself
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.500]   or your idea out there and try to get someone
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.800]   to sign off on it, they do anything they can to avoid that.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.100]   It's like, no, I don't wanna try to talk to an agent.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.380]   The agent could say no.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.620]   I don't wanna like pitch this book to a publisher.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.460]   They could say no.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.420]   So what I've done is I've invested a lot of money
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.380]   into this PR firm and I'm gonna build up a following
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.580]   for my self-published book
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.420]   and it's gonna become so successful
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.980]   that the publishers are gonna beg me to sell.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.420]   There's a real conversation I had.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.340]   I was like, you've just engineered
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.820]   every point of acute failure out of your plan.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.260]   That's what you're doing there.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.300]   You've invented a path to publishing a book
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.040]   that does not really exist so that you never have
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.800]   to have real courage of an agent saying,
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.500]   you know what, this idea is not there.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.700]   Let's take a quick break to talk about one of the sponsors
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.780]   that makes this show possible.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.880]   Talking about our friends at Express VPN.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.180]   Here's why you need to use a VPN.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.600]   When you use the internet,
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:10.180]   people can see what sites and services you're talking to.
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.960]   Your internet service provider at home
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.040]   knows what sites and services you're talking to.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.780]   The hotel you're staying at can tell
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.400]   what sites and services you're talking to.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.100]   That weird guy next to you in the coffee shop
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.140]   with the antenna on his head
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.660]   can be sniffing your packets off the radio waves
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.820]   and seeing what sites and services you're talking to.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.460]   A VPN protects you from that violation of privacy.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.700]   Here's how it works.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.560]   Instead of directly talking to the site
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.100]   or service you're interested in,
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.200]   you take your message for that site or service,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.380]   you encrypt it, and then you send it to a VPN server
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.580]   that then unencrypts it
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.880]   and talks to that site or service on your behalf.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.980]   So now your home internet service provider,
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.460]   your hotel, or the weird guy with the antenna,
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.820]   all they know is you're talking to a VPN server,
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.800]   you gain full privacy on your actual internet behavior.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.780]   If you're gonna use a VPN, I recommend Express VPN.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.800]   There's a reason why they're ranked number one
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.060]   by CNET and TechRadar
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.540]   because their software is very easy to use.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.720]   You turn it on with a click of a button,
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.060]   use your sites and apps normally,
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.620]   and you have the full VPN protection.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.340]   It works on phones, laptops, even routers,
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.740]   so that everyone using your Wi-Fi will be protected.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.480]   They have servers around the world,
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.160]   so there's always gonna be one nearby for fast performance,
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.300]   and they have plenty of bandwidth.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.780]   So protect your online privacy
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.300]   by visiting expressvpn.com/deep today.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.220]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S vpn.com/deep,
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.320]   and you can get an extra three months free.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.180]   That's expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.860]   I also wanna talk about a new sponsor of the show
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.460]   that I'm very excited about,
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.940]   and that is our friends at Maui Nui Venison.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.420]   Maui Nui Venison is a mission-based food company
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.820]   bringing the healthiest red meat on the planet
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.220]   directly to your door.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.540]   I absolutely love this meat and the mission of Maui Nui.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.140]   Now, here's the idea.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.460]   On the island of Maui,
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.220]   they have too many of this type of deer
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.520]   called the axis deer.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.940]   It's an invasive species.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.380]   It's not native to the island.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.420]   They're eating all the vegetation,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.300]   and it's causing real ecological harm,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.420]   so they have to cull these herds.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.620]   Well, Maui Nui figured out how can we harvest
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.260]   the incredibly nutrient-dense meat from these deer herds
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.820]   that we have to cull anyways
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.440]   and sell them directly to consumers.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.700]   The result is the most sustainable red meat
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.000]   you can find in the world,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.220]   and it's incredibly nutrient-dense
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.860]   because these are animals that basically eat
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.420]   a Hawaiian salad bar all day long.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.560]   It's incredibly high in nutrients, low in fat,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.660]   tastes fantastic.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.700]   The jerky is great.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.740]   We've already eaten two full boxes of this.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.540]   The steaks are great.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.220]   We just had those recently.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.920]   Even my kids liked it, which is fantastic.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.340]   So it's a great company with a great mission.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.300]   So if you go to MauinuiVenison.com/deepquestions

[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.260]   All right, let's get back to it.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.180]   Oh, you're not the right person to ride, yeah, keep trying.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.920]   Yeah, people go a long way to get away
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.140]   from that type of real courage.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.860]   So maybe we've coined a new term here.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.260]   Yeah, real courage requires I might fail right away.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.100]   - Yeah, and everyone can do it.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.480]   I truly believe that.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.260]   And it's really just facing yourself.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.940]   And if you think about driving,
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.980]   like when you went to your office today,
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.020]   or you're driving somewhere,
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.500]   you have a destination and you plan a route.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.200]   And most people, it's very fun to plan the route,
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.320]   but when you start driving, the route might change,
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.220]   but that only happens when you start driving.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.820]   And same with swimming, same with cooking,
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.940]   same with everything in life,
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.200]   is that you can't learn it not being in the kitchen.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.800]   You're not gonna swim sitting outside the pool.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.040]   And when people post something today,
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.820]   or ask one person today,
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.560]   and realize they can get started today, huh?
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.620]   Like when you were talking about this fake courage,
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.100]   it made me think through therapy,
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.740]   and I found I have a lot of anxiety when I'm home alone.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.160]   And my therapist would always kind of say,
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.860]   "The only way in is through."
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.340]   And I was just like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.420]   Like, "I don't appreciate your in is through.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.660]   I'm trying to go through, man."
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.520]   So I would do this grandiose things where I'm like,
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.720]   "I'm gonna go in the woods alone for a week."
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.100]   And that's what I would do.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.140]   And I would just be alone, I turn my phone,
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.760]   and I come home and I'm like, "Okay, I did it.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.380]   I'm not afraid of being alone."
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.780]   And he was like, "Dude, life still goes on.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.340]   What about today?"
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.540]   And my reality, I don't really share this,
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.820]   but it's like, yeah, now when I'm home on a Saturday,
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.460]   there's a moment where it hits and I'm afraid,
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.820]   and I'm anxious, what am I doing today?
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.260]   And it's like, "Oh, cool.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.100]   This is a chance for me to learn who I can become."
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.340]   Yes, it's still hard, but it's something that we're now
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.560]   with positive self-talk and experiencing it,
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.700]   that is going through it on an ongoing basis.
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.800]   And it's available worldwide for free
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.380]   for everyone to face these things and do things.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.700]   Again, today, I think that's the myth entrepreneurship.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.980]   Like, "Ah, I don't know, I need to wait for my domain.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.700]   I need to wait for this patent thing."
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.340]   No, you need to talk to one person,
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.820]   put yourself out there just a little bit,
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.660]   and see what happens.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.620]   I think you'll be shocked.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.260]   All right, so let's get back now to the nitty-gritty.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.740]   So I caught my attention here, I think it's a cool idea.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.360]   You recommend getting your first one to three customers
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.420]   way earlier in the process than people think.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.480]   People think, "Customers come after I've perfected
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.660]   everything and have my idea figured out."
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.420]   You say you should be getting one to three customers
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.740]   in the first 48 hours, you get your freedom number,
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.380]   and almost the next thing you should do
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.700]   is be trying to get customers.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.460]   Walk us through this inversion here.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.460]   - Yeah, the inversion here is that most people
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.760]   are founder first, so they're like, "I got this problem,"
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.620]   which is good, you should always be your first customer
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.860]   and make things that you're excited to make.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.540]   But then they're like, "I'm gonna go build it,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.860]   and then I'm gonna try to find problems
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.100]   to then eat my solution."
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.940]   And they're like, "Damn, this is hard."
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.600]   But the reality, which is actually a lot easier of a path,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.140]   if people wanna make it easier on themselves,
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.820]   is just really thinking customer first.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.380]   So what's the expertise you have
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.420]   or areas you're interested in,
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.980]   and who are in your zones of influence?
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.760]   So someone emailed me yesterday, and he said,
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.000]   "I wanna do stuff in real estate, I know two people,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.300]   I wanna do stuff in kidneys, I know one person,
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.480]   but I think I'm gonna try to do something online
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.980]   in this area, I know no one."
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.260]   - Yeah.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.940]   - I was like, "Okay, why don't you try both?"
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.940]   Again, it doesn't have to be binary, and see what happens.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.440]   And what I'm encouraging people to do is work backwards
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.740]   from how to make it easier on yourself.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:53.180]   Like, I've been in tech this world since I was a little kid,
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.020]   and so it's easier for me to understand it
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.300]   and succeed in it, doesn't mean you can't.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.200]   Well, why would people wanna make it harder on themselves?
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   - Yeah, okay, so excellent.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.980]   So then you have a customer too, or you've learned
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.940]   in failing to get a customer for this idea,
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.920]   like, okay, there's like something not going on,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.900]   like this general area I'm exploring,
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.100]   I'm not getting friction.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.620]   Over here though, like someone's interested in it.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.140]   So you get to a point where you have a few people
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.560]   buying your greeting cards, right?
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.140]   Now what's the growth?
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.460]   Now we're thinking about the growth.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.500]   And you talk about zero to one is probably the hardest.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.220]   One to 100, 100 to 1,000, 1,000 to a million,
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.180]   like these steps are no harder than zero to one.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.660]   But how do you now that we're at one,
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.820]   what's the right way to think about those next growth steps?
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.840]   - Yeah, most people don't become millionaires
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.540]   'cause they never make a dollar, is what I've noticed.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.380]   As I asked you, I'm like,
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.500]   "Oh, how much money have you made in your business?"
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.340]   Zero.
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.160]   "How long have you been doing it?"
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.060]   12 months.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.800]   Okay, maybe there's another way to approach it.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.140]   And so again, coming back to the customer first approach,
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.380]   how do we get three customers this weekend?
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.220]   And guess what?
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.940]   If you didn't get any, awesome.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.780]   You didn't waste money.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.940]   You didn't buy Shopify.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.380]   You didn't get a domain.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.340]   You didn't hire people and spend all this money.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.020]   And then all these people that weren't interested
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.020]   in what you are doing, you can ask them why not.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.900]   Hey, how come you weren't interested?
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.800]   Because I don't care about lawn care.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.340]   Because I don't wanna buy a greeting card
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.860]   because I don't need consulting on this thing.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.140]   Okay, well, tell me more what you're doing.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.780]   And if you start listening to people,
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.180]   listen to yourself and listen to others,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.300]   they'll just tell you their problems.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.940]   And those are all business opportunities.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.140]   And so the scale is generally not the harder part.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.140]   It's getting going and then practicing
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.660]   the skills of starting and asking, right?
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.020]   Because that's what all business is.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.840]   It's just like this show.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.620]   It's like, you're asking me questions and I'm answering.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.480]   And if you wanna ask for a raise,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.660]   if you wanna ask for a husband or wife,
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.820]   and you have to do the same thing in business,
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.180]   you have to ask for customers.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.580]   And that is something that everyone can practice.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.420]   And then you've heard me talk about the coffee challenge.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.500]   It's in "Million Dollar Weekend."
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.460]   And it's practicing asking at a coffee shop for a discount.
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.100]   And then ideally you get rejected.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.300]   You ask for 10% off, you get rejected.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.400]   And you're like, oh, that's not so scary.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.980]   What's next?
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.580]   And then when you get to a customer,
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.940]   you can ask them to buy your service.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.940]   You're rejected or not.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.700]   And then you find out, wow, have you been practicing it?
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.260]   This is a lot easier.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.340]   Now, the two things I would say,
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.700]   once you've gotten your three customers
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.160]   is delivering for those three people.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.380]   The best businesses are the ones that work.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.940]   And people in life stop doing the things
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.380]   that got them successful.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.180]   I don't know if you've noticed that.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.180]   A lot of times in life, it's like,
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.300]   hey, how'd you get to this point?
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.060]   Well, I did therapy, I worked out.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.220]   Maybe I have this morning routine.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.960]   Maybe I've read all Cal Newport's books.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.780]   I'm good with my technology.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.600]   Well, how's it going today?
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.140]   Yeah, I'm not really doing that much.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.220]   Okay, just go back and do more of what works.
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.520]   And so the two kind of frameworks
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.240]   that have helped AppSumo and myself,
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.160]   and I think now tens of thousands of other people.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.120]   One is this law of 100 concept.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.740]   And literally, we have a website,
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.140]   we're gonna have a free app around this.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.120]   But it's like, do the thing 100 times and then quit.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.260]   - Interesting, interesting.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.100]   Not before.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.500]   - No, so once you've had success,
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.340]   so let's say, and what I mean by success is customers.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.940]   People are like, yeah, this woman, what was her name?
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.780]   Stephanie, email me.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.420]   She's like, yeah, I got my first customer five bucks.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.700]   I'm like, hell yeah, you did.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.920]   I'm like, you don't think AppSumo first sale, $12?
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.760]   - Yeah.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.260]   - Yesterday sales, $333,000 in a day.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.760]   But I started with 12 bucks.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.100]   That's how every business starts.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.600]   That's how everything starts, just one.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.760]   And so the concepts I would say is do this law of 100,
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.280]   which is like do 100 posts on social media if that's it.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.500]   Do 100 calls, do 100 clients, do 100 days,
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.640]   and then have a checklist just each day.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.040]   And then at the end of it, then you quit.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.920]   And what happens is people, by the end of the hundreds,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.380]   they're like, actually, this is working.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.640]   I'm like, I know.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.560]   Just keep doing it.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.440]   And then the other part that people need to really think
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.240]   about in business and frankly in life for engineering is
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.460]   how do you just keep doubling down what's working?
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.920]   - Yes.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.680]   - And that's one of these annoying maxims and cliches
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.600]   that we all hear but we don't actually embrace.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.400]   Let me tell you an example literally from 7 a.m. today.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.600]   We built this thing called a business idea generator
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.440]   at AppSumo.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.640]   We spent like two months,
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   and I don't know, with soft developers and stuff,
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.680]   it was probably like 30,000, maybe 20 to 40, to build it.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.520]   We've never launched it, never finished it.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.720]   And someone on the team's like, oh, we should launch it.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.980]   And another person's like, yeah, it'll only take 10 hours.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.440]   I was like, okay, well, what's already working
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.280]   in the business?
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.040]   It's like, oh, we have this product, tidycal.com.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.860]   It's a Calendly alternative.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.560]   It's growing like a weed.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.680]   - I like tidycal, by the way.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.520]   It's a great product.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.120]   - Oh, yeah, like AppSumo.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.280]   We hate subscriptions.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.200]   - Yep. - Down with subscriptions
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.040]   on software.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.480]   We built this anti-subscription calendar tool
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.500]   called TidyCal.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.240]   I'm like, all right, well, 10 hours in TidyCal,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.960]   I know is working.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.580]   Why don't we just keep doing that?
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.040]   And I just, I used to try all these things.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.000]   We're like, okay, this is working,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.660]   but I'm gonna go off and play on these other areas.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.240]   And I've seen, like, if you just kept doing more
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.080]   of what works, and that's why we always use that phrase,
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.640]   just double down, keep doing more of what works,
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.460]   you keep getting the success that you got.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.280]   So in business, really, in life, just look backwards.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.040]   How'd you get your first three customers?
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.400]   Ah, I just DM'd people on Twitter.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.060]   How many of you DM'd today?
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.660]   None, okay, do that.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.600]   How'd you get first three customers?
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.500]   Referrals.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.340]   Have you done that?
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.160]   No, do more of that.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.740]   And people get really obsessed,
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.800]   and I will tell you, we have a two-person
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.120]   business intelligence team.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   We spend a million dollars a year just on data.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.860]   At AppSumo, just on data.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.680]   Like, we do very complicated stuff.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.780]   And people kind of laugh sometimes when I'm telling them,
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.720]   like, yeah, you just DM, 'cause that's what worked.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.280]   Like, no, no, no, tell me the secret stuff.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.680]   I'm like, you don't need the secret stuff.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.480]   Yeah, that doesn't help for you right now.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.960]   - Yeah, I love the double-down idea, by the way,
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.840]   when I came across that, because it seems like
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.160]   everyone I know who's doing something entrepreneurial,
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.480]   very successful, this is a real common thread.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.800]   This is working.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.440]   Like, we found a fitness peak in the fitness landscape
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.080]   that we're moving up the slope.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.840]   Let's just pick up our pace.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.400]   Like, we know this is actually working,
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.840]   acquiring customers this way,
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.560]   offering them this type of thing.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.760]   Why don't we keep pushing that
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.080]   till that thing is no longer going?
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.720]   - You know, I think a weird, and tell me if this is wrong,
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.840]   but to me, like, an interesting, isolated,
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.020]   purified example of that is, like, in the YouTube world,
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.880]   this is what, like, MrBeast did.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.860]   He sort of figured out, like, what's working on videos
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.120]   that the algorithm is recommending on YouTube?
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.480]   And they just kept doubling down.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.640]   Like, let's clarify that.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.680]   Let's make that even bigger.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.520]   Let's spend more money.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.920]   Let's get rid of more of the stuff that's not working.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.940]   We don't need to invent a new format.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.560]   We don't need to do what we think is gonna work.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.400]   This is working.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.240]   Let's double the amount of money.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.280]   Let's double the stakes.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.480]   Let's, you know, it was just this continual doubling down,
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.020]   and they end up in this interesting place
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.480]   where you might spend $20 million on a video
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.520]   and get 200 million views on the video,
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.440]   just everything scaled up,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.020]   but it's probably the same template he had
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.400]   when it was 100,000 views
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.520]   and they were spending $10,000 on a video.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.240]   They just kept pushing, right?
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.220]   This, let's keep going.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.620]   I see that all the time.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.420]   It's weird, though, because people don't wanna do that.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.560]   I don't know why you would think that would be our instinct,
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.720]   but people like the platform you're working on,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:14.620]   they have this idea of there's gonna be some other idea
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.600]   that's gonna really take things up.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.520]   I mean, look, this is Steve Jobs returning to Apple in '97.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.360]   What's working?
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.520]   Like, people like these Macs, so get rid of all the junk.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.260]   Let's make it much clearer what we sell.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   We have two groups.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.400]   Let's just be as clear as possible.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.080]   This is what we are doing for you
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.400]   and just push those things.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.840]   You know, it's just clarity.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.200]   But I'm also self-assessing here, though, Noah,
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.420]   because I should be doing this in parts of my life,
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.080]   and I know, I know I'm not.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.840]   I know I should be doing this with my podcast
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.260]   or there's elements I know that really worked
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.800]   I really should be doubling down on, but it's hard.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.640]   I don't know why that psychology is so hard,
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.600]   but hey, this is working.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.760]   This did better than this.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.200]   Do more of this.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.020]   It's interesting why that's so hard.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.500]   - Yeah, there's a, I don't know which woman said it,
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.160]   but there's a famous quote that I like,
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.920]   which is like, if you want variety in dating,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.040]   date one person.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.860]   And you know, you're married,
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.180]   and I'm in a committed relationship, about to have a child,
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.220]   and the idea that people need to consider is like,
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.600]   how do I find the thing I'm enjoying
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.140]   and that I can just keep going deeper and deeper
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.340]   and deeper and on, because success is boring.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.000]   'Cause it's working.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.060]   And I remember I went to my business partner, Chad,
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.120]   who's a CTO, he's one of my best friends.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.760]   I'm like, Chad, you like doing all the boring stuff.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.020]   And I like starting new stuff.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.280]   I'm the new guy.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.780]   And he's like, shut up, dude.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.660]   I like new stuff too, everyone does.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.540]   And you know, in my forties,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:45.140]   I would say what's exciting to me is things that work
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.400]   and just making them work better.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.820]   And I joke about this.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.180]   I bought this house from an NFL kicker, the one I live in.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.620]   And I just joke, I texted this guy.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.820]   I was like, dude, what's your work week like?
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.940]   (both laughing)
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.140]   Think about his days, eight to five.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.280]   He's like, what'd you do to kick the ball?
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.140]   And then his job is like 10 seconds on a Sunday
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.500]   for a few months.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.380]   And it's something we've all stuck with things
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.300]   for long periods of time.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.280]   I think people don't give themselves enough credit.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.820]   Like you've probably stuck with brushing your teeth,
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.220]   ideally twice a day.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.780]   Or you've stuck with certain habits
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.100]   and you maybe haven't given yourself enough credit for it.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.260]   And then thinking about, okay,
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.980]   what are these elements in my personal life
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.260]   as well in professional life,
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.540]   ideally in entrepreneurship or in your job?
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.860]   And how can I replicate that?
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.580]   And in terms of engineering your life,
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.620]   like you can replicate the ones that generally
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.060]   haven't been as much work for you.
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.820]   Right, so with YouTube content,
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:44.220]   we found this video where I knock on doors works.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.300]   I just go knock on people's doors.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.640]   Every one of our videos was me knocking on doors.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.700]   Now the reality there is over time,
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.440]   it's just, it's very stressful for me.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.240]   It's very anxiety and it's not sustainable.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.440]   And in terms of success,
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.580]   what I find very sexy is longevity.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.440]   And so you have to find the Venn diagram in success,
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.220]   which is what do you like and what does the world want?
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.580]   And so now with content, and I'd even say with AppSumo
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.720]   is how do I do these things for 10 years?
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.700]   How do I do it for 10 years?
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.060]   So if I'm doing content like knock on doors,
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.640]   I cannot do that for 10 years.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.480]   - Yep.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.500]   - And there's a lot more, I want more glorification.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.800]   I want more sexification on sustainability
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.960]   'cause there's a lot of glory.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.340]   And like you made, you got rich this year off crypto
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.620]   or you got rich off some,
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.040]   like this YouTube is big all of a sudden.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.300]   It's like be big over 20 years.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.140]   - Yeah.
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.180]   - And you know, I've worked for billionaires
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.400]   and I've interviewed a lot of them on my channel
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.720]   and they find things they're excited to work on
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.140]   and they get rich after 20 years.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.960]   And those are really interesting nuances.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.100]   It's like, ah, find something that works.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.200]   Find something I enjoy that works for me and my lifestyle.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.780]   I think that's missed out upon,
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.520]   especially on Silicon Valley
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.100]   and then stick with that for a long period of time
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.440]   and live a great life.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.280]   And finally be happy that there's enough with it.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.240]   Really, I can do it that way?
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.760]   Yeah, you can.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.600]   - Yep.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.200]   Well, you know who I think personifies that often?
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.640]   Is novelist.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.920]   It's something I've studied
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.360]   and it's actually, there's two categories of novelist
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.520]   and I call them the Michael Crichton's and the John Grisham's
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   because they capture the two different mindsets.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.340]   Crichton was all about I want to do everything, right?
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.380]   Oh, my novel's doing well, I want to direct,
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.740]   I want to screen write,
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.720]   I want to start my own production company,
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.540]   I want to do television.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.580]   He saw I have my foot in the door,
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.380]   now I want to do everything.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.520]   Grisham on the other hand said, great, The Firm did well,
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.380]   his second book, The Firm did well, great.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:41.900]   I can quit my job, I can move to some property
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.980]   and I can just write for six months a year
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.580]   and then the other six months a year,
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.620]   I'm going to be the commissioner of my kids' little league.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.980]   He bought a bunch of fields
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.680]   and built a really nice little league complex
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.900]   and loves baseballs, I want to coach baseball.
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.680]   And a lot of novelists follow the Grisham approach,
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.640]   which is this is great.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.060]   I hope no one notices but I'm making a living
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.200]   just writing a book every year and it's all I have to do
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.340]   and I have to do publicity for like three weeks
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.760]   because fiction writer publicity, what can you do, right?
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.040]   I mean, there's only so much you can do
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.600]   and you have a name and they're just happy with it
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.180]   and they live in cool places.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:15.860]   They tend to live in cool places
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.280]   and have really cool offices.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.120]   So I think there's a whole cadre of fiction writers
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.320]   that are great at this.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.420]   I can do this well,
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.220]   I want to do this for the rest of my life.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.860]   I hope no one takes away my ability to just write
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.740]   and I don't do anything else
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.120]   but you don't see these fiction writers
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.060]   with seven business ideas
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.120]   and they own a bunch of car dealerships
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.420]   and they're just like, I write books, it's great.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:39.260]   Isn't this crazy?
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.620]   Like people are paying me to do this.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.940]   So we can all learn from John Grisham, I guess,
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.900]   even though our temptations to be Michael Crichton.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.340]   - Well, I think your comment here is what I've observed
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.260]   from tens of thousands of people
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.380]   and talking with them in Million Dollar Weekend
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.900]   and meeting them.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.940]   Most people don't believe
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.300]   they can actually live these dream lives
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.400]   and the dream life, it doesn't have to be
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.240]   what people imagine.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.740]   That's where even the freedom number comes in.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.780]   It could be literally, so my buddy Tynan's here,
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.500]   his dream life is getting up at 10,
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.580]   drinking tea from 10 to 12.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.220]   - Playing pinball for the next three hours, is that what?
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.420]   - Well, no, no, so pinball's at night.
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.900]   So he does a pinball tournament with his wife,
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.700]   but from like 12 to five, he'll do like house projects.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.340]   And then he has a cruise site, cruisesheet.com.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.100]   And then from like seven to 10,
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.380]   he'll do a pinball tournament with his wife,
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.640]   hot tub, steam room, which he built his own steam room
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.380]   and built his own secret pinball room.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.860]   And that's his dream life.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:31.700]   And guess what?
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.520]   He's living it.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.160]   And it's not as expensive as people think, but that's his.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.540]   And I don't think people realize
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.500]   that their dream life is possible
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.720]   and it's actually not as far away as they imagine.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.560]   Like my dream life is not, I get anxiety, I like working.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.520]   I like it, I love it.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.240]   I was up at 6 a.m. working today.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.480]   I'm so excited about this book.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.900]   I'm so excited promoting software deals.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.520]   I like making content.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.660]   Tynan doesn't, and he's okay with that too.
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.760]   He's okay, he puts out a blog post every month.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.860]   That's great.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.320]   And I think when people think about
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.140]   how do they wanna end the year,
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.240]   that's a really like fixed good timeframe, I think,
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.760]   for people to have clarity on.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.400]   You can write out how that dream life looks like.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.140]   And then, huh, maybe like when you talk
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:10.980]   about lifestyle engineering,
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.880]   you can work backwards from that.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.400]   Maybe, what can I start today
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.280]   that actually gets me a little closer to that?
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.120]   - Yeah.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.140]   - And for me, it took me, I don't know, man,
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.280]   15 years to finally get it.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.040]   It takes time, and so be patient and kind along the way.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.040]   And one kind of hack that I've done the past five years,
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.400]   give or take five years,
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.640]   is just review my week at the end of each week.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.960]   - Yeah.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.880]   - And you start doing these things,
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.700]   you're like, oh, this week sucked because of this meeting.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.040]   This week sucked because of this,
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.880]   or here's what sucked because of me.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.300]   And then you say, well, how can I make next week better?
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.940]   And you start doing that week after week
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.740]   after week after week.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.700]   And like I have it every week.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.080]   I have my review later today.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.780]   I just have this automatic review on Slack notification.
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.980]   - Well, this is part of what I liked about your book
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.260]   and why I wanted you on the show,
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.020]   is you're almost unique, I think,
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.700]   among people, especially Silicon Valley people,
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.880]   talking about entrepreneurship and how congruent you are
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.020]   with the way we talk about this on the show,
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.860]   which is we always are emphasizing.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.820]   You need to picture your ideal lifestyle holistically.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.660]   It's everything about your life.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.760]   What does your day look like?
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.020]   Are you walking outside into the woods
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.420]   or are you walking down like a cool city street
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.920]   to like an interesting coffee shop?
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.660]   Are you like a master of the universe,
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.240]   making moves and things,
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.140]   or at least that kind of appeal to you?
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.520]   Or is it the like, I'm having tea
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.820]   and there's gonna be like the hot...
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.020]   Don't get specific about like, this is the specific city
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:38.920]   where I live, specific job,
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.160]   but like what are the attributes of your day?
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.980]   Do you imagine like sitting outside?
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.900]   I'm on my back patio and we have cafe lights
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.580]   and like my family and friends are over
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.460]   and we're just kind of like shooting the breeze
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.360]   just out like having something,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.020]   just like a real social aspect.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.520]   What resonates?
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.820]   Non-specific in terms of I live exactly here,
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.980]   I do exactly this, and then figure out how I get there.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.600]   And for a lot of people, this leads them to places
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   that they didn't think about before
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.680]   because what we tend to do
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.500]   without that holistic type of assessment,
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.660]   which your book really pushes,
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.640]   and I wanna touch here in a second on your last chapter,
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.260]   which like gets systematic,
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.060]   let's get into color-coded calendars here.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.600]   When people don't do that,
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.840]   they overprice the feeling of pride
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.160]   that comes with elite professional accomplishment.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.640]   And they say this is the thing that's gonna matter most.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.720]   Like so in Silicon Valley,
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.360]   I'm assuming there's a real pressure for,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.660]   yeah, but imagine that feeling
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.700]   when you're king of the roost,
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.740]   you just had the billion dollar IPO.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.060]   And like that's gonna feel really good.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.260]   And I'm sure it does kind of feel good
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.500]   and you have some pride with that.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.180]   But how valuable is that compared to everything else?
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.300]   How long does, I mean,
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.780]   versus all of these other things
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.860]   are important to your life,
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.140]   don't overprice that
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:49.100]   as if that's gonna be the most important thing.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.280]   Or if you're a writer,
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.860]   if my book is like number one
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:52.900]   in the New York Times bestseller,
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.560]   like that'll feel good,
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.040]   but also then like you're doing the dishes, right?
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.960]   And the day-to-day of your reality matters.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.180]   So I love how you have this holistic approach as well.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:07.000]   You're building a life.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.080]   Your work is part of it because you need money
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.880]   and also you're gonna spend a lot of time on it.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.760]   But you're building a life
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.840]   and there's a lot of different aspects of your life
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   like pinball tournaments and doing hot tub pie.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.160]   - Hot tub tournament.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.600]   Well, we're not gonna turn them hot tub,
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.440]   but we're gonna pinball hot tub sauna,
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.840]   cold plunge after this.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.920]   But the thing I would say
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.880]   just to kind of give people suggestions is
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.600]   it's possible and you have to start it
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.080]   'cause it's not gonna happen overnight.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.040]   It's gonna happen today.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.560]   Like when I worked at Intel,
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.840]   if other people feel this way, let me know.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.280]   I remember dreading Sundays.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.640]   I was like, oh my God, please no.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.800]   Just let me not have to work Monday ever again.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.360]   And I think it's such an interesting thing
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.400]   to reflect on how you're feeling about your week.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.520]   And if you have a job,
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.080]   you can't change your meetings necessarily.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.140]   Like it's very hard to get out of that,
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:54.680]   but you can start making changes
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.280]   that can get you out of them over time.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.640]   And I left Silicon Valley
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.360]   'cause I noticed people were so obsessed
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.360]   with this external validation.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.720]   Oh, you want a lifestyle business?
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.600]   I'm like, yeah, I want a life and a style and a business.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.540]   Oh, you're not changing the world?
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:09.380]   Guess what?
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.800]   Changing the world is by changing yourself
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.880]   and then maybe just change one person.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.440]   And I think a lot of people,
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.760]   you know, it's this external validation,
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.540]   how many subs, how much money.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.000]   And then when you actually take a step back,
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.560]   how you wanna live,
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.140]   like, okay, maybe I don't actually care about all that stuff.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.880]   Maybe I can, like for me,
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.380]   my dream and I wrote it down
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.620]   is to live half the year in Spain,
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.840]   half the year in America, in Texas,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.920]   have a dog, have some kids,
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.320]   be able to work on promoting things,
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.240]   making content, talking to smart people like yourself,
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.880]   promoting your books.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.680]   Like that's my dream, that's my life.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.200]   I think most people, like they're one,
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.840]   our lives are already pretty great.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.780]   And I think that's a good way
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.480]   to already be happy with our lives.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.880]   'Cause it's not like if I finally get there,
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.160]   I'm gonna be happier or my life will be complete.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.240]   You'll still be yourself.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.260]   But you can't get to a point,
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:56.160]   I promise you everyone out there.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.000]   And I think about it, I'm like,
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.840]   I can't believe this is my life.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.680]   And I'm like, wow, you know what?
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.600]   Everyone else can do this too.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.760]   It's not some exclusive club.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:07.180]   And you know, I think about people that are like,
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.500]   and I know them, they're like, oh, you know, I can't do it.
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.540]   And I'm like, take your power and do something today.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.380]   - Yeah.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.280]   - 'Cause maybe you don't like where you live,
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.040]   maybe you don't like your job, maybe you don't like hate.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:16.860]   But guess what?
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.380]   If you start today, in five years,
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.640]   you're gonna thank yourself for listening to Cal Newport,
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.040]   I know, and then you tried it today, you got going,
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.680]   maybe didn't work, but you tried again and again and again,
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.000]   and then it started working.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.160]   In five years from now, where could you be?
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.760]   And even your work could you be?
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.580]   - So it's something people get paralyzed by is they say,
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.440]   I don't have the full vision yet.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.280]   Okay, I agree.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.640]   Like, I don't wanna just get the external validation.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.520]   I don't have the full vision yet, so I can't start.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:44.200]   But one of your ideas is your vision for what matters
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.080]   gets refined as you start paying more attention
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   and trying to do more that matters.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.160]   It's like for you, for example,
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.020]   and maybe we'll use you as a case study.
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.440]   What was the path from you're at Intel,
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.720]   you know you don't like it, to your current situation
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.280]   where you've engineered, you just explained it to us.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.280]   It's an intentional life that has a lot
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.240]   of very intentional specific aspects to it.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.840]   I'm assuming at Intel, you did not write down
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.320]   on a piece of paper all of these aspects
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.620]   that you wanted in your life.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.440]   So tell us a little bit about how you evolved
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.720]   from I don't like this to I really have a good sense
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.580]   of what I like.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.280]   - It takes time and I would encourage everyone
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.080]   positive self-talk, consistent positive self-talk.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.160]   Like when you say a negative thing about yourself,
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.920]   say something positive and be patient with yourself.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.100]   Because I made it very hard on myself and very,
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.400]   and I think if you're an academic,
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.040]   if you're an entrepreneur, if you're an intelligent person,
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.980]   I think you have high standards.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.840]   And so it's constantly like, kind of for me,
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.360]   being like the worst, and I'm like the worst coach
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.120]   of myself for so long.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:45.520]   And I've really worked on how do I just be more positive
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.520]   about who I am to myself, separate if the book sells well,
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.340]   separate if I come on a show or not.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.640]   And then that's a practice.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.820]   And so when I was at Intel,
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.680]   I think there's categories of our life, right?
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.280]   So there's your work life, there's your friends,
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.440]   there's your living, there's your relationships.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.120]   And really, I think most people are actually
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.780]   pretty self-aware of what part of their life
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.160]   isn't satisfactory.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.680]   I don't think there's a secret out there.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.640]   I think most people understand it, but it's a little hard.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.520]   And so at Intel, I was like, I hate this job.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.360]   - Yeah.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.000]   - I hate this job.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.600]   And that was great motivator.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.840]   And then I hated being at Facebook to some of it,
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.120]   even though it was a great experience.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.820]   And over time, I just kept,
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.380]   then I finally got to start my own business
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.640]   and I hated my partners, or they probably hated me too.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:29.720]   And I hated making Facebook games.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:32.080]   But each of these things encourage,
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.360]   you take a little bit of courage,
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.320]   that builds your confidence,
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.880]   and that happened through action.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.760]   - Yep.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.600]   - That happens through action.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.600]   Like you can only plan for so long,
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.880]   but then traffic accidents happen.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.380]   You didn't plan for that.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.560]   And so you have to adjust.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.160]   And so all these steps, Intel, then Facebook, then Mint,
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.160]   then this gaming company, I hate games.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.280]   I only play chess, that's the only game I like.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.700]   And then I didn't like these partners.
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:54.880]   And then I was like, I also wanted to have a company
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.720]   that I'd love to do all day for the rest of my life.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.120]   That's why I don't care to go IPO or sell this business.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:00.960]   - Yeah.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.840]   - And that's what AppSumo started as.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.340]   And that was just one aspect.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.800]   And I think it took time in each of these categories,
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:07.960]   even relationships.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.680]   You know, in the book, we talk very deeply
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.920]   about how the power of asking is so important,
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.980]   and it's a skill everyone needs to get better at.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.600]   Because in relationships, in terms of life intentionality,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.680]   having a great partner is the number one life upgrade.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.620]   If number one is yourself,
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.640]   I'd say it's tied for improving yourself
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.740]   and how you feel about yourself and having a partner,
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.460]   number one life in the world.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.420]   And I would just get what I was getting.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.260]   And my business partner is like,
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.220]   if you got to ask and you can get what you want,
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.060]   and you have to think about what you want,
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.140]   and then you have to ask for it.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.820]   And I would say that was another really key thing
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.400]   intentionally where it was like,
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.980]   well, she doesn't have a job.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.860]   I want someone with a job.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.680]   She really criticizes me a lot
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.400]   for doing social media and YouTube.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.300]   Okay, that's not really working.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.780]   She, you know, each one, you know,
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.140]   these failures are learning opportunities
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.420]   where they keep getting better and better and better
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.960]   until I finally met someone where it's like, oh my God.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.760]   And I think I had the misconception though,
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.860]   you meet someone and then it's over,
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.020]   you don't have to do anything.
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.540]   But no, it's like still work every day.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.940]   It's still showing up.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.740]   And in all these aspects of my life,
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.460]   I finally got to a part where one,
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.220]   I think I could have been happier with myself all along.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.260]   I think that's an important message.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.700]   But then now being at a place
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.780]   where I'm very content with it,
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.340]   also just being like, okay, you actually are content.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.900]   You don't have to keep chasing.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.920]   Just be good with internal.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.380]   - All right, let's take another quick break here.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.220]   I'm proud to say that the show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.340]   So one of the key aspects of trying to cultivate
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:37.020]   a deep life is to make sure that your relationship
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.020]   with your own brain is healthy.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.080]   If you are wracked by ruminations,
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.220]   be them anxious or depressive ruminations,
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.100]   or you have fears that are getting in the way
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.760]   of you doing the things that you know
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.100]   that you should be doing to live a better life,
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.080]   consider giving therapy a try.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.600]   It could be an important tool in the toolkit you are using
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.040]   to build a deeper life.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.860]   Now, one of the big barriers to entry for therapy
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.880]   is figuring out how do I even get started here?
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.420]   How do I find a therapist?
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.560]   What if it's too expensive?
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.400]   What if I don't like the therapist?
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.620]   This is where BetterHelp enters the scene.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:17.480]   They make access to therapy much easier.

[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.460]   You'll get matched with a licensed therapist.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.540]   If it's not a great fit,
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.500]   you can switch to a different therapist at any time
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.160]   for no additional charge.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.140]   So learn to make time for what makes you happy

[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.440]   I also wanna talk about our longtime friends at ZocDoc.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.660]   ZocDoc is a free app and website
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.120]   where you can search and compare
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.540]   highly rated in-network doctors near you
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:05.100]   and instantly book appointments with them online.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.580]   ZocDoc is one of these services
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.920]   that just makes so much sense.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.220]   I can't believe it didn't exist before, right?
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.880]   I need a doctor for whatever's going on.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.100]   I need a particular type of doctor.
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.200]   How do I find a doctor?
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.320]   Well, up until now, this has been very difficult.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.200]   You Google or you just talk to random friends.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.800]   Hey, do you have a good podiatrist, you know?
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.280]   And you hope to find one.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.120]   You call them up.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.880]   They're like, "Oh, you think we have appointments,"
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.120]   or they don't take your insurance,
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.300]   and it's all complicated.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.280]   ZocDoc makes that simpler.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.240]   You can search for them.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.160]   Looking for doctors in this area, this type of specialist,
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.660]   that takes my insurance and has appointments available.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.320]   Even better, once you find a doctor
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.060]   that fits all those criteria,
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:51.560]   they also have verified reviews from actual real patients.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.920]   You can figure out, is this doctor even any good?
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.080]   And then you can use the app or service
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.140]   to book the appointments.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.600]   Not only that, you know,
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.760]   I have two different doctors that use ZocDoc.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.600]   They use it as well as an easy way
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   to fill out paperwork ahead of appointments
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.560]   so you can move quicker when you get there.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.500]   ZocDoc is really using technology
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.720]   to make the healthcare process much easier and smoother.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.860]   So it's a fantastic idea.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.460]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.980]   and download the ZocDoc app for free.
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.280]   Then you can go ahead and find a book
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.300]   at Top Rated Doctor today.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.980]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.440]   ZocDoc.com/deep.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.960]   All right, let's get back to it.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.840]   And it's just through recognizing these different areas.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.000]   And there's still stuff.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.760]   I got super mad at someone this week.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.440]   It was just, it was kind of silly.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.680]   And I was really frustrated with myself all week about it.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.000]   And I was mad that this person I thought cheated me.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.880]   And I was talking with my friend and he was like,
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.200]   "Hmm, you know, what would your daughter think
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.480]   "about this behavior that you're doing?"
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.360]   I was like, "Oh, that's a good one."
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.200]   - That's a good one.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.020]   - I was like, "Well, I'd want to show her
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.920]   "that I could be the better man and let this go
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.600]   "and then move on to more positive things."
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.560]   I was like, "Oh, damn, that's good, but I'm still angry."
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.680]   So I let it go.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.920]   And then, yeah, but again, I'm saying that it's still,
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.660]   there's still problems, there's still different challenges,
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.200]   but it's just being content across all these different areas
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.040]   yourself, your work, your relationship,
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.520]   probably where you're living.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.560]   I was living in a shitty house or cheap houses
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.400]   for, I don't know, 20 years.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.220]   I lived on floors.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.560]   Like literally, I lived on floors for a year
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.720]   'cause it was so cheap.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.340]   And then I finally bought like a multimillion dollar house
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.920]   during COVID 'cause I was like, "I finally, let me try."
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.400]   I tried it out, I experimented.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.340]   I was like, "Yo, this is amazing."
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.560]   My previous house is 800 square feet, it's cracked.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.120]   Floors are literally cracked as well as the walls,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.760]   it's got cockroaches, it's pretty bad.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.280]   And then during COVID, I tried out nice houses
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.360]   and I was like, "Oh my God, I can actually,
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.280]   "I think I can deserve this for myself and I can afford it."
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.940]   And then as I tested it, I loved it, bought it,
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.280]   and I'm so blessed.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.720]   I love this house.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.480]   And that's all the different kind of pieces
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.740]   and that's your schedule, calendar as well.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:02.180]   I don't think any of these are secret elements,
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.400]   but it's being mindful across the spectrum
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.080]   and then making those adjustments
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.980]   and being patient that it can take some time.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.160]   - Well, I like that calendar advice you have because,
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.820]   so later this last chapter of the book, chapter nine,
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.560]   where you're talking about integrating this
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.960]   into a bigger picture of your life,
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.580]   you're suggesting being pretty systematic
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.980]   about making sure there's time being invested
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:25.880]   to different aspects of your life that's important.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.720]   - Yes.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.280]   And part of that, I'm assuming, based on this conversation,
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.840]   is that also makes sure not just that you're spending time
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.800]   on the different parts of your life that are important,
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.160]   you're continuing to learn about each of those parts.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.000]   So you have a relationship part.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   Now you're learning about what you want
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.240]   or how to succeed in a relationship.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.480]   You have a part just for yourself, non-professional.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.160]   If you're not regular spending time now,
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.000]   you don't know what it is that you wanna do
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.020]   when something else is doing better.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.800]   I love that idea of, and you use colors, right?
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.120]   You said, "Use different colors
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.440]   "for the events on your calendars."
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.080]   You can just see, hey, there's no blue
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.000]   on the calendar this week.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.760]   This is out of whack.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.000]   But I love thinking about that as a curriculum almost.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.680]   It's a self-learning curriculum
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.360]   as much as it is trying to build a balanced schedule.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.960]   - Yeah, so just for the people out there,
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.700]   if you had, you know, I break it down in the book,
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.220]   at a high level, it's, you know,
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:19.800]   most people have 24 hours in a day.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.520]   I don't know, maybe you're a different Cal.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.420]   Then why is it that some people seem to get more done
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.860]   and seem to be more satisfied with what gets done?
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   And it's because they're working backwards from clarity.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.160]   That's the only difference.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.000]   It's the only difference.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.600]   They're very clear where they're trying to go,
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.140]   and then they're prioritizing accordingly.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.260]   So the way that's worked for me,
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.640]   I've done this at the same method,
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.440]   the color coding and stuff is definitely involved
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.860]   in the past decade.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.220]   But have a clear goal where you're gonna end the year.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.920]   Have clear weekly outcomes that you wanna do,
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.940]   and those weekly outcomes,
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.400]   which should match to your yearly ones,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.100]   then break those down on a daily basis.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.560]   And I like a lot of,
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.380]   the best things in my calendar are almost always audio,
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.580]   or auto, excuse me.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.580]   So I mean that they're automatically, they're color coded.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.720]   So I can see, hey, I've like, even this week,
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.460]   I don't have, I hurt myself,
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.860]   so I'm not doing as much green,
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.180]   and my green is my workouts.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.020]   - Yep.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.380]   - Huh, that's interesting, or relationship.
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.980]   So each week I have a relationship goal,
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.440]   like things I wanna do with my girlfriend,
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.140]   then wow, there's relationship activities
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.340]   that I then scheduled.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.720]   So it's intentional about what's gonna happen
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.940]   versus surprised.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.860]   And it doesn't mean that every single second of every day
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.180]   has to be allocated, but at least in these areas,
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.720]   you know you're going towards the directions
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.560]   that you wanna do.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.420]   So being on shows, yeah, I'm hanging out with Cal Newport.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.640]   And I wanna make sure I have some light green,
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.580]   which is being and talking about the book,
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.660]   and being, connecting with people.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.700]   And so it's a very quick way
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.300]   that I can literally just glance right now
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.940]   and see where am I spending more time,
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.020]   and where am I spending less.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.020]   - I mean, it sounds simple, but people don't do it.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:46.840]   It's, well, I don't know.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.260]   I worked a lot, I did a lot of phone time, right?
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.740]   If you could go back and auto color code people's calendars,
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:57.300]   they'd be not very happy by how out of whack that is.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.140]   I know we're short on time,
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:01.260]   but I just wanted to ask you, just because I have you here,
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.340]   unrelated to the book, I'm just curious,
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.820]   Facebook employee 30, what was it like there at that time?
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:08.660]   What year was that?
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.480]   What was it like there?
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.500]   I'm just curious.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.980]   - Man, it was the best.
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:13.800]   It was the best.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.820]   It was 2005.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.660]   - 2005, ooh.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.500]   - Right, so just when it got started.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.880]   - Early, yeah.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.100]   - It's super early.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.300]   Even at Million Dollar Weekend, I have the story
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.380]   about the day I got fired, which was traumatic.
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.240]   And if you haven't gotten fired,
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.580]   I recommend it to everyone.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.580]   It's a good learning lesson.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.500]   And what was beautiful about it though, Cal,
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.440]   there was a lot of, I feel so lucky
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.520]   that I got to have so many learnings being at Facebook,
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.620]   like working directly for Mark
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.980]   and seeing how big of a vision he had,
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.580]   that he hired coaches early on,
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.300]   that his focus is actually a focus.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.700]   He's like, we're only trying to grow the site.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.780]   I don't care about making money.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.220]   And I'd always bring him money-making ideas.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.060]   (laughs)
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:47.900]   He got really annoyed.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.140]   He's like, and he wrote on a whiteboard, billion.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.540]   - Yeah.
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.660]   - And he's like, we're gonna get to a billion people.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.500]   That's it.
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.340]   Don't talk to me if you're not helping me
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.340]   get to a billion people.
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.400]   And I was like, oh, that was good.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.940]   And he just had a great vision.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.460]   Like most people, your vision doesn't have to be,
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.300]   doesn't have to be anything,
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.220]   but it has to be exciting for yourself.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.220]   And he's like, hey, I'm gonna connect
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.020]   every single person on this planet.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.340]   24 years old, saying stuff like that?
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.140]   And let me be clear.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.860]   One, he did try two other businesses you've never heard of,
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.940]   Facemash and Wirehog.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.100]   So he's trying.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.620]   And by the way, he started a weekend copying someone else.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.640]   - Yep.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.420]   - So don't innovate, just iterate.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.300]   That's what he did.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.380]   Look, it's a $2 trillion business, not bad.
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.940]   - I was gonna say, by the way,
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.460]   I love this vision of like 2005,
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.300]   Noah Kagan going up to Mark Zuckerberg
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.900]   and be like, Mark, if we sold t-shirts,
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.560]   we could make a million dollars, all right?
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.860]   So I think this is what we need to focus on.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.180]   I just love that idea.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.180]   - Do you realize we have 100,000 subscribers on this site?
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.780]   If we sold t-shirts to just 10% of them.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.940]   - Well, I think that was a good teaching moment
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:58.300]   from him about focus, but also his strategy at that point,
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.280]   which I thought was smart, and subsequently,
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.740]   was that if we get a bigger distribution channel,
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.620]   then monetization is a lot easier
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.980]   versus focusing on monetization.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.940]   This is all coming back to doubling down.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.100]   Like we do monetization,
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.040]   we're gonna probably be sacrificing the distribution channel.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.880]   - Yeah.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.080]   - Yeah, okay, that's good.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.440]   Being around excellence,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.820]   being around people with exceedingly high standards
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.160]   where everyone had already high standards
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.580]   and then there's people that have even higher,
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.820]   and just having that on a regular basis.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:31.180]   And then the level of urgency
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.000]   and the fact that we're working on something
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.580]   that was just critical.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.340]   And that was special.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.280]   I hope everyone gets to experience these hyper growth
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.260]   kind of, wow, doing something that people really want,
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.620]   and those are great businesses to be a part of.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.820]   And they don't have to be as size of Facebook,
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:50.400]   but they can be, like Mint did it, AppSumo did it,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.720]   this book seems to be doing it.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.140]   You can do it at whatever size you want.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.160]   I would say, though, if you can find ways,
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.960]   either through earbuds, like we're doing with the podcast
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.580]   and the show, find yourself,
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.000]   how can you be around other people like this?
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:03.840]   People that are saying,
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.340]   "Hey, I think you could be a little better here."
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.020]   Or even asking people for that feedback.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:10.720]   Right now, today, there was a lot of great things
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.920]   that I was fortunate to be able to get there.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.240]   Did you also, oh, sorry.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.080]   At Mint and Facebook,
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.700]   did you also learn the negative advice of,
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.180]   "Oh, hyper growth is not really what I want to do."
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.960]   Like you also got to see,
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.640]   this is what hyper growth venture-backed companies are like.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.720]   Okay, great, now I know that's not what I want to do.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.160]   Like IPO is not what I, which is valuable, right?
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.360]   Negative insight is also valuable, I assume.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.040]   - Yeah, ooh, I like that a lot.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.340]   I think people have heard that,
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.760]   but I don't know if they ever do it.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.740]   They're like, "Yeah, try a lot of things
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.800]   "you don't like to find out what you do."
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.380]   You know, at Facebook, I've read my old journals,
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.720]   and I just remember when we got larger,
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.680]   which sounds ironic, we were only 150 people,
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.800]   which is almost the size of AppSumo today,
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.680]   I remember really being frustrated
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.040]   that we'd have a lot of meetings.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.480]   (laughing)
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.000]   And I was like, "Can we just do work?"
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.720]   And so I learned that.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.040]   I felt very insecure at that time.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:04.980]   I was like, man, these guys are,
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.880]   there's MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Stanford.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.720]   It was like elite of the elite.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.980]   And I just, it was a very insecure feeling daily,
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.760]   which also probably means you're growing.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.020]   And yeah, I learned a lot of good things
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:16.860]   about how to run a company.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:19.140]   And also, one day there was a guy named Dan
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.760]   who died on a freak bike accident,
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.720]   and everyone just went back to work.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.460]   And I was like, that's frickin' bullshit.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.060]   Like this guy died, and he was special to us,
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:28.900]   and he mattered, and he helped,
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.800]   and we're just going back to work.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.580]   There's definitely a lot of negative things
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.380]   that I didn't admire that I wanted to do better
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.860]   in my own company, and that was cool.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:39.660]   That's all that you're teaching people, Cal, which is great.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.380]   You can create the life you wanna live,
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.340]   and it's not as hard as you think it is.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.940]   - Yeah, and it's also not easy.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:48.040]   It's just take persistent effort.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.740]   It's easy, there's no one step that's impossible
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.300]   that you might not succeed with.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.460]   But there's also just no one step
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.500]   that makes the whole thing happen.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.380]   This seems to be the takeaway from this,
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.680]   is yeah, there's not some impossible obstacle
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.240]   at some point where you're gonna get stuck,
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.340]   but there is like 1,000 steps.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.640]   So if you're not, like start walking
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.620]   and have a pretty good map for the trail you're following,
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.860]   you're not gonna get there.
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.060]   But you know how to walk, and if you keep walking,
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.620]   eventually you will get there.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.760]   Yeah, so it's no step is hard, but there's a lot.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.860]   So you better start racking them up, metaphor time.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:20.700]   - Exactly, man.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.860]   I mean, I think you're a great example for writing books.
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:24.800]   Like you write a book, and then you write a book,
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.940]   and then you write a book, and I'm assuming you enjoy it.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.500]   And for everyone out there,
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.140]   what's this first step they can take today?
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.420]   - Yeah, I mean, I decided when I was 20 years old,
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.120]   this is what I wanna do, I wanna write books.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.880]   And whatever book I could write, I wrote that first.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.140]   And then I tried to make the next one better,
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.520]   and the next one better, and that's all I've done.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.560]   20 years later, this is all I've done.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.880]   It's like, I just wanna keep writing books,
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.400]   just clarity on that.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.800]   Keep doing something, you learn about it,
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.360]   you learn how to direct, and how to avoid the pitfalls,
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.480]   and it's funny how that unfolds.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.440]   Like I was talking to someone, a well-known person,
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.400]   a lot of subs, a big online personality,
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.000]   and I was like, oh, that's really cool what you're doing.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.840]   And he was like, no, no, my dream is what you're doing.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.720]   So you never know, they write books, you know,
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.040]   like they write books, and people know your ideas,
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.920]   and you can just sit there, and yeah.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.920]   And it was just execute, let me write another.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.000]   That was always my thing, write another, sell another,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.840]   work it out, sell another, just keep going.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.080]   - You know, and I think one of the important lessons
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.600]   that I looked on lifestyle engineering was,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.120]   I was talking with Charlie Hoenn,
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.260]   he was an editor of this book,
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.660]   and he's got great stuff out there.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.000]   - I know Charlie, yeah.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.520]   - Yeah, I love Charlie, he's been a good longtime friend.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.680]   One of my guardian angels.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.320]   I have a few of these guardian angels in my life.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.020]   And I remember talking to him, like, you know,
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.520]   Jeff Bezos, who I think is so cool,
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.000]   and he's built this company, he doesn't have a podcast.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.440]   And he's like, Noah, you're not Jeff Bezos,
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.000]   you're Noah Kagan.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.160]   And you could do it the Noah Kagan way.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.680]   I was like, oh, that's spicy.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.280]   And that's for everyone, that's the Cal Newport way,
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.940]   that's your way, whatever your name is, listening,
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.360]   and embracing that.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.400]   Like you can have a podcast and a YouTube and a family
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.980]   and all these things, or you can have just one thing,
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:04.820]   and that's great too.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.520]   And recognizing that that's how it can be
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.400]   was also very liberating for me,
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.320]   that I was like, ah, I can have a YouTube and podcast,
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.960]   and Cal, I'm only writing one book.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.920]   I don't know how you did multiple.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.240]   I'm one and done, my man.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.480]   This is what I'm gonna be talking about
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.120]   for the next decade.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.920]   But that works for me, and I'm very satisfied with that.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.860]   - Well, I love it.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.320]   Well, Noah, I know I've held you over,
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.160]   but I just love talking about this.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.800]   Thanks for coming on.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.040]   Million Dollar Weekend, look, I recommend this book
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.400]   for all you deep lifers out there.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400]   This is not just about, though it is,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.600]   what actually works in making a successful business.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.360]   I really do think it is a blueprint
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.560]   for how do you explore the adjacent possible,
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.640]   the configurations of what your life could and couldn't be,
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.800]   and systematically navigate towards something better.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.400]   That's the key, systematic.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.560]   This is the long game, not the I solve it all
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.960]   with one big idea that I have tomorrow
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.680]   or with one big moment of courage.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.720]   So no, I'm not surprised your book is doing really well
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.840]   because I've learned from my listeners, people want this.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.960]   So thanks for coming on and talking to us about it.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.760]   - Thanks for having me.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.120]   - You might also like episode 272,
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.720]   where I did an interview with the writer David Epstein.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.840]   It was a great conversation.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.960]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.800]   Check it out.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.120]   The goal for today's deep dive is to go through
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:26.040]   four essential tools that you need to build
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.360]   your productivity toolkit.
