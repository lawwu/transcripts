[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   I just got back from a month spent up at my undisclosed location up north.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.400]   I went up there in part to cultivate a quieter mind so I could think deeply about the new
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.920]   book I'm writing and unwind.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.760]   Our nation's political news, however, had a different plan for me.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.160]   It was early in my trip that we had that fateful Joe Biden debate performance.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.640]   My trip ended with the current president bowing out of the ongoing race, and somewhere in
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.060]   between there was an assassination attempt.
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.980]   In other words, for a DC resident trying to go get away from distractions, the most distracting
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.400]   possible stuff was happening, and it all fit exactly within the 25 days that I was up in
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.780]   my undisclosed location.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.280]   So I thought this was a good excuse to talk about a topic that a lot of you have actually
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   written me about in recent days, which is how do you focus during distracting times?
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.040]   So that's what I want to do today.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.260]   I have six pieces of advice as well as two initial caveats for thinking about the role
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.400]   of focus and concentration in times where there's distractions that are crossing past
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.240]   the normal threshold and to a place where they can be almost crippling in their ability
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.040]   to grab and keep grabbing your attention and drain your energy.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.080]   So focus in distracting times.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.800]   Let's get concrete about what to do here.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.400]   I want to start with a caveat.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   So the goal is not to be an automaton grimly working deeply while Rome burns around you,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.560]   okay?
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.480]   During an acute breaking news event, while the event is still unfolding, I think it is
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.340]   completely fine to say, "I'm not working today," right?
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.760]   If the event seems highly salient or important or historic, be it something that's happening
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.560]   in the larger world or an upheaval happening in your own personal life, something is happening
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.920]   to someone you know or to where you live or it's a weather event or whatever it is, don't
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.480]   try to work while it's going on.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.680]   Don't do like, "I'm kind of working, not very well, but really this other disruptive thing
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.680]   is going on."
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.920]   It's completely fine to say, "I am going to figure out what is going on.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.440]   I am going to follow the news.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.360]   I'm going to spend some time just processing the information," okay?
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.780]   This is where you might say, "I'm going to rabbit hole on everything I can read online
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.840]   while this is happening."
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.200]   This is where you might say, "I'm just going to disappear for a few hours to go for a walk
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.160]   and process my emotions based on some big disruptive news I just got."
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   That is all fine.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.480]   And in fact, the very reason why we have a hard time with this notion of like, "Hey,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.560]   if something huge is happening, don't work that day," the very reason we have a hard
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.360]   time with that idea comes back to a concept from my book, Slow Productivity, the concept
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.640]   that I call pseudo productivity.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.720]   This is actually an indicator of pseudo productivity's insidious grip.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.080]   What is pseudo productivity?
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.540]   It is the idea that we use visible activity as our primary proxy for useful effort.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.840]   It's endemic throughout office and knowledge style work.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.600]   It is exactly that mindset that troubles us with the idea of, "I'm going to take a break
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.400]   from work because something big is happening."
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.960]   Because in a pseudo productivity regime, all that matters is visible activity, so it is
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.160]   very risky and visible to not be doing visible work.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.100]   However, if you embrace slow productivity, like I argue in my book, Slow Productivity,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.760]   you care much more about quality results over time.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.480]   And in that context, you realize, "I can't make any reasonable progress towards anything
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.920]   quality while this huge breaking news event is happening today, so why would I even bother
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   trying?"
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.040]   When you care about productivity at a big time scale, it's not that difficult.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.320]   It's not that avant-garde or radical to say, "Something big just happened, so let me focus
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.960]   on that and not work at all."
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   All right?
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.720]   So that's my first caveat.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.160]   During the immediate aftermath of a big event or during breaking news itself, slow productivity
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.360]   says, "It's fine not to work," and in fact, you're just doing a show, you're putting on
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.680]   a show if you try to.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.000]   So all the advice I have going forward is not about when something's acutely happening,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.700]   but the days after, right?
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.640]   It's not like in my example, oh, there's this disastrous debate happening.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.880]   It's the three days after, four days after, five days after, where now it's just chatter,
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   chatter, chatter.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.240]   The acute thing's not happening.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.840]   Now it's just people making things up, people having ideas, prognostication, rumors, and
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.560]   leaks, right?
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.760]   That is where you can have this long-term destabilization of your focus.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   That's where I want to focus.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   All right.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.920]   Now, let me, again, before we get to the six pieces of advice, let me give you a foundation
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.320]   for the six pieces of advice that are going to follow.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   I want to give you two quotes from a book.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.560]   It's influential to me.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.200]   Winifred Gallagher's 2009 book, Wrapped, R-A-P-T.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.800]   Two key quotes from Gallagher that are going to sort of set the foundation for the advice
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.720]   that follows.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.200]   Quote number one, "Life is the sum of what you focus on."
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.080]   Quote number two, "Living the focused life is not about trying to feel happy all the
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   time.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.400]   Rather, it's about treating your mind as you would a private garden and being as careful
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.040]   as possible about what you introduce and allow to grow there."
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.200]   Gallagher is hitting the foundation of the advice that follows, which says, "Your experience
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.120]   of the world is determined by what you pay attention to."
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.400]   So especially during periods where there are many things to pay attention to that are going
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.320]   to give you a grim or urgent or anxiety-producing understanding of the world, this is when it's
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.000]   most important to be very careful about your attention, to treat your mind like a private
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.760]   garden and not let all of these diversionary weeds take root.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   All right.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.720]   So with that caveat and foundation in mind, six pieces of advice for focusing during distracted
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.440]   times.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.840]   Tip number one, go into what I call newspaper mode.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:16.680]   And what I mean by newspaper mode is I'm actually imagining, for the sake of an example, earlier
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.200]   time periods in which the printed newspaper was your only mode of receiving new information
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.480]   about anything happening outside of your immediate vicinity.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   Let's think, for example, like colonial America, 18th century America, Benjamin Franklin times.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   There was newspapers, right?
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.400]   The news would come in, they would print what they had, you could read the paper, whatever
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.300]   the primary paper, maybe there was two competing papers in your colonial town.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.600]   Now you knew everything you could learn that day about what was going on around the country
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.880]   and the world.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.680]   And there was really no new information to get until the next edition of the paper came
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.680]   out.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.160]   That's the mode you should go into during distracting news periods in our modern times
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.600]   as well.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.640]   Here is going to be my sort of daily ingestion of relevant information.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.920]   Outside of that, I'll be okay.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.000]   I can let everything else aggregate, be filtered and thought about before that, and then the
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.320]   next day I can check in once again with what's going on.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.200]   If that was good enough for Samuel Adams and Benjamin Franklin and John Adams and Thomas
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.000]   Jefferson during the ultimate American breaking news event, which was incipient revolution
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.960]   against the Brits, then it's good enough for you today, trying to know what's going on
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.640]   with a presidential campaign.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.920]   People get nervous about this, but remember, you're not Anderson Cooper.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.360]   You don't need to have like this up to the minute breaking news.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.440]   I've heard this rumor I'm interviewing.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.840]   I think people feel like they're cable news producers when these breaking news events
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   hold.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.240]   They're gathering all this information as if they're in front of an audience trying
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.480]   to help people make sense of things.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.720]   You're not Anderson Cooper.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.840]   The world will be okay if you're not completely up to speed on what's going on with a presidential
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.000]   campaign to which you have no direct impact or control.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.480]   So you'll be okay.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.960]   Social media makes people feel like they can be breaking news producers.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   You don't need to be.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   All right.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.600]   Tip number two, move up the information food chain.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.160]   So remember back in school, they used to talk about the food chain and it was sort of pyramidal.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:39.080]   You had this sort of base of a really big base of algaes and plants that survive off
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.120]   of sunlight and convert it to energy.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.480]   And then you had smaller things like in the ocean, you would have smaller things like
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.120]   krill, et cetera, that would eat the algaes.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.000]   And there's like a lot of them, but less.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.240]   And then slightly bigger fish would eat those and a bigger fish would eat those.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.800]   And as you moved up the food chain, you got less and less animals.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.200]   It was sort of like concentrating the original energy.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.320]   I think about online information in the same way.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.640]   At the bottom, the digital information equivalent of algae is just chatter on social media.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:16.080]   It's just lots of information, a lot of angling for clout or for attention of all sorts of
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.280]   like mixed quality, huge amounts of redundancy.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.700]   It's just sort of these massive proverbial algae mats of just stuff.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.400]   And then as you move up the information food chain, this information gets digested and
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:36.840]   reconstituted into larger sort of more highly caloric sources, if we're going to be sort
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.800]   of follow our metaphor here.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.480]   So you have like everyone just, I saw this, what about this?
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.480]   What's going on?
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   A lot of people's opinions.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.160]   And then maybe that gets aggregated in the people of more influence, but are still kind
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.480]   of making takes based on what they're seeing.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.800]   And then that itself gets integrated into news articles to do all sorts of other sorts
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.360]   of verified fact checking.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.480]   And then there's sort of the analysis pieces that are reading those articles and you sort
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.640]   of move up this food chain and things get more processed and more clarified and more
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.720]   purified.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.920]   Move up the information food chain during these periods of breaking news.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.600]   Don't read the algae mass of just nonsense.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.960]   That means TikTok, that means Twitter, that's going to be Instagram, that's good.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:27.000]   That you need higher quality, more concentrated calorie sources for what you're going to consume.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   All right.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So go higher quality.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.540]   So that's probably going to mean major newspapers.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.600]   Maybe you have like an independent media source you really trust, like a particular commentator
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.080]   who has a newsletter or a podcast and you have a relationship with that independent
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   news source.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.360]   So like you have one of those, maybe one or two major newspapers that you're sampling
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   some articles from.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.200]   You want the higher quality stuff during breaking news.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.000]   Because it's smaller, it's more self-contained.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.200]   You can't follow that like you can the lower quality, lower caloric sources that there's
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   just endless.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.480]   If there's endless mats of this information, you can swim among that algae forever.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.920]   There's only so many, you know, your independent news source that you trust.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.400]   This is their newsletter they did today.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   That's it.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.000]   The newspaper you're following, here's their three articles on this.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That's it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.600]   So it's not as conducive to being lost for extended periods of time and consumption.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.720]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.220]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:28.680]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.120]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.480]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.280]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   Check it out.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   All right.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.360]   Tip number three, seek out flow states.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:53.120]   What I mean by that is seek out activities, both professional and personal, that you can
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120]   get lost in.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120]   Right?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   So like creative projects, going out on adventures, getting lost in a movie or a good book, playing
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.320]   board games with others, athletic pursuits and training, et cetera.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.240]   Find ways to get lost in what you're doing, to enter what my Haley Chicks at Mihaly would
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.280]   call a flow state.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.280]   Why is this important?
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.320]   Well, part of what happens during these breaking news moments is that your mind has a sort
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.120]   of anxious rumination that creates chemicals.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.200]   You feel it as like a background hum of anxiety.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.080]   Getting lost in an unrelated activity is like a cleaning pass.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.040]   You're cleaning out those chemicals, right?
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.720]   It's like we're going to come in and power wash the brain here a little bit, reset what
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.040]   the chemicals are going on.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.200]   It's very good for, especially to get out of the cognitive shock of something really
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.720]   big and anxiety producing happening.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.160]   It really helps you keep on top of the negative chemicals that that generates.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.600]   All right.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:56.040]   Tip number four, implement a hard day protocol, HDP.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.480]   This is something I have used many times for many different occasions in my life.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.320]   We've talked about it before on the show, but it's a very pragmatic combination of ideas
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.280]   from both cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   Here's how it works.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.520]   So there's a thing that is this acute source of stress for you.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.040]   Breaking news event is an acute source of stress for you in your life.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.760]   It's the hurricane is moving up the coast and some of the tracks show it coming towards
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.600]   your city and it's, you know, I am so anxious about this, right?
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.040]   Or whatever it is.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.720]   Hard day protocol says you get two check-ins a day, right?
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.240]   So first one is earlier in the day.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   You do a check-in, you get the information you have, and then you do some cognitive behavioral
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   therapy.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:43.800]   So you go through and you actually identify what you would call the biggest distortions
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   in your thinking.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.000]   Well, you know, you're predicting the future here.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   You're exaggerating.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.520]   You're looking at the worst case scenarios.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.120]   You're being black and white in your thinking.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.320]   So you actually push back against your thinking, point out the distortions.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.240]   You sort of end the session with like, here's the reality for better, for worse.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   Here's what happening.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   This might, this might.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.400]   If this happens, it's no problem.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.840]   If this happens, here's what we would do.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.520]   You sort of think it through in a non-distorted, calm way.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.800]   And then you shut down the thoughts on it.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.080]   Your next session will be later in the day where you can open back up, check back in
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.760]   and do similar thoughts, pointing out distortions and ending with like, here's where I stand
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   on this.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   Right.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.760]   In between those two sessions.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   And here's the magic.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.600]   When your mind ramps up chemical induced rumination, let's think about this.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.480]   Let's go back through what might happen with a hurricane.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.880]   Let's go back through with what's happening politically.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.640]   You say, I feel that.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.240]   I hear you.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.680]   But we went through this during the morning session and we ended that morning session
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.200]   shutting things down, pretty okay with the way things stood.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.080]   Like we had a good plan and we're going to check back in this evening.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.400]   So like, even if I got something wrong in that morning session, we should be more worried
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.520]   than we really are.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.200]   We'll figure that out in our pre-scheduled evening check-in, but right now I'm not going
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.560]   back to it.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.100]   This is for five o'clock whenever I've scheduled my evening check-in.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.880]   And so you're able to respond to the urge to ruminate without actually ruminating on
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.680]   the substantive details of the thing causing anxiety.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.020]   This is highly effective, especially if you're doing this for an extended period of time
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.600]   because it allows you to get out of the ruminative grooves getting deeper and deeper.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.960]   It confines your thinking to smaller points of time.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.680]   The urge to ruminate is past quicker and it can really get you out of a cycle, this sort
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.480]   of cognitive cycle of like, I can't escape thinking about it.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.680]   I call that the HDP or hard day protocol and I deploy it when there's particular acute
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   sources of stress.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.400]   But it's perfect for this breaking news, persistent distraction type setting that we're talking
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   about here.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.720]   If you're having a hard time turning your attention from it, HDP it.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:54.120]   All right, tip number five, take a break from your phone.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.320]   Clearly in these breaking news moments, it's that ability to kind of keep coming back to
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:04.360]   your phone and feeding the itch to get more information that really draws out the attention
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.240]   to stabilizing full impact of these situations.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.960]   So this is a time if there's any to say, I need to temporarily but drastically change
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.000]   my relationship with my phone.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.120]   At work and at home, you need to go hardcore on the phone for your method.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.520]   There's a place where your phone is plugged in.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.160]   If you need to use it to text someone or check messages, you go to where it's plugged in.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.440]   You need to look something up, you go to where it's plugged in.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.200]   This doesn't prevent you from using your phone, but it prevents you from having it next to
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   you.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   So you can't do the knee jerk check.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   Ooh, I'm a little anxious.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   Bored.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   Boom.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   I want to search.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   What's going on with Biden?
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   Where's the hurricane?
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   What happened?
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.880]   Any more rumors about Trump?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.280]   It's not right there for the knee jerk.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.080]   You have to get up and go somewhere else to do it.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.560]   Just that friction is going to greatly reduce the amount of times you're actually on that
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.780]   phone.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.840]   During these periods of breaking news, you're having a hard time focusing.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.600]   Take all your social media apps off of your phone.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.240]   Make sure that you are not logged in on Safari on your phone's browser.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:12.060]   If you are, log out and do not click save password when you log back in.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.520]   So you really want to put a lot of friction in terms of a phone-based check-in on social
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.520]   media.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.060]   You would have to go to the website and remember your password.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.800]   If your password is easy, make it a pain and write it down somewhere that's like up in
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   your room somewhere.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.720]   Like it really is difficult for you to log in to these services on your phone, at least
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.760]   during these periods.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.040]   And spend more time purposely without your phone accessible at all.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.860]   Drive to go somewhere for a hike and leave the phone in your glove compartment.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.800]   If your car breaks down, you still have your phone, but you don't have it with you while
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.080]   you're on your hike.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.460]   Go work at a coffee shop and leave your phone at home.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   It's very unlikely.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.320]   Again, this goes back to my prior warning.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.020]   You're not Anderson Cooper.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.120]   People don't need you to jump onto the camera because of breaking news.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.320]   You will be okay if people can't reach you for 60 to 90 minutes.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   All right.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.600]   So this is a time to drastically reduce your relationship with your phone.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.340]   Tip number six, work on something delightful.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.220]   This is a perfect time to begin work on a new project.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.600]   It could be personal or it could be professional.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   That's just exciting.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.720]   Like, I just love this.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   This is fun.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.440]   It's sort of delightful to work on.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.840]   Starting a project is great because that's like the fun part, the particularly fun part.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.120]   You're just planning and reading and researching.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.160]   You know, you're thinking through like, what if I started, maybe you have some sort of
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   fun professional idea.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.720]   What if I made like a, had some sort of online portfolio of like the art I'm doing.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.040]   In fact, is there a way to set up something on my tablet so that I could draw each day
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.680]   in this program and maybe I could use something like Zapier so that I just like press a button
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   and that gets uploaded and automatically goes and then I could have this cool portfolio
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.720]   that's updated automatically or you have some personal project you're really interested
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   in.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.400]   You're like, what if I built this like really elaborate type of animatronic for Halloween?
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.560]   Like, well, let me start thinking about what I would need and you can go down these rabbit
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.820]   holes, just have something that's delightful that is completely unrelated to the breaking
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:13.920]   news that's going on and is unrelated to any other sort of urgent or stress producing part
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.960]   of your life.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.600]   It just gives your mind again, a cleansing state to go into.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.760]   The more of these cleansing states you get into in the day, the least you let these negative
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.080]   chemicals sit around and stagnate and cause larger corrosion within your sort of persistent
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.440]   cognitive state.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.520]   All right.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   So those are my six tips.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.960]   I'll read all six real briefly here again for how to maintain some notion of focus and
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.160]   cognitive health during distracting periods of sort of distracting news periods.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:51.440]   One, go in the newspaper mode to move up the information food chain, three, seek flow states,
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:58.760]   four, implement a hard day protocol, five, take breaks from your phone and six, start
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.480]   working on something delightful.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:09.560]   So I'm sure Jesse, now that I'm home from trying to quiet my mind up north, all breaking
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.120]   news is going to stop and we'll enter just an extended period.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   You know what?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   For like the last few years, it just happened year after year, just happened to time with
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.240]   when we'd go up north.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.080]   What consistently was the thing that would inject distracted into my life?
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.360]   It was always the baseball trade deadline.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.800]   Like for the last three years, it's been the sort of dismantling of the Washington Nationals
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.280]   and the big trades that were going on.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.520]   And for multiple years, it was like this major injection of distraction.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.080]   I'd be like, okay, I'm up here, I'm just thinking, I'm relaxed, I'm away from it all.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.360]   And then boom, we're trading Juan Soto or boom, Scherzer and Trey Turner are gone.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.960]   It was like years after years, that was my main source of distraction.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.400]   And this year finally, I was like, we're well along in the rebuild.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.040]   There's no like tear down blockbuster trades going to happen.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:07.400]   Like this will finally be a calm few weeks while I'm up there and in the political universe
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   exploded.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   So it's impossible.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.720]   It's impossible to get away.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.040]   I think one of these vacations, it was like the Delta variant of COVID.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   There's always something.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.340]   There's something about the mid-summer.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.520]   So these are well-worn tips for me.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.400]   With the hikes, as you talked about in a previous episode as well, can you bring like a pet
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   like your dog?
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   That'd be great.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.400]   Okay.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.480]   Or I didn't add this tip, but another tip is like, hang out with people who just like
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.000]   are completely disconnected from the thing you're trying to get away from like, yeah,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.320]   here's my mountain biking buddies.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.320]   Like what are they?
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.040]   Well, they want to talk about mountain biking and like what's going to, you're going mountain
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   biking with them.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   That's all they want to talk about.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   That's all they want to do.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   That's good.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.360]   Like unrelated socialization.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.400]   That's difficult in Tacoma Park, DC.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.680]   If you're trying to get away from political news, because everyone here is like involved
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.400]   in politics, you know?
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.840]   I mean, it's like all around this are people who work at the white house.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   You have like Jamie Raskin lives down the street.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.560]   The Obama's former chief of staff is the other way down the street.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.920]   The head of the DNC is in the same town.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.680]   It's very difficult to get away from politics in this town.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.800]   So you got to find people that's, I think that's another good idea.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   So hopefully that's useful.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.200]   A lot of people were writing me about this.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.760]   Like I'm caught up in this political stuff and there's so much news and it seems really
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.240]   disruptive and, and I'll tell you the more time they spend in it, the more apocalyptic
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   they get.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.400]   I think that's just the way these information sources go.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.440]   And the people who manage their attention, Winifred Gallagher style during these times,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.640]   they know what's going on, but they make it through this, like it'll be okay.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.840]   And so why like waste those whole periods?
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.400]   It was like during the pandemic, the people who were like, I'll hear what I need to hear,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.160]   but I'm not going to spend a lot of time thinking about it outside of that.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.760]   Like let me just focus on the things I can control.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.460]   Like okay, my business has changed, so let me focus on like this new pivot that can work
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.460]   during this period.
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.000]   I mean, I want to know vaguely what's going on with like restrictions, but I'm not following
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   it beyond that.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I'm working on this project.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.200]   I got a dog and you know what, they were way less anxiety ridden and they, and in the end
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   things were fine.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.840]   They came out of it like nothing would have been gained for them to have been like completely
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.520]   lost in this like information echo chamber.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.120]   They hear the information they needed was like an hour a week.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.120]   What's going on now?
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   This is what we're doing.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.120]   There's a thing.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.120]   Okay, great.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   And then let me get back to like whatever.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.840]   So, you know, controlling your attention has never been more important than this digital
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.560]   age where it is so easy to be completely hijacked.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   All right.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:44.400]   So we've got some cool questions coming up, but before we do, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.760]   We actually have a brand new sponsor of the show, which I'm happy about Oracle.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.040]   So AI might be the most important new computer technology ever.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.620]   It's storming every industry and literally billions of dollars are being invested.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.080]   So buckle up.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.440]   The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed and processing power.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.420]   So how do you compete without your costs spiraling out of control?
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.960]   It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   OCI.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:22.440]   OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure, database, application development, and AI
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   needs.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:30.060]   OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds, offers one consistent price
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.880]   instead of variable regional pricing.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.680]   And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.460]   So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed and less than half the cost of other
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.460]   clouds.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:49.160]   If you want to do more and spend less like Uber or 8x8 or Databricks Mosaic, take a free
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:55.780]   test drive of OCI at oracle.com/deepquestions.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.880]   That's oracle.com/deepquestions, oracle.com/deepquestions.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:07.040]   I also want to talk about our friends at Notion.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.880]   Notion is a place where any team can write, plan, organize, and rediscover the joy of
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.380]   play.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:18.720]   It's a workspace designed not just for making progress, but getting inspired, right?
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.240]   So it's an AI powered workspace where every day, everything takes care of itself.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.360]   Meetings have summaries, docs find themselves, and every question has an answer.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.320]   Notion has long been used by fans of the show as a place to build sort of custom web-based
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.360]   tools for managing information.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.600]   You can have the information that's vital for whatever you do.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.740]   You can build these really intuitive, useful, different views for the data, different ways
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.040]   to find or manipulate the data.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.480]   I have seen everything from really big companies using Notion to build out tools for like their
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.680]   mission critical information to, and I get a lot of emails from people that do this,
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:02.560]   people's just building their own sort of geeked out custom task management systems using it.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.640]   Notion played a big role in our relationship with our ad agency here at DeepQuestions.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.240]   They built out this great tool with it for tracking ad reads, or we could see, for example,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.680]   what ad reads are coming up week by week, or we could change the view and say, give
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.200]   me all of the ad reads for this particular company.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.080]   It gave us, we could jump to an interface then to enter in the timestamps and downloads
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.380]   for that particular episode.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:30.480]   It just was a tool that super simplified dealing with all the data surrounding our ad reads.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.760]   So Notion is like incredibly versatile, but what I really like what they're doing is integrating
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:41.520]   AI increasingly native to the tool, which really makes it fun to use and it upgrades
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.040]   its ability.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.480]   The Notion AI tools help you turn knowledge into action.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.160]   You can have it like summarize the meeting notes you're storing in there, automatically
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.680]   generate action items.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.860]   You can ask it questions about your data stored in your various views, and it will give you
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.860]   those answers back.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.280]   So it's really upgrading Notion to the next level.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.760]   So you can try Notion for free when you go to notion.com/cal.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:14.040]   That's all lowercase letters, notion.com/cal and start turning ideas into action.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   And when you use our link, you'll be supporting our show.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.520]   So make sure you go to notion.com/cal.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.080]   All right, Jesse, let's get on to some questions.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.480]   Who do we got first?
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.680]   First question is from Krishna.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.760]   I'm a copywriter and work remotely.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.800]   My boss demands that I be constantly available during work.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.200]   This interrupts my deep work sessions as I'm constantly getting interrupted with notifications.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.480]   How can I deal with this?
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.880]   It'd be funny if it turned out that Krishna works for me.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.160]   Krishna, Krishna, are you doing deep work right now?
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.320]   Why aren't you answering me if you're doing deep work right now?
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.000]   You need to answer me immediately to let me know if you're doing deep work.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.080]   You know what, we're going to put a standing Zoom meeting so we can talk about why you
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.280]   need to check in with me about whether you're doing deep work right now.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.560]   Okay, Krishna, first of all, my condolences, man, I hate that.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.420]   I hate that type of management.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.220]   Anyone who has read any of my books on digital knowledge work knows that that type of management
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.560]   is annoying and counterproductive.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.440]   I'm going to give you three ideas, Krishna, just like a menu.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.800]   So depending on the reality of your work and the particular psychological makeup of this
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.820]   particular boss, you can see which of these options seems more realistic.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:35.320]   One of course is the long discussed deep to shallow work ratio conversation.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.400]   This goes all the way back to my book, Deep Work, where you sit down with your boss and
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.820]   say, hey, here's what deep work is.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.160]   Here's what shallow work is.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.200]   Both of these are important.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:50.000]   Deep work is where I do the actual copywriting, but shallow work is where you and I can discuss
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.480]   and we coordinate what I should be working on and I get updates and there's other administration
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.480]   stuff that happens.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.640]   Both are important.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.600]   What's the ideal ratio of deep to shallow work for me for my job that produced the most
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.480]   possible value for you and the company?
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.760]   Let's be positive here.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.480]   What's critical when you're talking about deep to shallow work ratios is that you make
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:17.240]   it clear that a session does not count as a deep work session if there's context switched
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.200]   in the middle of it.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.480]   So for an hour to count as an hour of deep work, it really has to be an hour of you working
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.880]   without also answering slacks or emails or calls.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.360]   You got to kind of make that clear.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.120]   The right way to talk about this, and this is drawing more from a world without email
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.760]   and slow productivity to get more into this, the right way to talk about this is cognitive
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.240]   state.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:45.320]   So the deep work cognitive state is defined in part by sustained focus, which allows the
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.600]   relevant neural networks within your brain to be activated and unrelated networks to
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   be inhibited.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.440]   And this is when you produce good work.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.600]   So if you're in a state where you're checking things or responding to things, you don't
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.320]   have that purity of focus within your brain.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.400]   So that's not deep work session.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.120]   So deep work is not determined.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.800]   This is key for this discussion.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.280]   It's not determined by the primary activity that you're doing during that time period.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.200]   It's determined by the cognitive state during that time period.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.560]   So it's got to be uninterrupted.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.600]   A lot of people have reported to me that they went into having this conversation with their
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.240]   bosses convinced that it would be a no go because they were in an office where it was
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.080]   just insisted upon that you're accessible.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   Like I can't see this possibly changing.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.720]   It's in the DNA of my boss.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.080]   And then they have this conversation and the boss is like, oh, 50/50 would be good.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.600]   And they immediately accommodate you being able to work when you work deeply and not
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   be interrupted.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.400]   That people are often surprised by the magnitude of changes that happen.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.120]   These cultures that you think are entrenched in your workplaces are often arbitrary, more
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.200]   malleable than you think if you have the right tool for dislodging them, which is something
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.880]   like this, a positive metric that's about optimizing value for the company and not about
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.240]   you just complaining about distraction.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.760]   Second idea, suggest structured check-ins.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.700]   Like, hey, I do a lot of copywriting, but there's often updates and stuff that happens.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.600]   There's a lot of interaction I need to do with you, boss.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   So here's what we should do.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.520]   We should have beginning of the day and at two o'clock these pre-scheduled real-time
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.240]   check-ins on the phone.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.960]   So Krishna works remotely, so it'd be on the phone or on Zoom or something.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   We always check in.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.040]   Here's what I'm working on today.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   What else do I need to know?
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.080]   Okay, great, let's check in back again at one-thirty or two.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.480]   Hey, what updates do you have for me?
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   Let's talk them through.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   Let me talk to you about what just happened.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.040]   And you can make the argument that these twice-a-day check-ins are going to very efficiently keep
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:47.880]   you coordinated and actually free the boss from the burden of having these ongoing back-and-forth
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.560]   email-based or Slack conversations that he or she has to keep track of and they're bouncing
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.800]   back and forth at random times.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.960]   Remember, from the point of view of the person talking to you, from the point of view of
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.680]   your boss, they probably dislike these drawn-out back-and-forth conversations as much as you
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.520]   do because they have to keep track of it.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   So it might be more attractive.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.320]   Like we have this very concentrated check-ins.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.840]   If I have issues, I know exactly when we're going to talk and that I can get you.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.000]   I don't have to just send it off in an email and just I don't know when the response is
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.080]   going to come.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.200]   So twice-a-day check-ins might be a solution for both parties here.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.320]   The third idea, and you can actually add this idea onto the first two.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.360]   This comes from my book, A World Without Email, add a safety valve.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:36.620]   So for almost any type of more structured communication process that you suggest, it's
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.620]   often useful if you think there's going to be some resistance from other people involved
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.240]   to put in what I call a safety valve, a way they can always reach you if they need to
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.320]   outside of the system's rules.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.200]   The key is to add enough friction to this that it's not something that you would easily
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   do.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.880]   For instance, here is my personal cell phone number.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.280]   Now, this is really critical.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.840]   I have it in do not disturb mode when I work.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.400]   So I don't see text messages, but calls come through.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:15.440]   So if, for example, there is something really urgent that comes up before our next scheduled
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.280]   check-in or when I'm in the middle of a deep work session, you can just call me on my personal
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   number.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.680]   The call will come through.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.200]   It's not impossible, right?
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.000]   So it destabilizes the fears, right?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.880]   So often it's fears of particular rare outcomes that prevent bosses from agreeing to new communication
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.880]   processes.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.960]   What if there's emergency X?
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.060]   It alleviates those fears.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.560]   If there was emergency X, I could call you, right?
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.140]   But it's high enough friction that they're not going to do it unless it's a true emergency.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.440]   If you let it be text messaging, too low friction.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.840]   Bosses will be like, "Let me just text you.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.920]   That's low friction.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.320]   There's no social capital costs for me.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.120]   I can just do it and move on with my day."
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.040]   But a call is high enough friction that it has to be sort of more of a legitimate emergency.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.960]   So the safety valve method works well because it's what finally helps convince like your
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.240]   boss or your team we can do this more structured communication because the worst case scenarios
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   can actually happen.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.280]   You can always just call me.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   But the friction is high enough that they basically won't.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.760]   So it's like a trick.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.880]   It's a trick to get the system you want.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.440]   Your boss is thinking like, "Oh, I can get them whenever I need to.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   It won't be a problem."
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.280]   But no one wants to call people.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.400]   And so you end up actually getting the system for the cost of like once a week you get a
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.400]   call.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   All right.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   So safety valves is the third thing to suggest.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   All right.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.960]   Who do we got next, Jesse?
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.240]   Next question is from Tian.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.640]   "I'm comfortable with my current job, but it's risky.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.760]   It's a startup and it might not make it.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.280]   Should I change jobs?"
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.840]   I would say don't change jobs now, right?
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:55.320]   Because actually the best way from a career evolution perspective to leave a startup to
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:01.120]   go to something else is actually the startup failing because that's not on you and it makes
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.120]   you very attractive.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.760]   You're like, "Oh, this is someone who has been in other startups and has had this role
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   before.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.720]   Yeah, most startups don't work, but now they're available.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   Let's grab them."
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:16.320]   So you actually have more, I think it looks better and you have more leverage in the technology
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:23.280]   startup world if you came out of a startup that didn't make it as opposed to, "I left
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.760]   a startup when it was still rock and rolling."
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.320]   Then people are like, "What's going on there?
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.800]   Were you not cutting it?"
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.160]   They're like, "We need to get someone better in here."
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.080]   So I would ride it out.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:40.600]   However, take advantage of the flexible or sort of building the plane while it's in the
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.800]   air nature of startups to max out your career capital acquisition while there.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.920]   So career capital, for those who don't know it, is a concept from my book, So Good They
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.200]   Can't Ignore You.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.760]   It is my term for your rare and valuable professional skills.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.120]   Career capital is your primary tool for crafting your working life towards things that resonate
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.520]   and away from things that don't.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.220]   Startups give you a lot of flexibility.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.180]   Don't squander that flexibility by being Captain Slack.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.040]   What I'm offering here is a jack of all trades.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.520]   I answer everyone's questions at all hours of the day, and it's all sort of small stuff,
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.160]   but I'm kind of like this useful glue that kind of helps everyone else do what they're
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   doing.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.100]   No, you want to be building up demonstrative skills.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:29.920]   Hey, why don't I take on our API architecture?
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.880]   Because that is a really valuable thing to know how to do, and I'm going to dive into
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.320]   that and know how to do that.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.640]   I'm not going to be bothered by a lot of it.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.840]   I'm doing the API architecture.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.000]   I'm going to learn how to do our digital marketing.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.600]   Why don't I take that up?
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:46.560]   So use the flexibility and autonomy of startups to build up skills you think are going to
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.440]   be very valuable with whatever comes next, because the more rare and valuable skills
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.680]   you have, the more control you're going to have about the nature of your work.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.920]   All right, Jesse, who do we got?
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.640]   Next question is from Brendan.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.160]   I'm a journalist working on my second book.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.000]   My days are largely time-blocked, and I do stuff like transcribing recordings, phone
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.800]   interviews, some in person, research, reading, and writing.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.240]   My problem is dealing with source phone calls.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.680]   How can I prevent unpredictable source phone calls from interrupting my focus on other
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   tasks?
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.560]   You know, I've heard this question before.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.880]   I have this issue a little bit as well.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.560]   Not so much incoming source phone calls, but for a lot of my journalism, I have to set
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.240]   up calls and interviews, right?
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.120]   And what happens, this is what this reporter, I believe, is talking about.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.660]   What happens is it becomes very disruptive, because your instinct when you're asking someone
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.400]   to call you or do an interview with you is to be as flexible as possible.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.040]   Hey, when can you do this next week?
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.440]   And just sort of everything that's not currently booked with a meeting or appointment is on
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.760]   the table.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.800]   But then you get this sort of scattershot of meetings and trips that eats up your time
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.600]   to consistently make deep work.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.840]   Like, I can't write every morning because three mornings out of five, I have a call
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.080]   this morning and I have to go see this source this morning.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.600]   The best thing you can do is have what I think of as like very granular ranges for when this
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.040]   type of stuff happens, both outgoing and ingoing.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:26.840]   So for example, you might say Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, any time in the afternoon is loosely
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.960]   left open for interviews and calls.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   You can tell sources, you're like, "Hey, yeah, just let me know.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.000]   In fact, I'm usually always around Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday afternoons.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.200]   You can just, here's my personal number.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   Call me."
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.360]   So you're kind of directing the incoming towards those periods.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.480]   And when you were scheduling meetings, outgoing meetings, "Hey, when can we talk about this?"
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.800]   Instead of just saying, "When are you free next week?"
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.040]   You say, "When are you free Tuesday through Thursday in the afternoon?"
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.520]   That's when I typically do this type of stuff.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.080]   This now constrains the sort of range, the territory within your schedule in which these
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.600]   type of disruptions happen, which means Monday and Friday, you can really go in an autonomous,
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.960]   undistracted way.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.920]   Every single morning, you can work in an undistracted way pretty predictably.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:21.160]   So it's not a super narrow range, like I do my calls from 3 to 3.43 on Thursdays.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.400]   And if you cannot do it then, then we will not talk.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.720]   If you get that restrictive, you're going to have no sources.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.680]   But if you're talking like half the week, half the days, you would be surprised, right?
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.320]   And sometimes maybe people have to go forward a couple of weeks for that work, but people
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   don't care.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.720]   In fact, people like having a little bit of constraints, right?
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:43.080]   What do we really dread worse from a cognitive effort standpoint than when you get that email
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.800]   from someone, you're like, "Yeah, we can talk."
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.480]   And they say, "When is good for you next week?"
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.080]   You're like, "I don't know."
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:54.440]   You're talking to like 40 or 50 possible available hours, like, "Do I just pick a couple?
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.360]   Do I give you every single hour that's free?"
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.240]   It's actually nice to have some constraints, like, "Which afternoons, Tuesday through Thursday,
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   when in that are you free?"
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.160]   And now you're like, "Oh, there's two times in there I'm free."
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.080]   You've made my job in answering your question easier.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.120]   So have those rough ranges.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   That helps.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:18.560]   I mean, I'll be doing something similar with my upcoming temporary administrative role.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   I will have these sort of rough ranges where I'm like, "This is when we set up.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.800]   Let's meet, pick a time.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   When in here works for you.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   This is when I normally meet.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.320]   You can call me any time during these periods if you have a question."
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.360]   I'm definitely gonna be trying something similar because I need every morning, I really want
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.440]   every morning, if I'm not teaching, I want every morning free for writing, and I want
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.760]   at least one day a week where like I'm gonna get that full day pretty autonomously working
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.760]   on stuff.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.040]   So I'll report back how that works, but that would be my suggestion.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.800]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.120]   - Next question's from Carolina.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.200]   "At the start of every month, I look forward to your review of the books you read.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.840]   I can't come close to reading five books per month, but I do enjoy reading.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.860]   My question is about reading difficult and long books.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.840]   How do you suggest I read those?
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.280]   What's the ideal ratio of reading difficult to easy books for someone in my shoes?"
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.520]   - Well, first of all, Carolina, I think you probably could read five books a month.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.600]   You know, again, the easiest thing to do here is stop using your phone so much.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.920]   Most people's phone usage is already right there, about five books a month worth of reading.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.740]   The second thing you can do is just integrate reading as a default activity to more parts
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.740]   of your day.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.680]   It's like what you do when you eat lunch, it's what you do at the end of the day.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.440]   I have a pretty busy schedule, but the books still sort of add up.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.760]   All right, but to get to your specific question, long books, we say hard books, I'm thinking
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   long books.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.360]   They can take a lot of time.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.440]   A couple things I would suggest is when it comes to difficult books, pick those that
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.780]   delight you.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.120]   If you make it a chore, it's gonna be very hard to get through.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.160]   So if you're reading a big book, it's because you're fascinated in what that book is about.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.300]   That will really help.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.200]   Big books, hard books, it's good to have a regular time for those.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:02.560]   I often do this where, you know, like I need to read a big book on like AI policy or like
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:10.320]   right now I'm reading for an intellectual biography of Thoreau, which useful context
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.540]   for the introduction of my new book, we're gonna be talking about Thoreau.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.400]   And like when I was on vacation, it was, that's just what I do first thing in the morning
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.960]   even before like my kids wake up is like get in a reading session of this book.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.040]   And it's like the slow and regular, like now you just do that.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.680]   And you got the slow and regular pace.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.720]   Combine the big books like shorter, funner stuff.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.480]   If you're just only reading the big book and you can't read anything else till it's done,
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.040]   its footprint is too big and you go too long without being able to read anything else.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.240]   And you encounter new books you hear about that seem fun or exciting.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.080]   You don't get to them because you're waiting for this big book to end and you're going
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.320]   to abandon the big book.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:49.160]   So just have that like steady time for reading the difficult book and be okay with it taking
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.440]   a very long time and then like still have like fun books you're reading outside of that.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.520]   And above all, don't sweat the timing.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.960]   I mean, unless you have a podcast where you actually have to report on your reading each
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.440]   month, no one's tracking it.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.800]   So what's important is that like you're constantly engaged in books you like.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.080]   Sometimes you make more progress than others, but that you're enjoying the time you're spending
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.760]   doing that intellectual activity as opposed to shallower intellectual activities like
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.520]   just looking at your phone.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.440]   So for that morning session where you read the Thoreau book, how long would, like half
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440]   an hour?
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   Yeah, like 20 minutes, half hour.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.440]   Yeah, stuff adds up.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:30.700]   So when I first got up there, I finally finished reading The Coming Wave, which is just like
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:36.880]   an AI book that everyone's reading, written by the co-founder of DeepMind.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.240]   And then I moved on to Thoreau book, yeah.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.560]   And I'll probably ramp it up a little bit, you know, it just depends on the day.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.720]   It'll take me a while to read, but I don't really care.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.200]   I want that background though, so I can talk with more confidence about Thoreau and just
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.480]   sort of finishing this whole book is going to give me, give me that confidence.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.400]   All right, let's see what we got here.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.760]   Oh, is it our next question, our slow productivity corner?
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   Yes.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.160]   All right, let's get some theme music.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:13.280]   So for those who are new, we have one question every week that is relevant to my new book,
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.160]   Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.520]   We call this a slow productivity corner.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.920]   If you haven't checked out that book, do so.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.120]   It's like the source Bible for 60% of what we talk about on this show.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.280]   So check out slow productivity if you haven't.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.200]   Okay, Jesse, what is our slow productivity corner question of the week?
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.840]   Hi, it's from Josh.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.560]   I just turned 30 and I'm getting worried.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.080]   I feel like my mind doesn't fully trust the slow productivity approach.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.920]   I feel like I've started too late and should have adopted these strategies five to 10 years
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   ago.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.640]   I still have high ambitions for my professional and creative life, but deep down I worry that
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.760]   I'm still not good enough and I'm too late.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.920]   Oh my, if 30 is too late, Jesse, we're in trouble.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.280]   Yeah, we're dinosaurs.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   We're old men.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   We're old men.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.800]   Look, you're not too late.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:05.120]   The way I think it's useful to think about career and your age is the decade approach.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:09.600]   You've got your 20s, you have your 30s, you have your 40s, you have your 50s, et cetera,
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   right?
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:16.240]   For most people, your 20s is just about getting on your feet, becoming an autonomous adult,
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.920]   having a job, holding down a job, saving a little money, having a place to live.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.280]   You buy your first car, right?
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.240]   It's just, hey, I want to, while still just like enjoying being an adult for the first
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:31.440]   time, your 30s really, especially in like a knowledge work context, right, where jobs
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:38.200]   are more fluid and the potential promotion ladders or advancement ladders are long and
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.280]   go far into the distance.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.120]   Your 30s then are about, okay, now I want to like figure out my professional life, figure
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.200]   out, make my, like this is where I want to live, this is where I want to do, I want to
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.280]   be able to support myself and support my family.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.520]   I want to be sort of like comfortable.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.080]   Like this is where I figure out what I want my life to actually be like.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.080]   So you're 30.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.600]   This is perfect.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.800]   Perfect time to start thinking about slow productivity.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.800]   New to it, in your young 30s, I'm going to highlight a couple of things to focus on right
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.560]   off the bat.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:14.920]   I would really start with actually principle three, obsess over quality.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.800]   This is the right time to change your mindset towards.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.920]   I'm going to figure out something that is really important in like what I do or what
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   I want to do.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:29.280]   And I'm going to master this like Jiro the Sushi Chef and Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.060]   Reference to those who know that movie.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:36.460]   Like now I'm going to start really caring about mastery because that obsession over
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.200]   mastery of something that is valuable, it could take one to three years so you really
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.360]   get the full rewards for that.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.840]   But that's perfect timing to start this in your 30s.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.440]   That's going to be the engine for everything else.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.920]   For one thing, as I talk about in my book, as you really obsess over mastery of something
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.560]   that's valuable, you're going to find more meaning in your work.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.160]   It's a key time to find more meaning in your work because if you don't, the excitement
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.440]   of just I have a job from your 20s has worn off and you might stumble towards a sort of
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   nihilistic existentialism.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.480]   So this is a good time to find meaning in your work.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   Two, it is going to make pseudo productivity, it's going to make this potentially sort of
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.680]   crippling addiction to activity for the sake of activity seem increasingly absurd.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.360]   So it's just going to change your mindset.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.760]   So a slower productivity approach is not going to be something you're convincing yourself
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.480]   to try and you're afraid of.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.120]   A slower productivity approach is instead going to become self-evident.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:39.240]   And three, as you get good at things in your early 30s, there's your career capital, there's
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.960]   your flexibility.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.800]   You are now in demand.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.820]   Your employer doesn't want to lose you, other employers want you.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.400]   Now you can start getting interesting as your 30s go on.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.480]   Where do I want to live?
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   Now I have choices.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.760]   I want to be in the countryside.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.120]   I want to be, you know what, I want to live up by like the White Mountains in New Hampshire
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.520]   and do my job remotely and do it at 75% time.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.880]   This is where if you've become excellent at what you do, people are like, okay, sure,
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.880]   that's what we'll do, right?
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.660]   Like this is where you gain your autonomy.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.320]   This is where you gain more options.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:16.560]   So obsess over quality right now is going to give you lots of advantages.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.560]   If I was going to point towards a second thing to do right now, I would say this is a great
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.320]   time to do lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.280]   If you haven't tried this exercise yet, figure out where for like, think of the second half
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   of your 30s.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.040]   Think of the right timeframe if you're 30 even right now.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.840]   What do you want your day-to-day life to be like in the second half of your 30s?
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.800]   All aspects of your life, like where you live, the rhythm of your day, who's around you,
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.520]   how you're spending your time, the general characteristic of your work as well as the
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.500]   general characteristic of your time outside of work.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:50.300]   If you have specific examples of real people that you've seen in magazine profiles or documentaries
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.040]   or videos that resonate, integrate them into this.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.340]   Get this really clear vision of your ideal lifestyle for the second half of your 30s.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.400]   This is the time to do it and start working backwards from that vision.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.720]   All right.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.640]   So what different things can I be moving towards now that's going to move me closer to aspects
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   of this vision?
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.800]   And that's when you start building up these interesting, nuanced, bespoke, evidence-based
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.480]   lifestyle plans.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.960]   This is a very different approach than what most people in our culture lean towards, which
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.120]   is working forward to a singular grand goal.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.320]   It's our instinct as Americans.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.040]   I have a singular grand goal.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.280]   If I do this, then my whole life will be better.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.360]   And it doesn't work out that way.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:33.680]   You're much better off having your ideal lifestyle in your 30s is the time to figure this out.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:39.120]   And then say, okay, how am I going to work towards the aspects of that lifestyle?
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.240]   That works hand-in-hand with the career capital you generate by obsessing over quality.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.800]   Works hand-in-hand with that, that you begin to have some pretty interesting options that
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.060]   maybe are very specific to your exact job and situation.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.620]   It's not some big thing, like I'm going to write a screenplay or I'm going to sell my
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.620]   novel.
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.260]   It's very specific and boring to the outside world.
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.620]   But for you, it's what allows you to transform these aspects of your life to really get closer
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.620]   to your ideal lifestyle.
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:06.000]   So your 30 is the perfect time to think about this.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.540]   But I'm glad you asked.
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.140]   If you haven't read it yet, though, definitely pick up Slow Productivity.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.080]   Also pick up So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.820]   That will also be really useful to you right now.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:23.860]   And with that, we'll leave it with some more theme music.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:32.300]   All right, now we have a case study.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.860]   This is where people write in to talk about them applying the type of advice we do here
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.300]   on the show to their specific life.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.180]   So we can see what do these ideas look like in practice.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:49.420]   This case study comes from Old Coder, who says, "I have two scenarios to share.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:56.140]   First, over the last few years, my job has been transitioning away from coding to management.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.420]   There are also changes in the leadership of the company, and I found myself disagreeing
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.600]   with many of the new directions.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:06.860]   I had a strong urge to resign and search for a perfect job that I would truly enjoy.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:12.180]   However, I resisted this temptation and decided to use the lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.180]   approach instead.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:19.100]   I reflected on my long career at this company and realized that I enjoyed coding more than
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.580]   management.
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.620]   I was able to interview for a couple other jobs within my company.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:29.020]   I was selected for one as a remote developer, no more managing the people, and hardly any
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.860]   direct communication with top tier management, much better work balance to address my priorities
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.940]   outside of work.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:41.100]   Second, ever since I started listening to your podcast, I have undergone many changes
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.240]   in how I look at and live my life.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.500]   Over the last 10 months, with discipline, I have learned and started progressing in
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.820]   playing the flute.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.380]   For the initial three to four months, there was almost no progress, but I kept at it.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:52:00.020]   While I'm far from being a musician, I'm also not as bad as I thought I could be.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.620]   This gives me a lot of confidence that I could put discipline efforts into a hard thing and
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.980]   keep doing it."
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:10.500]   All right, Old Coder, this is a great example of many ideas from the sort of deep life questions
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.980]   that we deal with often here on the show.
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.820]   I'm going to point out two things here for the audience.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:23.020]   Notice lifestyle-centric planning, working backwards from your ideal lifestyle, not forwards
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.300]   towards a singular grand goal, opens up these really interesting possibilities.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:31.740]   Now, I just talked about this in the question before this, and we're seeing an actual practical
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.380]   case study of these ideas in action here.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:39.460]   What most people would do in Old Coder situation, where they're like, "Ah, man, I don't like
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:45.140]   this job," right, "I'm in management, I don't like the upper-level management, I just don't
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.140]   like my job," they would try to do a grand singular goal.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:54.180]   Like, "Let me start from scratch and become, you know, a genre book writer."
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.500]   You have some grand plan for how you're going to change everything and make it better all
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.680]   at once.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:03.220]   What Old Coder did instead was lifestyle-centric planning, and when thinking about the professional
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:10.780]   aspects of their life, he didn't fixate on specific jobs, but on the characteristics
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.500]   of the work life.
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:18.500]   And what he realized was, "I'm solitary, kind of introverted, I do like coding, I don't
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.500]   really like managing people, and there's a lot of friction when I have to deal with other
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.020]   like top-tier management people.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.260]   I get really caught up on their ideas, whether they're good or not, but I don't actually
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.540]   have much control over them because they're a higher level.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.900]   So really, for me, more ideal work would be something where it's much more solitary and
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:39.200]   it's much more sort of focused, intellectually demanding, and sort of flexibility about how
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.300]   you do that work."
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.420]   Once he realized that, he's like, "Looking at my options, I see, 'Oh, here's a great
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.380]   option to move closer to that lifestyle,' I change my job away from management towards
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.900]   this remote developer position, I see it's available.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.420]   This might be less money.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.820]   It's probably less prestigious."
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.220]   So it's not what shows up when you take the grand goal methodology of like, "Well, what's
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.620]   something cooler or impressive I can go after?"
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:05.220]   But it comes up blaring with neon lights around it when you take the lifestyle-centric approach.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:10.100]   The other cool thing I want to point out here, which comes up in almost every discussion
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:15.860]   of the deep life, is that discipline, by which we just mean the ability to consistently work
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:22.620]   on hard things, things that are hard in the moment, but that deliver important results
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.320]   down the line.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.320]   That type of discipline is to fuel for everything else.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.160]   Everything that goes into transforming your life requires as an input to the system that
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.080]   type of discipline.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.420]   It's thing after thing that are kind of hard in the moment, less exciting than your phone,
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:42.080]   but you need to do long-term to move towards a deep life.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.180]   What we see here is you get better at discipline if you practice it.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.560]   What a cool example.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.520]   He began playing the flute, and by doing so was like, "Oh, I can learn hard things."
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.440]   Ten months later, I'm pretty excited where I was, even though in month one, every session
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.600]   was hard, I could see no results.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.280]   He is absolutely right that that translates over.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:06.980]   That translates over to your general sense of what psychologists would call efficacy,
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.400]   your ability to pursue hard things and accomplish them.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.840]   This is like a fantastic case study of ideas of our practical approach to the deep life
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.640]   in action.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.860]   For those who are wondering how do I know it's a he, it's because we have parts of this.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.040]   We have correspondence to go along with these case studies and questions often that we don't
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.040]   read on the air.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:28.000]   I'm not making assumptions, actually, it is a he.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Let's see here.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Now, Jesse, do we have a call or are we going right to the function?
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   >> Yeah, we do.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   >> All right.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Let's hear it.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   >> Okay.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   >> Hi, Cal.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.540]   My name is Justine from Australia, and I'm about to start a new role in a new team, but
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:49.200]   in the same company, so doing a similar role as a senior data analytics lead.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:56.440]   I'm moving from a team that is quite structured and follows an agile ways of working with
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:02.660]   quarterly planning, two-week sprint planning, and everything's quite methodical in how the
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.900]   work that we do is planned out.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:10.620]   So I'm moving into a new team that I've heard is reactive, it's frazzled, doesn't have a
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.540]   structured way of planning future work.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:19.460]   So what advice would you give to someone in my position who wants to find the right balance
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:25.300]   between being seen as a strong performer in the new role who delivers high-quality work
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:33.060]   within the required time frames without allowing myself to get sucked into the stressed out,
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:40.260]   reactive, frazzled, last-minute rush hive mind that I've heard the new team can be like
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:46.580]   just due to the lack of overall structure in how they plan their work.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.860]   Any advice is much appreciated.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:48.860]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.320]   >> All right, Justine, I like this question.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:56.940]   This is also sort of a stealth, slow productivity corner question because the ideas here come
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.180]   straight from my book.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:04.420]   The key thing I want you to think about here is that there's two different factors at play.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.740]   There's you wanting to produce really high-quality work that you're known for, and then there's
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:19.140]   separately from that not being socially difficult in terms of your responsiveness.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.220]   These are two unrelated things.
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:27.340]   You being super responsive and really leaning into the hyperactive hive mind frazzled workflow
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:34.300]   of this team, that might be important from a I don't want to be annoying or difficult
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.800]   to them perspective, unrelated to whether or not you get known as a top performer that
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.300]   produces really good work.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.340]   So first of all, let's keep that in mind.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:45.620]   As time goes on and you're able to produce really good stuff when you said you're going
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:51.020]   to do it, you're going to gain more and more idiosyncrasy credits in terms of how you structure
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.020]   and approach your work.
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.180]   So these are two separate things.
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:58.860]   So what you do in the meantime to walk this balance between I don't want to be fully frazzled
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:02.460]   in the hyperactive hive mind, but I also don't want to be super obnoxious.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.180]   This is a social issue, not a productivity issue.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.220]   What you can do is a ramp it up over time.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:13.280]   So again, as you produce more, as you finish more and more stuff, that's great.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:22.820]   You get more leeway in how you interact to, and I think this is super detailed in especially
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.580]   principle one and slow productivity.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:30.540]   But two, you can move a lot of this structure that your team adopted in your last team.
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.460]   You can move it onto yourself.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:39.180]   And again, I have a whole big long book chapter about this, so I won't get too detailed now,
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.380]   but there are ways to move a lot of this structure from the team to the individual so you can
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.060]   gain some of its benefits.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:52.060]   So this is where you get things like, for example, your own work tracking cue.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:56.280]   You're kind of simulating a Kanban board of waiting for working on done within just your
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.700]   own life and you make it transparent for everyone else.
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:02.900]   Well, my WIP, my works in progress limit here, I work on two things at a time and here they
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.540]   are and here's the other things you guys have brought up and here's where they are and you
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:09.740]   can see their order and I'll tell you when I pull them over there and it's transparent
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.880]   and you can see it so you know what I'm doing.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.060]   You can really push a lot of office hours, structure communication, lots of just again
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:22.540]   and again you're deflecting like, "Next time you're free, these hours, I'm always here.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:23.540]   Grab me.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.540]   We'll talk this through."
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:27.140]   Completely deflecting again and again ongoing conversations.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:32.180]   You have meeting planning software where you have a bunch of little short blocks, Tuesday,
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.180]   Wednesday, Thursday afternoons.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.580]   You're like, "And if you need to grab me just individually, boom, grab any time on here
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.180]   that works, whatever works for your schedule."
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:43.500]   So you're just again and again deflecting them away from just, "Can't we just go back
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.380]   and forth now because in the moment it's easy for me to say, to send this email, then it's
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.900]   off my plate, obligation, hot potato, you're it."
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:54.440]   You again deflect these type of back and forth the real time.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.060]   This is not necessarily a bad thing from their perspective.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.640]   People just want clarity like, "Okay, whatever.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.220]   The thing is I'm stressed because I have this question about this thing we're working on.
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.540]   And if I send you an email, it's off my plate and that's great until it comes back to me,
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:07.540]   then it's on my plate again.
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.900]   Then I'll send you another email and it's off my plate and I'll be happy again.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.900]   That's fine."
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.260]   Or if they get back from you like, "Talk to me at three."
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.760]   Or here's a link and click a time and then it's on your calendar.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.520]   You've solved the same problem.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.180]   They no longer have to keep track of this thing.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:22.460]   There's a next step that's scheduled out there.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.640]   So you could be structured about how you organize what you're working on and have a work in
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:30.240]   progress limit that's constrained and just be super transparent about this with everyone
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.240]   else.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.280]   You can deflect more back and forth asynchronous conversations to more structured real time
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.800]   sessions.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.000]   You can just do that even if your team doesn't like it.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.040]   If you're careful about it, they'll be annoyed, but it won't be insufferably annoyed.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.600]   And as you deliver again and again, then they'll just be like, "Justine's super organized.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   It's really impressive.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   She gets stuff done.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.880]   She has these cool systems.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880]   How did that work?
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.920]   What's this work in progress cue?
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920]   Tell me about that again."
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.320]   They'll be kind of impressed by it.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   The key is you do have to produce, but you can put some structure on yourself in the
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   meantime.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   All right.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.040]   So we have a final segment coming up, but first take a quick break to talk about another
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.400]   sponsor.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.640]   Look, if you need to hire, you need Indeed.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.440]   Indeed is your matching and hiring platform with over 350 million global monthly visitors
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:30.240]   according to Indeed data and a matching engine that helps you find quality candidates fast.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.880]   Ditch the busy work, use Indeed for scheduling, screening, and messaging so you can connect
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.960]   with candidates faster.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.160]   And Indeed doesn't just help you hire faster.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.680]   93% of employers agree that Indeed delivers the highest quality matches compared to other
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.920]   job sites according to recent Indeed surveys.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.120]   All right, look, here's the thing.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.160]   We talk all the time on here.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.400]   We just did a question about this, about like your teams working together, your teams being
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.720]   able to have good ways of structuring their work and communication.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.120]   For this to work, you got to have good people.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.920]   You got to have the right people who match the vibe of what you're doing and have the
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   right experience.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.200]   Having the wrong teammates really makes things hard, as we just talked about in the call.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.280]   Indeed will help you find the right people.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.760]   Look, they leverage over 140 million qualifications and preferences every day.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.240]   So their matching engine is constantly learning from your preferences.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.120]   So the more you use Indeed, the better it gets at finding you the right matches.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.720]   Over 3.5 million businesses worldwide use Indeed to hire great talent fast.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.120]   You should join them.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.800]   So here's the good news.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:44.560]   Listeners of the show will get a $75 sponsored job credit to get your jobs more visibility
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.480]   if you go to indeed.com/deep.

[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:01.200]   on this podcast, indeed.com/deep, terms and conditions apply.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.520]   Need to hire.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520]   You need Indeed.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:09.120]   I also want to talk about our longtime friends at Shopify.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.680]   Whether you're selling a little or a lot, Shopify helps you do your thing however you
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680]   cha-ching.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.720]   Look, Shopify is the global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   business.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.680]   We're talking from the launch your online shop stage to the first real life store stage
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.280]   all the way to the, did we just hit a million order stage?
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.960]   Shopify is there to help you grow.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:41.000]   Whether you're selling scented soap or offering outdoor outfits like the deer outfit we talked
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.320]   about last week on the show that I like to walk around my vacation home in to upset the
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   owner.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.640]   Whatever it is that you're selling, you need Shopify.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.560]   They help you sell everywhere from their all-in-one e-commerce platform to their in-person point
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.640]   of sale system, wherever and whatever you're selling, Shopify's got you covered.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.040]   Shopify helps you turn browsers into buyers with the internet's best converting checkout
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.320]   36% better on average compared to other leading commerce platforms.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:17.480]   You can also sell more with less effort thanks to Shopify's magic AI powered all-star.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.400]   We don't yet have an online shop here at Deep Questions, but we know when we do, Shopify
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.400]   is what we're going to use.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.000]   In fact, Jesse, we have a Shopify account kind of waiting to go.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.340]   We were messing around with it before.
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.340]   Yes, we were.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.560]   Yeah, so we are good to go with Shopify.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:38.560]   All we're missing is something to sell that's not going to terrify or horrify people countrywide.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.200]   Lots of big companies use Shopify.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:46.240]   It powers over 10% of all e-commerce and has award-winning help to help you at every stage
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.400]   because businesses that grow, grow with Shopify.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:54.680]   So sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep, but you got to type that
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:01.180]   all lowercase letters, that's shopify.com/deep to grow your business no matter what stage
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.180]   you're in.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.180]   Shopify.com/deep.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:08.920]   All right, Jesse, we're now moving on to our final segment.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   Okay.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   So we've got two, I just had two sort of fun sightings of the book, Deep Work in Unexpected
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   Places.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.120]   I'm going to bring something up on the screen here.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.040]   So if you're watching instead of listening, you can see what we're talking about.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.680]   All right, first let's talk about, you know, the New York Times just released their list
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.400]   of the 100 best books of the 21st century.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:39.160]   Now the way that they generated this list is they sent out surveys to about a thousand
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.040]   notable people from the world of books and asked them for their 10 best books.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.600]   What do you think the 10 best books are of the 21st century?
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:52.600]   And then they aggregated those votes and did a little magic and got their list of 100.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.760]   They put up here, and I have this on the screen now, a list of some of these ballots.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:01.880]   So some of the people they asked, give us your 10 best books of the 21st century, said,
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.200]   yeah, you can put my ballot on here, right?
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:10.160]   So this list that they have here, they have the ballots of Stephen King, Minjin Lee, you
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160]   have R.L.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   Stein, Junot Diaz, Sarah Jessica Parker, Stephanie Graham Jones, Annette Gordon-Reed, et cetera.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.160]   All right.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:23.600]   So this is a bunch of people, known literary figures saying, here's my thoughts of the
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.280]   10 best books of the 21st century.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.600]   Here's where we get involved.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.840]   One of the people that they asked and who allowed them to put their ballot live was
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.200]   our good friend Ryan Holiday.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.120]   So let me just click on Ryan Holiday here.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.520]   Here is his ballot of the 10 best books.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.160]   And what do we see?
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.800]   Deep work is in that list.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:48.880]   So he gave 12 books, his opinion for the 12 best books of the 21st century.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.440]   So I think we have to figure out how to state this carefully, Jesse.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:07:01.160]   But maybe we can say officially nominated as one of the 10 best books of the 21st century.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.960]   There was somewhere around 5,000 books that were mentioned.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.240]   But I mean, technically, maybe that's true.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.240]   Officially nominated.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:13.280]   Or we just be like, potentially one of the 10 best books of the 21st century and attribute
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.560]   that to the New York Times.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.360]   So the problem is, they do give the vote totals on here if more than one person chose it.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.360]   So we see in Ryan's choices, he had like Cormac McCarthy's The Road.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.920]   And there's an emblem that says 13 people picked that as one of the 10 best books of
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920]   the 21st century.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.400]   So deep work, he was the only one to actually suggest that.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.920]   But I think it counts, Jesse.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.920]   It does.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.960]   At least in the opinion of some, it is one of the best books of the 21st century.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.800]   All right, we have another sighting here I'm going to load up of deep work.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800]   Listener sent this in.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.800]   Pretty cool.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.640]   It is a license plate.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.760]   Here's a picture of his California license plate, vanity license plate.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.880]   And his license plate is deep work.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.400]   Missing the O. But anyways, he sent that to us.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.440]   So there we go.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:05.200]   Our super fan in California has a deep work license plate.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.240]   If you see his car on the road, because it has a distinctive license plate.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:15.040]   If you see his car on the road and you see the driver looking at his phone, you need
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.040]   to ram his car off the road.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040]   Good.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.600]   Hit it in the back corner so it spins out and roll.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.560]   Because, you know, you got it.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.960]   He's representing deep work.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.800]   Actually, what I want to see is you see this car on the road.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.440]   You know, he's on the 405, 80 miles per hour.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.600]   What I want to see is that driver is reading a thick book while he drives.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.880]   Because he has a Tesla so I can self drive.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.080]   That's what I want to see.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   It's a Tesla.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   Is that what it is?
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   Oh, that'd be fantastic.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.080]   There's another picture in there.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.080]   You can see it.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.080]   All right.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.080]   Let's see.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.080]   Where do I go?
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080]   Just in the note in the.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.080]   It's another post.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080]   Oh, it's another post.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.080]   OK.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.080]   I didn't realize.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.080]   Oh, there it is.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.080]   Oh, it's on a Tesla.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   Oh, man.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.400]   I want to see a picture of a video.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.720]   I want to be a video.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.840]   You're pulling up behind the Deep Work Tesla.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   Right.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   And then you pull off to this.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.420]   You kind of come up to its side and you panned the camera over.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.960]   And what you see is the driver just with, you know, a thick Thoreau biography with reading
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.160]   glasses on, just reading in the driver's seat while the Tesla drives.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.800]   I feel like our lawyers have to get involved and say disregard everything that Cal just
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.800]   said.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   Be fantastic.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   There we go.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.380]   So Deep Work is making its impact.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:29.260]   I thought those were both both fun to see.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.260]   One other quick note.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.000]   We have a fan, Zach, who's sending us some VBLCCP hats.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   Oh, he made them.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   Oh, fantastic.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Fantastic.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   All right.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   I'm excited.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   I will wear it.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   I will wear my VBLCCP hat.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   It should be in the mail soon.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.280]   I will wear it on air when we get it.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.880]   I need a new hat.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.120]   My Nationals hat got too beat up.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.720]   I had to buy a different hat when I was up north.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.000]   But I remember thinking, I wish I just had my own hat.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.340]   I was like, I should just design my own hat.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.160]   Like why go buy about some Patagonia hat in a outfitter so I had something to wear while
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160]   we hiked.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   I was like, why not just have my own hat?
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.840]   So, OK, I'm excited about this VBLCCP.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.680]   That's how we'll know who the true fans are, Jesse, if they recognize the hat.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.160]   That probably fits on a license plate, too.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.740]   All right, everyone.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.040]   Well, anyways, thanks for listening.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:22.400]   We'll be back next week with another normal in-person, in-studio episode of the podcast.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400]   But thanks for listening.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.720]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:30.520]   Hey, if you like today's discussion about finding focus during distracting times, I
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:35.360]   think you'll also like Episode 307, where we talk about ultra-processed content and
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.720]   improving the quality of what you consume online.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.720]   Check it out.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.760]   So today, I want to talk about digital distraction.
