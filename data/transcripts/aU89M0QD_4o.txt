[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   I mean, I suppose there are a few songwriters, poets, and I've got some friends in those
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.960]   domains of life, and they do seem to derive a lot of insight and inspiration and have
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:20.000]   done amazing things through the kind of depths of unhappy human emotion.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.800]   We can get back to that later because I do think there's something about them that's
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800]   kind of intriguing.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.600]   The depth of unhappy human emotion, we can get back to that later because I do think
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.640]   there's something about the contrast of moving from these more painful emotions to happiness
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.960]   that's very different than moving from a state of immense happiness to slightly less, but
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.880]   we can get back to that.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.280]   But most people would like to be happy as much as possible.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.000]   I certainly would.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.480]   Who wouldn't?
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.880]   And one, of course, can ask, "Well, should I work on my feelings?
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.800]   Should I think about my feelings, try and shift my feelings, let my feelings move through
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.520]   me in a cathartic way?
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.920]   Should I work on the thought patterns?
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920]   Should I work on the behaviors?"
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.720]   I'm a big believer from my own experience that behaviors are powerful in setting the
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.160]   general trajectory of thought patterns and feelings, but I've also experienced it going
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.580]   the other way too.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.760]   So what does the research say about this, and what can we do because everyone wants
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.760]   to be happier?
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   That's another thing you're not supposed to do.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.360]   You don't have to change your circumstances.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.000]   And that's great because, like, quintupling your income is tricky, you know, moving is
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.080]   tricky, you know, switching your life around all over the place is hard, right?
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.360]   And the good news is the science shows you don't have to do that.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.200]   That doesn't work as well as you think.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.760]   But you can hack your behaviors and your thought patterns and your feelings to get some good
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   results, right?
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.600]   Let's take behaviors, right?
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.680]   One of the biggest behavioral changes you can make to feel happier is just to get a
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.160]   little bit more social connection.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.040]   Like, psychologists do these fun studies where they look at people's, like, daily usage patterns.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.960]   So how much time are you spending sleeping or exercising or at work or whatever?
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.640]   And the two things that predict whether or not you're happy or not so happy is how much
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.160]   time you spend with friends and family members and how much time you're just physically around
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   other people.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.340]   Like, the more of that you do, the happier you're going to be.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.920]   And you know, that's just a correlation, right?
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.440]   So your savvy listeners are thinking right now, like, well, is it hanging around with
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.240]   other people causes you to be happier or do you tend to, like, hang out with other people
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   more if you are happy?
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.720]   Like, which direction does the causal arrow go?
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.400]   And here we have these lovely studies by psychologists who do these kind of funny experiments where
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.160]   they offer people, like, a $10 Starbucks gift card to just talk to somebody, usually talk
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.360]   to a stranger, like, that they don't know on the train.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.760]   Some lovely work by Nick Epley and others have done this, because you force people to
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.940]   get social.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.640]   And what people predict, especially with strangers, is like, ooh, that's going to feel awkward
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.280]   and kind of weird.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.120]   But what you find across the board, and this includes an introvert and extroverts, is that
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.800]   talking to somebody actually feels good.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.040]   It increases your positive emotion.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   It gives you a sense that your life is going better.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.540]   You feel less lonely.
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.040]   It just has these positive outcomes that we don't expect.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.280]   I love social connection.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.320]   The problem I have with social connection is that if I drop in with somebody for, you
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.480]   know, 30 minutes or a couple of hours, when that's done, I usually have so much that I
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.600]   need to tend to that I end up staying up later than I need to in order to complete that,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.680]   diminishing my sleep.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.880]   And then I feel like there's an underlying kind of like sinking ship sense to my physiology,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.800]   and then I have to recover my sleep.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.280]   So, you know, everything's a trade-off.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.600]   What's interesting about the study you just mentioned is that it's just a brief coffee,
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   presumably.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.500]   So maybe one doesn't need to spend quite as much time with people.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.520]   But I think, you know, I think, like, even years ago, actually, he's dead now.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.880]   But there was a â€“ I guess it's okay to say even though he's dead.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.160]   He was a somewhat eccentric professor at UC Berkeley.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280]   I took a class from him when I was a graduate student there named Seth Roberts.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.640]   He's known for some kind of bizarre theories about eating and if people want to look this
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.960]   up, I mean, like, really kind of different stuff.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.360]   But I applaud his bravery and just, you know, being out there.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.160]   But he was an eccentric guy, and he told us in this class when I was there that it was
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.260]   very important to see faces at least once a day, real faces, not on a screen.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.800]   This was before social media.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.880]   And that it was important at some point to leave your apartment and, like, see the barista
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.640]   and say hello and thank you and see people on the street.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.360]   And now knowing what we know about these dedicated areas of the brain, like the fusiform face
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.960]   gyrus and Nancy Kanwisher's work and about these brain areas, like, we are hardwired
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.680]   for seeing faces and recognizing faces.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.580]   Now, that alone doesn't mean that seeing faces is a requirement for being happy on
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.380]   a consistent basis.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.160]   But I think they were onto something.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.240]   I think Seth was onto something, even though he had some also just, like, completely crazy
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.240]   ideas.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240]   This idea doesn't seem crazy.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   This has been my experience.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.960]   Even though I spent a lot of time alone, if I go a few days without seeing a face, something
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   happens inside that shifts the way my internal kind of set point for well-being.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.520]   And then you see somebody and it's, like, delightful, even if it's just a hello kind
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   of thing.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.520]   I mean, I think the reason why social connection matters so much is it's building off this
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.520]   basic neural circuitry, right, for seeing faces and so on.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.160]   And I think that gives us real insight into the kinds of social connections that work
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.000]   best, right, which has been characterized in the field as sort of in real time social
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.680]   connection, right, which we're kind of moving away from.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.000]   So what do I mean by in real time?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You know, you and I are sitting in a studio right now chatting, and we're kind of chatting
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   in real time.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I can see your face.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We're live.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.800]   But we might have been able to do this, like, over some sort of video chat.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.280]   It wouldn't be as good, you know, but it's pretty good.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.640]   And the reason it seems to be pretty good is we're doing it in real time, right.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.240]   Our auditory system, our visual system, all these systems that are used to, as primates,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.720]   processing things with other folks around you, it works reasonably well.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.000]   What doesn't work so well is how we often communicate, which is, like, over Slack, over
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   text.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I text you.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Vroom!
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   A few minutes later.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Vroom!
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It comes back.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.520]   Like, our primate brain's just, like, that's just not the way communication is set to work.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.040]   And so I think sometimes when I bring up social connection, people think, like, oh, I've got
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.440]   to see people in person, and my friend's going to live far away, and I'm, like, at work all
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440]   day.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.680]   You can connect, not necessarily live and in person, but as much as possible, try to
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680]   do it in real time.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.120]   And I think that's in part, and if possible, try to do it with video, I think, for the
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.480]   reason that you were just talking about, is that faces activate us.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.400]   But, you know, we're primates that are also really good at language and paying attention
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   to the voice.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.720]   I think it's one of the reasons that, like, an old-school phone conversation, no video
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.900]   chat with your friend, can be some of the most emotional connective conversation, sometimes
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.300]   better than in person, because when we're in person, we're pulling out our phones and
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.160]   checking and paying attention to other stuff.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.800]   But we've got to get back towards in real time.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.520]   The other stuff just doesn't have the same psychological oomph.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:03.880]   Is there any evidence that texting actually drives more of a desire for more social connection
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   and thus leaves us feeling less well than prior to a text exchange?
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.220]   Because I realize it's very hard to separate out the variables about what's the nature
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.880]   of the text exchange, how often do you see this person in real life, et cetera.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   But I could imagine that texting, the whoop, I don't do the sound effect as well as you
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   do.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.060]   I like that.
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.680]   But that texting could be the equivalent of getting crumbs of nourishment, not full nourishment.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.560]   I could also imagine that it's like putting nourishment just out of reach.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.580]   And I'm asking this really at a neurological level.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.580]   Do we know?
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.160]   Is the reward circuitry that's triggered by in real life social connection triggered but
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.520]   to a lesser degree by text exchange or by Zoom exchange?
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.560]   This would be an important study to do, I think.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   There's a lot of evidence for it.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.960]   But my intuition is that the way it works is almost like texting is sort of the NutriSuite
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.960]   of social connection.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.080]   I was feeling this motivation for social connection, and I did it, and I got something that was
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   sort of social.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   I got some information.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.720]   But psychologically, I'm missing the nutritious part of it.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.940]   So it kind of fakes you out into thinking that it's social connection, but it kind of
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.320]   doesn't really work.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.660]   And I worry that that's what we're all getting a lot of right now.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.400]   It's just so much easier to participate in the NutriSuite version of social connection
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.840]   because as political scientists and sociologists and others have pointed out, it's harder to
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.240]   meet with people in real life.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.800]   We don't have these so-called third spaces where we can get together easily anymore, right?
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.560]   There's so many draws of just being on your screen, being alone inside.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.820]   I think we're kind of missing out.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.760]   And so a lot of us are kind of starving nutritionally when it comes to social connection because
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.600]   we're going for the wrong stuff.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.360]   So schedule some, if possible, in real life time with somebody.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   Or in real time, right?
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.540]   You know, call that friend that you haven't talked to.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.100]   And recognize, because this is clear from the psychological research, that your brain
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.340]   is not telling you to do that.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.020]   Probably even when you're listening right now, you're like, "Yeah, I guess that would
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.020]   be helpful for me."
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.740]   But you're not kind of having a craving to talk to your friend.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.020]   And I think this is the problem with a lot of the behaviors that map onto happiness is
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.380]   that if you think of the evolutionary pressures for those behaviors, natural selection never
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.860]   had to build in, like, the goal of feeling social, because we were just like in these
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.860]   small bands.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.860]   It was really easy, right?
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.260]   Natural selection had to build in a kind of craving for sweet, fatty food because those
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.260]   were hard to find.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.060]   It didn't have to build in the craving for, like, you know, a bunch of greens because
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.060]   they were everywhere.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.260]   I think the same thing is true with social connection.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.180]   We just don't have a strong motivation to seek people out because it was just kind of
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.180]   there.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.260]   And I think our motivation and our reward systems don't cause us to kind of crave it.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.820]   But in the modern day where there's so many substitutes and we're kind of more isolated,
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.140]   I think many of us are kind of experiencing the negative effects of loneliness.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.260]   But then when we think, "Well, what could I do to get out of it?"
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.540]   There's not this, like, "I'm starving for connection."
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.660]   We don't have this sort of motivational goal to go out and get it.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.700]   And so what that can lead to is people making the prediction in their head of, like, you
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.740]   know, "I just heard Laurie say that this is a good idea, but, like, I don't know, probably
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.060]   not for me or maybe not as important."
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.940]   I think we just don't have systems that tell us to go out and get this stuff.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.100]   So even if your brain is saying, "That's not that important," try it.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.060]   Do your own personal experiment and get a little bit more in real time social connection
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.740]   and just take a moment to notice immediately after how it made you feel.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.780]   And I bet it'll be like, you know, all the kind of fitness hacks and nutrition hacks
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.540]   that you talk about on the show where you're like, "Oh my God, that made me feel so much
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.160]   better than I really expected it to."
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.140]   If seeing faces, and I don't have evidence for this, but if Seth Roberts was right and
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:44.380]   what we're talking about here is clearly based on existing data, if seeing faces somehow
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:50.080]   triggers the reward system in a healthy way that reinforces the social connection thing,
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.540]   if it, like, fills the vessel that, like, we're connected because we no longer live
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:00.460]   in small village and tribe type formats, most of us don't anyway, that if we plop down onto
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.420]   the couch and kind of, like, assume the classic C-shaped position of somebody who's about
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.580]   to go on their phone and you can scroll and see faces, you talked about that as a bit
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.620]   of, like, an artificial sweetener giving the illusion of some sort of nourishment, and
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.620]   then, you know, you see some stuff, you respond to stuff, you can see someone kind of dunk
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.060]   on somebody, maybe hear a joke, maybe make a joke, and then go into your DMs and, like,
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.060]   read a few, check a few.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.580]   And then you basically got no real social connection.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.580]   Correct.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.380]   You didn't have to move to do it.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.460]   And in a lot of ways, this has parallels to the ease of highly processed foods or something
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.460]   like that.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.900]   And I think we're starting to understand this a bit through Jonathan Haidt's work and other
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:52.340]   people's work, including your own, but I don't know that it's anything but really dangerous
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.340]   and bad.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:12:00.740]   I don't wanna sound alarmist, but I am really concerned that certainly for the younger generation,
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.900]   that if we don't have an intrinsic drive to go do something...
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900]   We stop doing it.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.140]   We stop doing it.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:12.780]   And then the brain is pretty plastic throughout the entire life, especially for these low-grade,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.260]   like many times repeated behaviors.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.620]   I mean, we can just slowly, you know, it's like there's drift.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.700]   And then we wonder why we don't feel so good.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.380]   I mean, you know how the dopamine system works, right?
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.140]   Like it has these mechanisms to crave stuff that's quick, quick hits, right?
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.140]   Our instant...
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.820]   You know, when we go on Reddit or go on Instagram and scroll through a feed, we're getting these
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.820]   kind of quick hits.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.020]   And another thing that is rewarding is new information.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.140]   You know, your Stanford colleague, Jamil Zaki, has done these lovely neuroscience studies
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.460]   that just finding out some interesting social information feels rewarding.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.380]   And kind of for the first time, we've been able to separate the reward value that comes
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.200]   from interacting with live human people and faces and social rewarding information that
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.500]   comes at us quickly at this dopamine hit that we crave a lot, but we don't have the craving
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.380]   mechanisms for the in real life connection.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.420]   And yeah, I think that's causing a lot of problems.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.820]   And it means we're kind of building more tools to do just that.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.740]   I had the musician David Byrne on my podcast.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.740]   Talking heads.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.740]   Talking heads, David Byrne.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.740]   Cool.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.740]   Who cares a lot about these issues.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.540]   He wrote a really cool article called Eliminating the Human, where he made the claim that pretty
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:29.420]   much every technological invention of the last 20 years has been, you know, dealing
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.020]   with actual people is kind of friction-y.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.780]   So let's just get rid of them, right?
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.460]   We'll, you know, have Uber or Lyft or a car company where I don't have to talk to the
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.460]   driver.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.460]   I just plug it into the phone.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.580]   We don't have to have a conversation.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.580]   We go away.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.580]   Right?
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.580]   We have music and streaming mechanisms.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.580]   I don't know.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.620]   Andrew, you're like my age, so you probably remember that you used to have to go into
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:54.300]   a record store to flip through CDs or tapes even if you're really old school to figure
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   out music.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.740]   And often when you do that, you'd run into humans or talk to the cashier guy or somebody
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.820]   would see you flicking through like, "Oh, you like talking heads?
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.140]   I like talking heads."
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.580]   Now we just go to an algorithm, right, from food delivery apps to kind of education, right?
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.980]   I have an online course where students don't have to sit in a real classroom with other
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.980]   students.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.260]   They could watch it directly.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.020]   So many of our technological innovations are assuming that what we want to get rid of is
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.020]   the friction part.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.620]   That's what we're kind of motivated to get rid of.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.700]   But ultimately, we're getting rid of the human in these interactions and our primate brains
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.180]   are left with the little NutriSuite dribbles of connection when what we really need is
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.580]   something in real life and in real time.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:38.900]   [music]
