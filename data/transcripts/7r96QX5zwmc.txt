[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Brian writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I was very encouraged by your message at the Legacy Conference on 2 Corinthians 4, 16-18.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   My question is about light momentary affliction. Does this affliction include my own sinfulness or only the sins done against me?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   The sin in my life that tears me down and hurts others, is that affliction that is preparing for me an eternal weight of glory?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Also, what about less noble things, like my team losing a football game?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   If my heart feels sad that we lost, is that an affliction that is producing for me an eternal weight of glory?"
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   You know, I have to say, Tony, at the beginning of this question, I am so thankful I get to do this.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Because that's a real question.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I mean, it may make us laugh at first that somebody would ask about the loss of a ball game and the affliction that works in eternal way.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   But that's exactly where we live. That's exactly the kind of question that people have.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And I'm nothing, I just love that question, frankly.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So let me try to tackle it in two halves.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   First, the sin question, and then the loss of the ball game.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Do my sins and their consequences become a part of the affliction that works an eternal weight of glory for me, according to 2 Corinthians?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Three observations. Number one, God may use our sins to bring us to the end of ourselves and make us despair of anything but Him.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Just like in 2 Corinthians 1.8, it's not talking about Paul's sin, but it's the way God works.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   We were so burdened beyond strength. We despaired of life itself.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We felt we had received the sentence of death.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   That was to make us rely on, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So afflictions work glory for us by knocking props out from under us and making us fall on God alone.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And I'm saying, yes, our sin can bring us to the end of ourselves.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   God, in His mercy, can make our sin stink to high heaven to us so that we cry out, "I'm hopeless! I'm hopeless!
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Oh God, if there's any grace!" And we throw ourselves on the mercy of God.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So sin can bring us to the point where we will inherit a weight of glory.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Second, caution. Be careful.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It would be terribly misleading to say that sins work for us an eternal weight of glory.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   In fact, sin in the Christian life is precisely what diminishes the weight of glory for the believer.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It says we must all face a judgment and receive our rewards or not, according to the fruit of the Spirit in our lives.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Second Corinthians 5.10, we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   whether good or evil.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And I think the best explanation for that is 1 Corinthians 3.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   If anyone has built on the foundation wood, hay, and stubble, it's going to be burned up.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And if he's burned with gold and silver and precious stones, it will be saved.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So if we go on sinning, that's like building with wood, hay, and stubble.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's not going to become a weight of glory for us.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's going to diminish our weight of glory.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Our cup of joy, using the analogy of Edwards, is made smaller by sinning,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and the cup of our joy is made bigger by suffering with patience and meekness and purity.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Blessed are the meek. They're going to inherit the earth.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Blessed are the pure. They're going to see God.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So my second observation is, no, your sinning is not adding to your weight of glory.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's diminishing the weight of glory.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And the third observation on the sin half of the question is, there is collateral damage when we sin that can last a lifetime.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   David's child died because of his sin. He lost his child, and that was a loss that lasted him a lifetime.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You might have a car wreck when you're going 60 miles an hour in a 45 mile an hour zone.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   That's sin. And you'd be paralyzed the rest of your life because you broke your neck.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Sinning. You broke your neck sinning.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Now, will that affliction caused by sin function to bring you to a greater weight of glory?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And my answer is, it can indeed. It can indeed.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   The collateral damage of sin is not sin.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Not all the effects of sin are sin.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   God can use them to make you rely more on him.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And that's how affliction works glory for us.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It makes us rely more on God.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Now, let me turn to the last part of the question.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   What about losing a ballgame?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Is that part of our afflictions that work for us in eternal weight of glory?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You just lost your ballgame, missed your field goal, and you were the kicker.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Or you miss an airplane, and you're going on vacation. You miss your flight.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Or it's prom night, and you wake up, you got a pimple right in the middle of your forehead.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Do those qualify for afflictions?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Suffered for Christ and working for an eternal weight of glory?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And before we laugh, think of it this way.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   All our troubles, all of them, are on a continuum from easy to horrible.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Where would you draw the line?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   These qualify for working out our glory, and these don't qualify.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   All our troubles, from the smallest to the greatest, have a potential to make us sin by grumbling.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And not trusting the goodness and wisdom of God.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Whether it's a pimple on prom night, or whether it's the loss of a child.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   That moment, that little or huge trouble, can make you sin or not.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And so it can become an occasion for casting yourself on Christ.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So my answer is, any trouble, from the smallest hiccup to the greatest horror.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I've always worried about having hiccups before I preach. Isn't that something?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It never happened. I was never kept out of the pulpit with hiccups.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And yet I've had hiccups, and I've been panicky almost.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Well anyway, you don't need to hear more of that.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   From the smallest hiccup to the greatest horror.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   If we endure these in the path of obedience to Jesus, they have the potential for working for us in eternal weight of glory.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Because the issue is, does it throw us on God as our help and our treasure and our joy?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   The girl that laughs at her pimple the night of the prom, and sees it as a small thing compared to her belonging to the King of the universe.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And the boy who springs back quickly after the high school football loss, because his identity and his joy is in Jesus.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   She and he have just experienced tiny afflictions that have produced big fruit of holiness, and that will be part of their reward.
