[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   I'm recording. Yeah. How's my
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.280]   hair, Nick? Do I look
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.960]   ridiculous? I should have
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.160]   wear a hat. Oh my God. I went
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.360]   to the
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.520]   teaching salon in for a
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.800]   haircut a few days ago.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.120]   The teaching salon.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.160]   $10. You got $10 worth of
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.440]   value. My neck was literally
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.040]   bleeding. The guy cut my neck
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.320]   like
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.480]   diagonal on the back.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.000]   He was stoned the whole time I
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.680]   walk in. He's like, What do you
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.960]   want? I'm like, I booked this
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.600]   thing. He's like, shit. Okay,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   sit down. I thought I was like
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.480]   in a barber shop.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.120]   Why would you possibly do that?
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.280]   There was nothing available. I
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.440]   told my wife, I'm like, get me
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440]   any hair appointment, anything.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.160]   I just gotta get my haircut.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.440]   It was so long. And then she's
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.000]   like, Oh, I got you an
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.680]   appointment at the
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.560]   teaching school. Oh, I'm like,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.360]   that's high end. All the hair
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.840]   salon stylists go there must be
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.720]   awesome. This guy fucking
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.280]   butchered me guys worth over
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.720]   100 million. He got a $10
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.680]   haircut, fucking $10. And then
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.440]   he's like, What would you like
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.800]   to tip?
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.080]   You should be a fucking barber.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.920]   Get a new career.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:18.800]   All right, everybody, welcome
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.600]   back to the all in podcast
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.640]   episode 141 Chamath Pali
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.960]   Hapitiya has gone missing
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.800]   somewhere in the
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.120]   Mediterranean. We've sent some
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.160]   search crews out. We got some
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.320]   beacons. We're trying to find
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.560]   him but he is not here today.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.880]   There will be no conspicuous
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.200]   consumption or discussion of
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.480]   truffle season wine. But
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.240]   instead, we went to the BG
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.280]   squared if you got to come to
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.440]   all in summit 2022. One of the
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   highlights of the event was
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.080]   having two BGs Brad Gerstner,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.000]   and Bill Gurley on the pod. So
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.680]   we thought for all star summer,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.080]   we would bring in some all
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.200]   stars here. Welcome back to the
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.840]   pod fifth bestie Brad Gerstner
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.760]   and Bill Gurley. How are you,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.240]   sir? I'm doing great. Thanks
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.160]   for having me on. Bill, you
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.040]   don't do a lot of press. You
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.320]   don't do a lot of pods. And I
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.440]   know you're on a lot of boards,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.480]   but you're not part of
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.720]   benchmarks next fund. So people
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.320]   are wondering, are you retiring?
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.600]   What are you up to? I know
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.640]   you're still got all these
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   boards you're on. But what's
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.920]   Bill Gurley up to these days?
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.080]   Yeah, appreciate that. Um, as
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.240]   you mentioned, I'm on nine
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.840]   benchmark boards still. So I'm
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.120]   working with those and doing
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.720]   the classic work that I've been
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.480]   doing my whole career. Second
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.040]   thing is I've started, I've
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.800]   done a handful of angel deals
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.520]   about one 100th the, um, the
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.960]   frequency of J Cal here, but a
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.560]   few, so dipping my toe in the
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.400]   water. And then third, I've
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.080]   been working hard on a book.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.600]   We've got a co-writer. We've
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.840]   been doing a ton of research.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.760]   We've got a proposal ready to
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.960]   go on an agent. We're going to
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.120]   go out to publisher soon. Oh,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   well, you should just do Harper
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.880]   business. I'll put you in touch
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.560]   with Hollis. That's the winning
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.600]   publisher. That's the best
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.840]   business publisher in the world.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.400]   Perfect.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.920]   Harper Harper Collins business
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   number one publisher, publisher.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.920]   And you don't need what the
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.640]   thesis is.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.560]   Yeah, it's a further
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.720]   development of a speech I gave
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.440]   at the university of Texas
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.720]   business school about how to
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.040]   chase and succeed in your dream
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.640]   job. Oh, nice. Oh, so like
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.840]   career advice, letter to a
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.280]   younger girly. Is that what this
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   is? A letter to a younger
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.840]   builder? I didn't want to do
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.240]   like, Oh, here's my thoughts on
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.360]   venture capital. That didn't
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.440]   feel right. This is something
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.840]   I'm more passionate about. And
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.600]   I, some might, I hope will be
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.880]   impactful to a lot of people.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.360]   I've already gotten quite a bit
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.560]   of feedback from people that
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.400]   have been moved by the, the,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.040]   the shorter version on the, uh,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.400]   on the presentation.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.880]   What would you, when you look
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.280]   back on your career, unpack it
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.160]   for a minute, um, what, what do
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.640]   you think the things you got
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.560]   right were or the things, you
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.480]   know, you might change in terms
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.760]   of your career and being happy
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.600]   and finding your passion.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.160]   Yeah, I do feel super fortunate
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   that I was able to do, you know,
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.840]   my, my dream job for over two
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.040]   decades. And I love innovation.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.320]   I love betting and gambling.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.960]   And I love the combination of
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.360]   being able to think through
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.000]   markets and disruptions and to
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.640]   be able to place bets and all
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.000]   those things are super exciting.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.240]   Things I got right, um, studying
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.680]   history, which is something I
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.360]   talk a lot about, and we'll be
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.640]   talking about in the, in the
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.520]   book, like knowing who the, the
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.480]   patriarchs were of your industry
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.040]   and knowing what they thought I
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.520]   think is super powerful in any
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.720]   endeavor. And then networking,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.240]   you know, just like crazy, which
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.760]   I think is actually easier today.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.000]   So those are a couple of the
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.400]   themes that we developed.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.480]   Networking and studying history
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.000]   specifically, you and I have had
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.080]   many conversations about
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.800]   biographies. We both share a
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.200]   passion for those top biographies,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.840]   not of business people, but that
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.000]   had an impact on you. And then
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.040]   I'll go around the horn top
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.600]   biographies that had an impact on
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.080]   you, preferably ones that are in
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.120]   business, but if it is business, I
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.720]   guess it's okay.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.440]   One that actually led to me
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.080]   developing this theme was, was
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.520]   learning more about Danny Meyer's
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.440]   journey, who is the renowned
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.080]   restaurant owner in New York City
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.600]   and the founder of Shake Shack.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.680]   But he had a career where he was
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.440]   in sales, he was about to go to
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.920]   law school. And as I think his
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.000]   uncle told him, what are you
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.680]   doing? You know, you want to be a
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.920]   restaurant owner. And he stopped
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.240]   that day, took a job at 10k a
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.280]   month, or 10k a year, he took
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.680]   like a 90% pay cut and started
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.400]   studying. And that gets into the
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.760]   history part, but he just started
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.720]   studying and obviously the rest
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.400]   of this history. For those of you
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.440]   that know about Danny Meyer.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.680]   Setting the table is the book.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.400]   And that is the book Union Square
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.200]   Cafe, Gramercy Tavern amongst some
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.400]   of his great restaurants going
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.680]   around the horn here, Friedberg.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.520]   You have a favorite biography you
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.800]   read or something that impacted
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.200]   you young in your career? And then
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.080]   do you feel like you figured it
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.800]   out? And what did you what would
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.960]   you change about the early part of
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.920]   your career? So the same two
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.280]   questions?
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.800]   That's a three very loaded
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.040]   questions. I don't know how to
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.000]   pick which one you want to answer
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.160]   that one. I will tell you when I
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.720]   was running my company in 2011.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.440]   Climate. Yeah, the climate
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.360]   corporation. I read the Walter
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.080]   Isaacson biography of Steve jobs.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.240]   Yeah. And he actually profiled a
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.720]   number of jobs as management
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.480]   techniques. My only operating
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.880]   role prior to that was working at
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.440]   Google. So that was the only
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.040]   management experience or exposure
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   I had had. And then reading about
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.520]   how jobs ran his management team,
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.280]   it actually changed my behavior
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.720]   going into the office. I
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.080]   took a very different approach
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.920]   and I saw the results almost
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.680]   immediately.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   What was the primary thing that
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.320]   impacted you?
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.720]   Well, first of all, like having
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.400]   the cadence and the and the
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.760]   directness with the team,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.160]   engaging the team fully in
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.480]   discourse, immediately making
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.440]   decisions, getting everyone to
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.600]   commit moving forward very
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.040]   quickly. I was the first time CEO
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.120]   so I never had a good mentor. And
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.840]   reading those segments of jobs as
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.960]   management style in his biography
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.720]   was just a really great tool to
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.960]   add to my emerging toolkit on how
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.000]   to be a manager and how to be a
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.440]   CEO and how to run a company.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.040]   That was big for me. I could
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.280]   rehash everything about early on
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.320]   in my life. I don't think that's
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.040]   a good use of
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.520]   Walter Isaacson's book on Elon
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.200]   coming out in a couple of weeks,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.480]   which should be interesting. I
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   sat for an interview with Walter
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.640]   for that one. So I'm interested
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.680]   to see how that turns out.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.040]   Yeah, I did too.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.360]   I was asked to I didn't. Yeah,
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.920]   we were asked to
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.440]   didn't do it.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.440]   No, I did it. I did it. I you
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.480]   know, I don't. I didn't ask to
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.760]   do it. I got asked, you know, if
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.200]   I would write give some anecdotes.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.360]   I think sacks also got asked if
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.400]   he would do some anecdotes. So I
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.360]   think it's gonna be pretty good.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.880]   And Walter was hanging around
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.520]   putting passages out on Twitter,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.720]   right? Yeah, I mean, he's such a
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.320]   good writer. And just watching
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.760]   him, you know, David, and I were
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.880]   at Twitter for a little bit. And
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.920]   you know, just being
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.760]   he was hanging out. He was like,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.360]   you know, in the corner of the
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.200]   room, like participating in a lot
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.360]   of these meetings. Yeah. So he
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.280]   was there basically during the
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.200]   whole transition. And I think
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.360]   that was going to be the ending
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.040]   of the book is, you know, he had
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.240]   to cut it off at some point, but
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.400]   he was there for the first month
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.160]   of the transition. Yeah, the
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.960]   Twitter takeover,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.480]   and for rocket launches and
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.120]   everything in between. So he I
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.360]   mean, watching his biography
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.160]   technique is, it's pretty
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.680]   intense. And he spends a long
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.680]   time with the subjects. And, you
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.200]   know, just taking notes and
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.240]   talking to everybody around him.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.960]   So he would, you know, peel off
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.840]   sacks or peel me off. Hey, could
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.680]   I ask you a question about this
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.280]   or ask a question? What do you
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   think of this? What do you think
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.480]   of this? J. Cal speaking of
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.680]   books, I'm in the rare position
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.560]   of needing your advice. Oh,
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.000]   okay.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.360]   I think that's a compliment.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.560]   Sort of a compliment. Okay. So
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.600]   Harper Collins. I'm going to do
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.200]   a book about how to create run
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.440]   scale operate software companies,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.240]   which will be an extension of
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.160]   the blog I've been writing for a
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.640]   couple of years, which I haven't
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.760]   been active on, mainly because
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.800]   I've been using that time for
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.920]   this pod. But I was writing at a
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.040]   giga clip until we started doing
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.720]   all in pod. Yeah, I want to get
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.200]   back to putting that together.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.480]   Yes. And I could go chapter by
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.840]   chapter, you know, here's how
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.680]   you should think about marketing.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   Here's how you should think about
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.640]   sales. Here's how you should
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.360]   think about finance metrics, and
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.520]   so on. But I'm not sure that's
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.400]   the best way to present the
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.320]   material. So yeah, do I just
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.760]   write the book that I think it
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.720]   should be? Or do I work with a
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.280]   publisher on what the business
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.760]   book should be? And they kind of
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.800]   give me the guidance? So it's a
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.440]   great question.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.200]   You are in a unique position
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.640]   where, you know, you're
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.080]   successful, you have an audience
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.440]   for the book and success for you
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.240]   is for you know, great founders
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   to read the book and for it to
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.720]   have impact, as opposed to
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.600]   somebody who's an author who
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   just wants to be published,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.520]   right. So you have a different
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.160]   reason to do this. I think you
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160]   should write the book, you
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.200]   should decide who you want the
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.520]   audience to be and what you want
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.920]   to get out of the book. And you
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.160]   should forget about publishers
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.360]   in the whole grand scheme of
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.040]   things. Then when you write the
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.160]   treatment, you write the first
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.040]   five chapters or so, then you
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.080]   can bring it to a select group
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.560]   of publishers, you can get an
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.600]   agent, I can introduce it to
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.240]   three agents, there's, you know,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.600]   top two or three in this field.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.040]   And I think what you should do
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.760]   is, the business advice is out
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.400]   there, right? And the techniques
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.120]   are out there. But what you have
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.800]   is you have war stories. So the
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.000]   technique I used in my book
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.600]   angel was to, you know, talk
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.000]   about techniques and investing
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.960]   that I had learned from other
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.400]   folks, including Bill Gurley,
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.040]   Michael Moritz, or whatever. But
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.400]   then I would give my anecdotes,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.840]   things I had experienced before
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.280]   and it's personally. And what
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.080]   that does is it makes the
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.760]   examples let people really get
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.920]   some narrative out of the book.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.040]   And so the lesson combined with
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.800]   the actual practical experience,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.200]   that's kind of the magic of
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.360]   these business books, I think.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.640]   Do you have a favorite biography
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.360]   yourself, Saks either business or
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.000]   non business?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.320]   I don't think I read a lot of
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.240]   business biographies. Really, I
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.280]   read one business how to book
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   back in the PayPal days, you
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.640]   know, I didn't have any real
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.680]   business education.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.240]   Good to great. Do you remember
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.240]   what it was? It was good to
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.520]   great. Yeah. I mean, that was
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.800]   the seminal book at the time.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.600]   So I read this book, and
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.240]   literally, one chapter was on
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   how you should stick to your
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.600]   core idea. And then the next
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.440]   chapter was about how you should
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.080]   be flexible. Like, well, both of
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.360]   these ideas are right
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.400]   situationally. Yes. But so how
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.520]   do you decide? So I came away
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.600]   from the book thinking this
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.560]   isn't really going to help me
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.440]   because it doesn't give you what
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.000]   you really need, which is what
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.040]   are the specific situations in
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.960]   which you should apply a given
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.520]   principle?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.480]   Yes. And I kind of came away
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.120]   from like thinking that business
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.000]   self help books just weren't
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.640]   that they're too theoretical and
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.560]   weren't that helpful.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.120]   But then this is where biography
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.240]   is really become helpful because
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.480]   you actually get to see why that
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.200]   you know, technique was
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.440]   deployed. Brad, do you have any
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.000]   business bios that you
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.240]   know, related to that about
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.880]   Saks, Saks do not write a how to
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.520]   book? Yeah, right. Write a book
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.840]   about your visceral experiences.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.560]   Right? That just you happen to
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.920]   teach people how to along the
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.480]   way, right? You have a lot of,
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.000]   you know, I just think the story
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.280]   is powerful.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:22.720]   Is it calling zoom bombing when
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.040]   you just
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.200]   guys? Thank you to the Starlink
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.680]   team yet again coming to the
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.280]   rescue.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.480]   What is this?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.840]   No, no, I just wanted to come
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.240]   and say hi.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.080]   You have to hang.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.960]   This is the black mirror version
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.720]   of the Brady Bunch.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.920]   What happened? Are you lost at
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   sea? We tried to get you find
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.240]   you on the yacht was missing the
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.120]   dinghies missing. We sent out
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.120]   search crews.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.840]   Hold on your camera and go you
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.240]   look like Tiger Woods in this
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.560]   shot. A guy a guy that I work
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.320]   with such much you're the
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.720]   Michael Bridges of the online
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.000]   podcast and that you haven't
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.560]   missed a podcast since the
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.760]   beginning. So then that's the
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.160]   only reason why I'm coming into
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.280]   this in your head. Yeah, it's in
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.800]   my head. I just want to say
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.600]   love you guys. Enjoy the pod.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.320]   I'll talk to you later. I'll
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.800]   watch.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.280]   Bye bye. The Iron Man Street
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.040]   continues. I want to get my
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.080]   remodeling. He's drunk. He
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.240]   thought he was a drunk zoomed
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:27.560]   on.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.120]   Yeah, remember he's nine hours
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.280]   ahead. J Cal to answer your
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.560]   question. Yes, please. Teddy
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.000]   Roosevelt man in the arena Phil
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.600]   Knight, Alexander Hamilton,
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.640]   those three for me that like to
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.440]   take away the the red thread
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   that connects them is do shit
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.920]   that matters. Do stuff that
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   matters. Your life is short. Get
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.240]   in the arena major in the majors
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.560]   but do stuff that matters. So
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.720]   they all were inspirations for
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.840]   me both in terms of how I
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.720]   organized my own life, but also
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.080]   how I think about investing.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.560]   Fantastic. And I'll give you a
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.120]   couple of ones that you may not
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.200]   have thought of something like
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.160]   an autobiography. The biography
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.200]   of Akira Kurosawa, the famous
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.040]   film director. Absolutely
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.840]   outstanding.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.320]   Great recommendation. I'm gonna
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.520]   I actually want to read that.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:10.960]   That's a great
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.520]   recommendation. I'll read that
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.960]   who wrote it. Akira Kurosawa.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.800]   It's an autobiography.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.680]   It's his autobiography.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   Autobiography. Oh,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.000]   born standing up. Steve Martin,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.640]   Bill Gurley and talked about
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.560]   this one. And it really is
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.120]   fantastic. I've actually listened
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.760]   to it twice. And that's one of
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.440]   the great things about these
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   biographies. You listen to him
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.880]   a second time. Here's another
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.440]   one. sax. This is critical for
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.840]   you on writing. Oh,
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.400]   you've listened to it.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:37.800]   Who's by
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.720]   a frequent cast.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   Stephen King.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.760]   Oh, Stephen King.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.080]   On writing might be top five for
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.960]   me of all time. And he really
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.400]   goes into, like the story of
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.960]   Harry. He wrote like a small
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.240]   treatment of Harry. He was a
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.280]   math teacher, he threw it in the
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.320]   garbage, because he was so
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.720]   frustrated with his wife sees it
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.640]   in the garbage. She reads it.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.840]   She says, this is incredible.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.560]   You should keep writing it. He
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.720]   writes it. He sells the book for
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.240]   $10,000. He's getting paid like
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.360]   $9,000. As a teacher, he can't
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.560]   quit his job. And back in the
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.680]   day, they used to sell your
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.600]   hardcover rights and your
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.400]   paperback rights separately. If
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.040]   your hardcover went well, then
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.680]   you would do a paperback and go
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.280]   mass market. He gets a call,
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.160]   they sold the rights to the mass
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.480]   market book $400,000, the
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.480]   paperback, that his agent gets
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.160]   on the phone and says it's
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.600]   $40,000. And he thinks he hears
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.560]   40,000. He says, well, $40,000.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.400]   That's incredible. That's four
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.760]   years, I might be able to quit
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.840]   my job as a teacher, because
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.880]   then it's 400,000 says, Okay, so
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.040]   $40,000 divided by nine, it's
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.640]   maybe it's even closer to five
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.040]   years. He says, No, you're
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.560]   getting 400,000. You can't
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.040]   believe it. And that was
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.160]   basically the story about
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.840]   Stephen King.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.040]   But it'd be great, great to
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.240]   listen to prior to writing a
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.960]   book. He's absolutely it's
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.200]   super amazing. Most people don't
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   know this fact, but King wrote
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.440]   the novella that became
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.080]   Shawshank.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.520]   Absolutely. Yes. Right. He's
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.040]   got a lot of those you didn't
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   know it. And then the Malcolm X
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.520]   biography is amazing, too, if
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.760]   you haven't read it. So those
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.800]   are just non traditional ones of
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.400]   people following their passion.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.680]   One of the things about it is
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.960]   the extreme effort in the
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.760]   decades of perfecting craft that
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.240]   I found super appealing about
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.560]   these. Nothing happens easily.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.160]   In your honor, J. Cal the rest
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.120]   of the episode, seven seven
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.720]   summers to share seven samurai
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   by the way, if you're a startup
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.600]   founder, entrepreneur, CEO, best
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.160]   film to watch, because
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.520]   team well, yeah, I mean, there
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.560]   is no, there is no giving up.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.040]   You do what it takes. And you
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.680]   persist. I think persistence is
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   one of the biggest I've talked
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.400]   about is one of the biggest
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.800]   predictors for success. And
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.560]   there's a character that emerges.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.280]   Once you're facing challenge,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.880]   this film does such an
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.520]   incredible job of demonstrating
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.560]   the essence of that character.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.320]   Yeah, I think it's also a
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.480]   similar character that's needed
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.720]   in
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.840]   but if you read for a
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.120]   summer's biography, you'll see
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.680]   that a number of the actors in
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.200]   that film occur in other films
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:00.800]   by
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.400]   Kurosawa,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.480]   who that stars
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:05.760]   the
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.880]   to share a muffooning. Yeah.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.080]   Yeah. Who is all of he's just
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.640]   about an all
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.400]   was his muse. He was he was
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   score to De Niro to score
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   Shazam. Yes, or Shazam sort of
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.040]   modeled his relationship with
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.080]   De Niro after Kurosawa and
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.560]   George Lucas, Kurosawa,
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.000]   Francis Ford Coppola were all
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.600]   disciples of Kurosawa was, you
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.440]   know, credible.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.280]   Well, the seven samurai was
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.920]   remade as a Western. The
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.560]   Renaissance seven with I think
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.040]   Steve McQueen and Yul Brynner.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yep. A lot of Kurosawa movies
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.520]   were remade as Westerns. Yeah,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.760]   it just works pretty well.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.560]   And they were they were all
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.280]   scored by any Amore Connie. A
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.480]   lot of them by you know, Mark
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.320]   Carney, which I was listening
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.560]   to in the cold plunge. I
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.800]   started in the cold. Oh my
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.920]   god, I just like to say just a
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.400]   hearty fuck you. This is such a
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.520]   random show. We have not.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.920]   Well, we'll get there. But I
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.960]   mean, I just want to start the
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.120]   podcast by saying fuck you to
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.240]   go. Is there anything else
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.960]   that's gonna be talking about
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.720]   on the show? I'm like, I don't
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.400]   think so. Joe Rogan and all
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.520]   these assholes who said in
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.320]   order to be like, successful,
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.360]   you have to jump in a cold
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.120]   plunge. Because now I've done
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.480]   it four times out of the last
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.760]   like, I'm doing it every other
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.560]   day. And they're right. I feel
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.040]   like a superhero after I do
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.280]   this. Anybody doing cold plunge
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.560]   here besides me and Shama?
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.600]   Nobody.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.840]   Okay, well, I mean, I was in
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.680]   Mexico bills occasionally. And
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.960]   they had this this this cold
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.160]   plunge thing. And I we did it
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.120]   every day that we were there at
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.440]   the hotel. But then we came
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.600]   back. Well, it's you get this
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.000]   endorphin run chat rush
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.120]   afterwards. It's incredible.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.160]   And then afterwards, now when I
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.440]   go to the gym, I only do like a
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.640]   10 minute ice cold shower
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.000]   afterwards. Like it's critical
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.280]   to like, and it feels amazing.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.760]   You feel like so relaxed after
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.600]   you did six, I did five or six
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.120]   minutes at 58 degrees. I've been
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.240]   lowering it two degrees a day.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.280]   But the first day I did it at
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.840]   43 or 44. For like 45 seconds,
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.120]   and my body started shaking. I
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.520]   got hypothermia instantly Bill
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.720]   you've done it. You've done this
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.160]   nonsense.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.440]   Occasionally, occasionally. I'm
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.720]   still not convinced there's any
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.480]   medical benefit to it. But you
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.560]   guys, you've sent around. It's
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.240]   very trendy.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.560]   It's very
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.520]   I haven't inference on pickleball.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.040]   So I'm doing inference on
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.520]   motorcycle bikes, right?
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.160]   And motorcycle bikes.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.480]   cold.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.040]   My last week has been failure.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.800]   You just take your take your
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.080]   bike into the cold plunge.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.160]   Ride it into the arena. And then
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.760]   you go play pickleball. Yeah.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.360]   Okay. And you're wondering why
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.520]   everybody hates us. Lifestyles
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.680]   of the abhorrent. 1% All right,
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.080]   listen,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.440]   speaking of a couple other
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   rentals that are Kurosawa films
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.720]   are worth watching. Actually, he
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.320]   did. He did versions of
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.400]   Shakespeare, which I think is
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.080]   really interesting. Absolutely.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.840]   So Kurosawa took on Shakespeare
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.000]   and then Hollywood kind of
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.760]   adapted Kurosawa. But a couple
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.160]   of really good ones thrown a
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.000]   blood was Kurosawa was
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.160]   adaptation of Macbeth. And then
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.080]   ran was his adaptation of King
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.440]   Lear, two of my favorites worth
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:01.960]   checking out
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.160]   Hidden Fortress. Also great.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.080]   In fortress became the basis for
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.240]   Star Wars. It was a big
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:07.840]   influence.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.600]   Yeah, the R2D2 and c3p characters
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.680]   c3po characters who are like sort
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.000]   of telling the story are in the
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.920]   hidden fortress. You can see the
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.160]   direct descendants here. But for
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.760]   me, the genre I love for
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.000]   Kurosawa is his film the wa era
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.640]   stray dog. I allow I mean, these
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.080]   are exceptional films and high
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.480]   and low I wanted to remake when I
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.760]   was thinking about being a film
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.640]   director and it turns out
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.200]   Spielberg owns the rights. High
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.040]   and low. Incredible story. But
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.520]   we digress here.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.280]   Let's get to the guy you just
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.760]   want one last anecdote. Okay,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.880]   the TV show Breaking Bad. Yes,
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.040]   inspired by a cure. The Kurosawa
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.760]   film. Yeah, that a guy who finds
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.880]   out he's gonna die. And when he
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.720]   finds out he's gonna die,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.520]   suddenly he becomes one of my
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.320]   favorite self like was this true
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.080]   like nature comes out. So
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.600]   incredibly poignant film that
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.360]   obviously inspired the
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.520]   extraordinary TV show Breaking
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.080]   Bad. Yeah,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.120]   Akira is means to live in
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.760]   Japanese. And this is a story of
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.880]   somebody who's basically lived a
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.320]   modest amid is somebody who
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.880]   lived a mid life. But then at
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.160]   the end decides he wants to do
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.560]   something meaningful with his
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.000]   little pittance of money and to
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.080]   make an impact on the world. And
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   so he decides he's going to take
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.960]   a parking lot that's disgusting
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   and filled with garbage and make
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.600]   it into a kid's playground. So
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.960]   people can enjoy their life. It
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.760]   is. And it's also it's to share
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.880]   a mufune as an old man. So in a
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.440]   way this parallels their careers
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.760]   and trying to do something
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.760]   important. There's another one I
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.440]   live in fear. So those two to
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.680]   live and I live in fear about
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.040]   aging and getting old at the
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:43.960]   genre. If you don't know,
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.520]   Akira Kurosawa, you know, just
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.400]   you're going to need to be a
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.280]   little patient because it
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.880]   doesn't have 1000 cuts per
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.560]   minute. Like modern films. It's
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   not the Transformers or a Marvel
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.840]   film, but it's well worth it if
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.880]   you can get your ADHD under
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.200]   control. I would start with my
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:58.720]   movies.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.000]   Yeah, seven samurai thrown to
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.040]   blood and ran.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.320]   Here you go there. And then
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.360]   there's I mean, if you want to
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.400]   go super intellectual Rashomon
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.760]   Yeah, which is about truth
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.640]   every people's different
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.360]   perspective. Every film theory
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.480]   class starts with Ross and more.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.280]   Yeah, so there's your USC film
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.480]   school divergence.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.160]   Save 100 grand. Okay,
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.880]   we'll see you all at UCLA. Okay,
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.360]   VC market update. Carta has
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.720]   released a series a funding map
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.760]   covering the first half of 2023.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.520]   But the data is what's
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.760]   interesting. They covered and
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.880]   Carta basically manages
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.480]   capitables and stuff like that
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.160]   for folks. Original company was
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.360]   he shares I think is a funding
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.760]   map which shows like how much
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.240]   money was raised. Nothing really
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.080]   too consequential in there. But
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.280]   what's really interesting is the
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   data on series a rounds series a
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.400]   rounds are typically the rounds
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.280]   when a benchmark or Sequoia a
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.920]   craft come in, and you know,
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.440]   join the board and put in a
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.120]   significant check. Before that
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.880]   you have angels and seed
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.280]   investors and after that you
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.080]   have growth funds. But the
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.200]   series A is considered like a
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.360]   seminal moment in the history of
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.720]   a startup. median round is now
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   7 million raised that's down 26%
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.960]   year over year. And this is all
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.640]   data from the first half of the
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.880]   year. So first half of 2023
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.560]   versus 2022, which was a really
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.680]   crummy year. We're down from the
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   crummy year 26% on the dollars
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.240]   raised 7 million. And the the
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.200]   pre money valuation 40 million
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.600]   down 17%. So last year, it was
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.720]   11 million raised on 48. I don't
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.280]   have the 2021 data here, but it
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.360]   would be even more. So just
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.600]   right off the bat, reactions,
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.160]   I'm sorry, you build early to
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.600]   what we're seeing in the series.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.000]   A space is a return to normalcy.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.280]   I mean, the series is back in
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.040]   the you know, Uber days and
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.800]   Airbnb days were what 510 million
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.240]   bucks on a 30 million. So this
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.640]   is a return to normalcy.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.840]   Yeah, I don't I don't think
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.520]   you've gone quite back to that
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.720]   line. Right. And so I think
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.000]   there's still a significant
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.960]   amount of competition at that
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.080]   level. And the fact that it's
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.120]   off a little bit is is noteworthy.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.080]   But it's not like off 50%. Right.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.600]   I think that market remains
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.400]   competitive. I think there's a
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.760]   number of great people out
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.200]   there investing at that level.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.640]   And I and of course, the AI
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.920]   deals, like one thing that might
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.280]   be interesting is if you pull the
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.040]   ideals out, I bet those numbers
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.360]   would be more akin to what they
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.720]   were two or three years ago,
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.320]   because those are being done at
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:36.960]   200.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.640]   Is the reason you went to angel
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.760]   investing or seed investing,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.920]   let's call it because it's so
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.800]   crowded and competitive at the
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.840]   series a level and what seed
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.600]   investing is now is what series a
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.120]   investing was for the 20 years of
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:51.600]   your career.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.040]   Now,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.080]   okay.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.160]   I think if I were practicing,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.600]   institutionally, I would I would
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.200]   stay at the series a level and
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.960]   take board seats and try and get
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.440]   as much ownership as possible,
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.240]   which is the been the benchmark
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.000]   strategy I I am. This is more of
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.080]   a hobby thing for me. Got it. And
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.200]   I don't want more seats anymore.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.480]   But it's super, super crowded at
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.080]   series a still to this day. Yeah,
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.280]   I said it was competitive. I
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.520]   don't know that it's super
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.400]   crowded. I think a lot of people
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.080]   realize that if you can get two
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.240]   and a half or 3% management fee
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.960]   investing $300 million at a pop,
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.440]   that's an easier lifestyle than
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.960]   actually taking board seats and
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.640]   doing work. And so I think a lot
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.000]   of money and activity got pulled
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.600]   into the late stage market.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.960]   Nearly every firm started doing
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.800]   that. And once the once the
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.480]   center of gravity goes there in a
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.040]   firm, you know, in your investing
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.960]   200 million a clip, can you
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.520]   imagine the Monday meetings like
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.640]   who's paying attention to the
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.320]   person that's putting 5 million
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.920]   out at a time? Like it'd be hard
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.360]   it's like going to playing high
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.720]   stakes cards, and then you get
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.880]   invited to you're playing
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.480]   exactly 100 200. And you go to
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.120]   510 game. It's like it's if
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.360]   there's a team and who's paying
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.640]   attention to the person playing
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.520]   in the little game. And so I
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.720]   actually think the number of
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.360]   people that practice at that
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.320]   level has actually gone down.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.680]   Huh? But that doesn't mean you
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.720]   know, the business since I got
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.880]   in, only got more competitive.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.400]   And so there's still enough. And
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.880]   the other thing is the founders
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.640]   have learned how to play. However,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.040]   if there's 10 people doing it,
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.160]   they know how to play them off
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.320]   of one another. They're very
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.040]   skilled at it.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.680]   Yeah, that's, that's a weird
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.760]   thing that happened is like the
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.200]   playbook, because of podcasts,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.880]   because of blog posts, I mean,
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.080]   just how to how to run a company.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.440]   And then, you know, how to, you
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.280]   know, negotiate with VCs is it's
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.920]   all been unpacked. Saks, what are
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.600]   you seeing? You're a series a
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.520]   investor, you compete with the
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.120]   sequoias, the benchmarks, heads
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.400]   up for the series A's, what are
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.520]   you seeing in the series A? And
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.560]   what do you take from this data
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.320]   being down 26% year over year,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.440]   which probably actually means
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.160]   probably 50% down from the peak?
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.880]   What are the thoughts?
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.520]   Well, yeah, the the venture
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.440]   capital market peaked in q4 of
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.520]   2021, in terms of both
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.000]   valuations and the amount of
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.280]   money that was being deployed,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.920]   and it kept going down throughout
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.520]   all of 2022. And I think it
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.440]   bottomed out in q1 of 2023,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.760]   basically in the last several
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.240]   months. And I think now, the pace
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.520]   of deployment has sort of
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.120]   stabilized. And it's kind of
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.840]   stabilized at a pre pandemic
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.760]   level. So you know, maybe a
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.280]   2019 level. Now, I think that
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.360]   probably mass and big
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.640]   differences by round. So like
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.920]   you're saying, series A rounds
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.400]   are more competitive, there's
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.840]   relatively more action there, I
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.120]   think the late stage rounds,
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.720]   Brad can speak to this, the
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.200]   capital there is dried up, I
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.120]   think, considerably more. And
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.440]   those rounds are much harder to
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.560]   get. And the reason I think is
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.240]   because that when you have more
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.520]   operating history, then it's
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.160]   harder to raise around based on
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.600]   narrative. Whereas when you're
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.840]   at a very early stage, you can
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.400]   basically just raise money based
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.040]   on a dream.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.440]   And the way I frame it to people
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.480]   is when I'm part of this is my
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.160]   fault, because I'm training
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.680]   people in our accelerators and
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.800]   pre accelerators, I tell them
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.840]   you're either selling promise or
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.720]   performance. And you know, once
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.200]   you start having customers and
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.440]   numbers and retention, you know,
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.520]   someone like sacks is gonna be
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.480]   like, give me the data. And
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.320]   they're gonna look at churn and
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.240]   say, yeah, this business is too
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.320]   much churn, it's leaky bucket,
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.480]   whatever. But when you're selling
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.320]   promise, it's a lot easier than
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.240]   selling performance.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.400]   I'll tell you guys a CEO that is
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.120]   a well known CEO, public company
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.840]   now. He told me, and I think
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.680]   girly, I think you guys were
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.880]   investors. He said, as soon as we
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.680]   started having revenue, our
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.360]   valuation felt like it went down
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.240]   as soon as we started making
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.720]   profit, our valuation went down.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.080]   Because at that point, you're,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.400]   you know, you're judged on the
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.040]   quality of that stage of the
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.720]   business. Whereas before, you
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.320]   could paint a picture with 1000
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.120]   words about the different paths
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.280]   you might walk and everyone
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.720]   wants to believe the optimistic
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.200]   path will be walked. And so you
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.840]   can boost your valuation boost
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.400]   investor interest. But once
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.200]   those numbers start to come
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.600]   through, it really changes the
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.880]   investor criteria for how they
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.560]   assess the value of the
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.040]   business.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.480]   To a lot of people will state if
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.840]   they have a product launch
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.440]   coming, though, those tell you
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.080]   to raise money before you want
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.680]   to sell the promise of that
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.440]   launch. Yes,
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.720]   old saying it's better to raise
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.200]   on the sizzle than on the steak.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.920]   Hmm. Yeah. Unless the steak is
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.560]   pretty high grade. Obviously,
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.960]   if the steak is great, then
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.440]   yes, that's the best time to
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.880]   take that risk off the table.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.760]   Yeah. But but just to recap, I
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.480]   think where we are. I think the
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.680]   venture capital markets have
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.520]   stabilized for funding new
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.640]   companies. I think there's a
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.520]   mania going on with AI both in
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.560]   terms of the size of these
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.880]   rounds and the valuations. It's
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.080]   like 2021 for a lot of AI
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.480]   companies. We're not
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.320]   participating in that craziness.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.640]   We are doing some seed checks.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.360]   I would say and early stage AI
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.320]   companies were kind of
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.440]   calibrating the size of the
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.640]   check with the stage and amount
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.560]   of risk. And I think that's
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.160]   appropriate.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.560]   So you are going pre series a
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.760]   seed putting in that's a 500 k
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.720]   $1 million check.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.120]   Seed is what makes the most
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.000]   sense I think for AI startups
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.160]   because if you wait for a later
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.840]   round, then they're not being
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.440]   priced based on fundamentals.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.640]   Yeah, yeah. So what check size
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.960]   is that 500 k million?
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.520]   We just did one of
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.560]   a $4 million check where he led
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.760]   kind of a bigger seed round.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.880]   Got it. Fantastic. I love that
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.120]   those are called seed rounds
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:34.520]   today.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.280]   I mean, it used to be three to
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.760]   5 million was your series a but
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.080]   yeah, sure. seed round three to
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.520]   five. I still don't understand
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.440]   the term pre seed.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.560]   So just to finish the thought I
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.720]   think where we're at and you
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.320]   know, Brad can can chime in on
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.680]   this is I think the venture
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.000]   capital market has stabilized
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.640]   for new companies new
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.400]   fundraising. However, I think
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.320]   there's going to be a one to
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.280]   two year period of distress for
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.440]   all these companies that raised
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.360]   in the peak. Yep. 2020 2021 and
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.720]   are now running out of money and
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.680]   they don't have enough revenue.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.720]   They're not growing fast enough.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   And or their burn is too high.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.160]   And all those companies are
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.720]   gonna be facing down rounds or
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.120]   restructurings or they're not
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.960]   gonna be able to raise.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.600]   Well, people are also marking
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.640]   their books. Now we're starting
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.600]   to see the marking
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.960]   markdown. And we're gonna have
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.040]   probably a one to two year
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.120]   period of distress for all those
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.800]   bubble companies while we have a
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.080]   little bit of a resurgence for
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.800]   new companies.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.920]   I got another topic I'm going to
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.680]   go to here related but Brad I
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.800]   just wanted to let you chime in
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.760]   on the late stage there because
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.200]   you operate in the BC Sarah.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.560]   I think and this is related to
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.800]   the topic I suspect we're going
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.960]   to transition to but listen,
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.600]   there is a lot of activity in
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.160]   venture today. Right. And we're
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.560]   very reflective to the stock
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.640]   market. People were really
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.720]   scared in q3 and q4 of 2022
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.360]   started in 2021. But cute. 2022
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.040]   was scary to people because
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.480]   public market valuations for
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.760]   growth companies were down over
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.400]   50%. So we really saw, you know,
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.440]   IPO markets venture all start to
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.520]   slow down. Coming out of that
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.640]   we've seen you know, stock
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   market within, you know, 10% of
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.520]   all time highs. We see you know,
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.320]   this wave of AI occurring, what I
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.360]   would tell you is under 500
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.760]   million, maybe under 600 million,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.560]   right series B and C rounds are
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.080]   as hot as I've ever seen them.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.520]   And data infrastructure and AI
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.360]   and software, etc. So there is a
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.160]   lot of competition there. The
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.640]   later stage stuff, which as you
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.440]   know, I call quasi public. So if
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.840]   a company is over a billion
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.280]   dollars, right now you're, you're
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.920]   very reflective relative to
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   what's happening in the public
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.680]   markets. We're starting to see
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.440]   activity I just read whiz raise
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.760]   more money. It's got $200
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.320]   million ARR raised at 10 billion.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.040]   So those markets are definitely
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.640]   times revenue. Yeah, we did not
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.400]   participate. But 50 times
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.560]   revenue, you know, so there is
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.000]   definitely activity. I know a
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.600]   deal we got called on yesterday
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.000]   raising two and a half billion
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.920]   at 100 billion. There is a lot
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.360]   of activity. However, Saks is
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.800]   right. There is, you know,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.600]   remember, we had 1000 unicorns
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.720]   at the end of 2021. And I've
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.320]   said 100% of those are going to
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   do a down round. And we're still
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.400]   in the early stages of that
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.640]   reset to occur. There was some,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.920]   you know, there's a report out
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.960]   this week that lots of people
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.240]   comment on Twitter where public
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.000]   markets were down 50% and
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.560]   private marks were down, I don't
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.640]   know, five to 10%. Like that
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.480]   will all normalize, it's all
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.960]   going to be down, you know, the
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.720]   same. So that's the only place I
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.920]   don't see activity under
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.360]   performant companies that were
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.000]   valued over a billion dollars.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Those are dead on arrival until
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.280]   you get to a market clearing
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.000]   price. And we're not there yet.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.560]   Okay, so the other big issue here
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.800]   is a lot of money was raised by
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.840]   VCs. Oh, you know, commonly known
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.600]   as dry powder in the industry.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.760]   But there are some
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.160]   misconceptions about this dry
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.240]   powder, people are saying, Oh my
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.160]   god, all this money is going to
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.040]   come flowing into the ecosystem
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.920]   kumbaya, it's going to be the
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.080]   roaring 20s. Again. However, Bill,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.320]   you did a little tweet storm,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.560]   what people don't realize is when
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.960]   we refer to dry powder at VC
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.080]   firms, the VCs do not have that
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.760]   $250 billion, or whatever it is
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.960]   quarter trillion dollars sitting
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.440]   in their bank accounts. That
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.640]   money is sitting in another
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.560]   person's bank account, LPS,
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.720]   Harvard's endowment, CalPERS,
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.680]   sovereign wealth funds, etc. It
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.640]   has not been drawn down by the
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.720]   VCs yet. So, Bill, why is this an
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.080]   important fact for people to
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   understand? And what are the
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.240]   dynamics that LPS are dealing
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:38.440]   with?
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.960]   Yeah, and there's a ton of
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.600]   dynamics between the GPS at the
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.480]   venture capitalist and the LPS at
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.560]   those endowments that Brad Brad
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.520]   started to hit on one of those,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.960]   which is the marks aren't in the
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.840]   right place. And, and so so the
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.040]   thing you just explained,
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.680]   critical Jason, which is you
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.920]   don't actually have the money.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.760]   There's no, there's no venture
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.360]   firm sitting around with, you
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   know, all the money that they've
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.800]   got committed to their fund in a
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.280]   bank account. This just take
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.080]   why not? Why does that not
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.160]   actually occur? Because people
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   would say, Oh, you raised a
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.320]   billion from these folks, they
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.520]   gave you the billion, right? Why
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.600]   do you want to take it down?
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.200]   One of the the brilliant
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.880]   realities of the way that a LP
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.240]   agreement works with a venture
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.080]   fund is they're not on the IRR
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.560]   clock until they actually pull
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.320]   the money down. So they explain
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.680]   what that means. They charge
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.200]   fees based on the total
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.640]   committed amount, but they don't
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.600]   actually draw the money down and
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   get gauged on the performance of
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.880]   their investment until they need
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.760]   it. And so a classic venture
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.200]   firm will do five, six drawdowns
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   over a 10 year period of a fund.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.720]   And so they don't act, they
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.960]   literally don't have the money.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.000]   A couple of other things worth
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.600]   noting. So, and some of that I
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.400]   didn't put in the tweet, but the
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.960]   marks aren't right. And everyone
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.520]   kind of quietly knows that the
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.160]   marks aren't right. But there's
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.720]   actually no incentive to get the
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.360]   marks right.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.800]   Explain what a mark is to folks.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.600]   So private companies have a
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.280]   valuation that's assessed either
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   by the GP themselves, in most
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.800]   cases, which is a bit of a
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.960]   conflict of interest, sometimes
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.800]   by your auditor, he and wire
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.040]   whoever's auditing your venture
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.440]   fund. But of course, the
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.520]   techniques they have for
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.080]   assessing valuation are
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.840]   extremely crude. Because they're
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.360]   not market based. They're just
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.960]   not public companies. Yeah. So
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.400]   there's actually not a way to
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.520]   know they have extremely
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.400]   complicated cap tables. The other
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.000]   thing is, many LPS are actually
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.760]   bonus on the paper mark. And this
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.560]   is something that a lot of people
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.280]   don't realize. And so they don't
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.960]   have an incentive to dial around
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.440]   to the GPS and say, get your
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.560]   marks, right, because it's
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.320]   actually gonna reflect poorly on
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.280]   them. If they were to roll those
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:51.520]   up,
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.960]   are both of the LP and the GP are
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.720]   in a dance there. Hey, we know
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.280]   that stripe is not worth 100
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.400]   billion right now it's worth 50
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.440]   billion. But if you mark it down,
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.920]   I don't get my bonus. I'm the
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.280]   person who's giving you money for
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.680]   your next fund. And so when we're
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.960]   assessing, hey, how much are we
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.840]   going to give you for your next
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.560]   fund, we're gonna look at the
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.040]   performance of previous funds. As
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.720]   an indicator,
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.320]   push back on what you just said, I
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.520]   agree with what you just said,
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.720]   except that no one has the
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.920]   explicit conversation. It's an
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.400]   emergent behavior. It's a
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:21.720]   merge.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.880]   The dynamic system. Yeah,
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   show me an incentive. I'll show
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.280]   you an outcome kind of situation.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.120]   But there's no I've never heard
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.280]   of an LP like brow beating GPS to
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.720]   get their marks, right? Like
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.360]   especially on the downside. Never
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.000]   heard of that.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.480]   Ever. Those marks can be done by
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.560]   an audit. Like you said, they
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.000]   could be done by around a
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.200]   financing. And so then there's a
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.000]   secondary market, weird
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   secondary market,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.600]   secondary market can do it. And
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.400]   sometimes LPS have this weird
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.520]   situation where different
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.080]   venture firms are marketing
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.560]   companies at radically different
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.000]   prices. Oh, which creates some
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.320]   interesting dynamics.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.200]   Okay, so I did this series, I did
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.600]   the seed round of stripe where I'm
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.200]   why combinator. And I say, you
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.840]   know what, 50 billions fine, we're
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.880]   going to market at 50 billion
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.520]   because we, we invested at 2
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.400]   million in stripe. But then
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.560]   whoever did the, you know, series
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.640]   G or whatever it's up to, we did
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.920]   the $100 billion mark is like,
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.240]   well, market down to 90. But, you
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.840]   know, somebody CalPERS or Harvard
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.960]   has to has the same share class
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.000]   different funds at two different
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.800]   prices. So then you could really
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.160]   triangulate on reality, huh?
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.000]   Another dynamic that that makes
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   the powder less less dry, that I
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.440]   didn't mention in the tweet storm,
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.400]   imagine you're on your first or
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.960]   second venture fund, or imagine
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.600]   you're a fund that used to just
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.360]   have a one fund, but they've
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.600]   expanded to four funds. Okay, now,
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.760]   imagine you don't have a lot of
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.440]   liquidity proof points on those
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.680]   funds. Do you really want to run
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.600]   out of money and go test whether
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.160]   or not you can raise your third
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.200]   fund or your second fund? Or do
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.080]   you kind of want to wait and see
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.440]   if you can develop some track
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.960]   records so that because you may
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.240]   be facing the imminent death of
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.480]   your firm, if you run out too
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   quickly and and go back to market
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.600]   and there is no market.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.640]   So I have 100 I have $100 million
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.120]   fund, it's my third fund. Okay,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.520]   what pace Am I going to do this,
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.080]   I'm going to do it in 24 months
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.400]   or 18 months like maniacs were
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.960]   doing during the peak, or am I
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.440]   going to take a 36 month approach
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.560]   or more traditional three year
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.720]   deployment, if I even have to
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.520]   take a 40 month deployment, hey,
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.120]   I got time to work out all these
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.600]   issues in the previous portfolio.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.920]   Saks, you've heard this sort of
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.760]   dynamic, what are your thoughts
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.640]   on the dry powder issue? You
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.720]   yourself have a lot of dry
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.400]   powder, I understand. So how do
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:35.960]   you think about it?
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.120]   We do have a lot of dry powder,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.280]   and we're going really slow. I
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.600]   mean, there's no feeling that we
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.520]   have to rush out and deploy this
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.320]   capital. And one of the things
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.480]   that's interesting about the
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.160]   period we've been in, that's been
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.000]   surprising to me is that our
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.440]   metrics actually haven't changed.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.640]   I mean, the the things that we're
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.960]   looking for in a software company
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.320]   haven't really changed, we look
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.040]   for a certain amount of ARR,
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.400]   certain growth rates, or amount of
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.040]   net dollar retention, certain
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.640]   CAC, a certain capital
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.520]   efficiency, that bar hasn't
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.680]   changed for us. But the number of
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.040]   companies meeting that bar has
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.320]   gone down considerably,
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.800]   because they have headwinds
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.040]   because customers are in
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.480]   austerity measures, or companies
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.440]   are going out of business and
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.480]   saying, Hey, let me consolidate
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.200]   my SAS tools,
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.400]   enterprise buyers are sharpening
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.320]   their pencils. They are trying to
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.600]   consolidate vendors. There's a
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.520]   lot of headwinds in the buying
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.240]   cycle right now. Yeah. And it's a
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.400]   little bit like I don't know if
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.440]   you remember in the.com crash 20
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   something years ago.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.680]   Oh, I remember it.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.200]   Yeah. So back in 99 2000, the
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.320]   conventional wisdom was that the
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.840]   company you wanted to be in was
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.840]   Yahoo, because Yahoo was
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.560]   profitable. And when all these
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.120]   startups went out of business,
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.880]   Yahoo would be the way that you
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.720]   could own a piece of the future
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.760]   of the internet, but you wouldn't
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.560]   have to take all the startup
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.800]   risk. And then it turned out that
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.640]   all of Yahoo's revenues went away,
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.240]   because their revenues were
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.760]   coming from banner advertisements
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.160]   bought by startups, which were
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.560]   funded by VC dollars. So when you
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.680]   had the whole.com crash, Yahoo's
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.040]   business dried up. Yep. So then
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.760]   Yahoo lost
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.720]   whatever it was. It turned out, a
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.680]   lot of people weren't wearing
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.360]   swim trunks.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   It was so Yahoo's business was
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.080]   actually highly correlated with
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.880]   startup funding. And I think
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.440]   there's been an aspect of that
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.840]   with a lot of these companies
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.560]   where you would think that
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.320]   they're pretty insulated from the
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.360]   business cycle. Even like
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.200]   especially the enterprise
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.680]   software companies, there's a lot
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.720]   of software companies that were
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   selling to other startups, that
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.640]   was pretty obvious, they're going
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.560]   to be impacted. But even the ones
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.760]   selling to enterprise companies
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.200]   have been affected in subtle ways.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.560]   And there just aren't that many
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.360]   startups right now hitting that
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.640]   same bar that they were hitting
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.680]   just a couple of years ago.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.280]   Freeberg, your thoughts on this
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.440]   LP, GP dynamics and dry pattern?
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.560]   I mean, I think, I mean, one
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.800]   aspect on the same front of VCs
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.680]   being somewhat reticent to deploy
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.840]   more capital, it's flowing
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.520]   through to the LP space and
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.040]   Gurley can probably pint on this
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.200]   or Sac can probably pint on this
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.960]   too. But and all of you guys
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.640]   obviously could, but it's been
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.920]   apparent in the last year that
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.320]   LPs are wondering what do they
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.000]   have? What are these portfolios
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.880]   ultimately really going to be
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.000]   worth? What's the actual cash
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.040]   distributions? And I think
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.360]   there's these new rules, right
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:23.960]   Gurley, where you got to
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.600]   distribute 5% of your assets each
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.320]   year to the institution that
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:28.800]   you're meant to represent.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.680]   Yeah, Bill, expand this, you're
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.960]   an endowment, you're obligated to
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.720]   not just grow your endowment
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   both either from the board of
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.080]   the, like the endowment of the
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.080]   board of trustees of the
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.720]   university, or I think there was
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.560]   a tax provision put in that if
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.680]   you're not distributing 5%,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.000]   then you're exposed to tax on
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.600]   the returns. And so there's a,
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   there's a unquestionable
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.840]   potential issue with LPs around
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.880]   their own liquidity. So they've
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.480]   all followed the Dave Swenson
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.440]   model where they've all got 50%
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.120]   or even more in illiquid assets,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.880]   you move into a cyclical decline,
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.800]   where the number of IPOs and
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.600]   liquidity events both for VCs
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.680]   and PE, remember, PE is way
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.800]   bigger than VCs.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.080]   Private equity.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.200]   Aren't coming. And then the
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.560]   drawdowns keep coming. And so
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.200]   you have to meet the drawdowns.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.360]   You're not getting any
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.080]   liquidity, your constituent
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.480]   needs 5% liquidity.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.760]   And now you got a cash crunch.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.960]   Now you you have cash crunches
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.000]   and LP. And I think GPs are
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.680]   aware of this issue. So, you
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.800]   know, do you want to provoke
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.400]   that or not?
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.920]   Right. So I'll just
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.360]   Maybe you run quick, you run
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.400]   early, or you run late. You
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.080]   don't want to be in the middle.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.160]   So I'll just say like
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.120]   anecdotally, it seems LPs are
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.680]   more reticent. I've heard
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.160]   several folks talk about how
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.680]   they're reducing commitments by
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.360]   50%, two thirds, or in some
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.560]   cases, 100%. Particularly after
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.320]   the mad rush for capital over
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.200]   the last couple of years or
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.280]   capital commitments, I would
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.040]   say for the last couple of
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.120]   years. And so the downstream
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.320]   effect of that ultimately, as
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.160]   the current funds get deployed,
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.040]   there are fewer new funds and
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.560]   less new capital being
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.040]   committed from these LPs into
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.360]   new funds and, you know, fast
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.480]   forward two or three years, and
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.080]   there's going to be less
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.200]   capital available. And so it
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.840]   keeps the bar high. So while
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.080]   this is, you know, and so the
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.360]   bar, I think is only going to
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.720]   get higher over the next couple
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.600]   of years, as that capital cycle
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.400]   moves its way through the
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:33.960]   system.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.280]   It's probably worth explaining
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.160]   what Freeberg was talking about
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.640]   in terms of a commitment. So you
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.800]   may have a, let's just say
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.120]   University X has committed 25
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.320]   million to funds three through
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:52.320]   five for venture fund Z. And now
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.400]   they're saying in the next fund,
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.280]   we're going to be at 10 instead
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.000]   of 25.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.160]   When they say they're making
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.760]   that commitment, that capital
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.200]   gets deployed by the venture
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.680]   investor over the next, on
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.120]   average, call it five years. So
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.960]   the reduction in a commitment
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.560]   this year means that there's
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.520]   less capital to invest over the
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.560]   next three to five years. And so
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.080]   that gets played out as we fast
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.080]   forward, we're, you know, we're
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.680]   still sitting on funds from the
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.360]   last couple of years, as those
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.280]   funds get invested, the new
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.480]   funds are going to be smaller,
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.280]   there's going to be fewer of
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.400]   them, which and that's when the
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.680]   market gets much tighter is in
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   the next couple of years, you
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.600]   know, Brad, this seems like the
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.040]   greatest setup ever. Feels like
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.280]   the setup last year buying
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.440]   equities when everybody was
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.200]   scared. If everybody is
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.640]   tightening their belts, if VC
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.280]   funds are not going to deploy,
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.800]   this feels like the time to be
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.280]   deploying. So maybe you could
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.360]   talk a little bit about this
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.080]   austerity measures coming or
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.600]   just belt tightening or some
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.720]   people may be getting out of the
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.320]   venture business who shouldn't
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.400]   have been in it to begin with.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.520]   All of this seems like a great
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.120]   setup for more discipline and
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.240]   more disciplined founders. If
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.760]   the VCs have to be disciplined,
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.280]   doesn't that trickle down to the
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.200]   portfolio companies?
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.320]   100% but while this might
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.440]   happen, while this might happen,
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.560]   I'm gonna take the other side. I
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.680]   don't think that's what the
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.520]   lived experiences of most VCs in
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.680]   Silicon Valley today on series A
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.440]   series B series C is certainly
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.920]   not in the area we're competing.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.200]   We're seeing four or five $600
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.400]   million deals get done on zero
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.480]   revenue to $3 million in
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.160]   revenue. And so let me just
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.760]   throw out perhaps an alternative
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.400]   view as to why this might look a
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.040]   little different than the world
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.800]   of austerity that we saw in 2002
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.840]   2003 2009 1011. The first is
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.320]   right, the stock market is near
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.920]   an all time high. And we know
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.280]   that, you know, the venture
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.440]   markets are reflexive to the
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.720]   stock market. We talked about
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.720]   that. The second reason which I
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.160]   think is interesting is most
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.520]   firms on average are a lot
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.800]   bigger. Okay, that creates two
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.040]   issues. We have a situation where
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.000]   younger partners and principals
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.320]   who all did deals that were
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.680]   overvalued over the last few
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.520]   years, they want to put some
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.800]   points on the board in a
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.360]   repriced deal because they have
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.600]   to have some winners. So you
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.760]   have this principal agent
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.160]   problem. The people who used to
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.520]   check them were the senior
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.160]   partners, right, the the
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.280]   investment committee, but now
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.680]   they have a lot of mouths to
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.600]   feed. So when you put money to
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.280]   work, you pull down more fee.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   And so you know, these funds now
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.080]   I mean, if you're tiger or some
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.600]   of these big funds, you have
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.800]   giant cost bases that you've
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.760]   created because of the size of
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.520]   the firm that you created. The
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.600]   third is the nature of LPS and
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.520]   Bill mentioned, you know, Dave
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:36.840]   Swenson, in 2002, MIT, Yale,
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.320]   Harvard, they would call you
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.880]   know, who were the early backers
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.920]   of venture firms, they would
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.200]   call these venture guys up and
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.800]   say, Listen, we're hurting,
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.280]   there were a lot of markdowns,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.960]   we need to slow down the pace of
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   deployment, right. And so they
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.400]   were a factor LP said, slow it
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.640]   down. I'm not hearing that out
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.840]   of LPS today. Okay. And I think
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.320]   one of these chains, I certainly
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.960]   am hearing it out of traditional
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.280]   LPS, some family offices, some
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.640]   endowments, but pensions,
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.680]   sovereign wealth funds, etc, who
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.400]   now represent a much bigger
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.360]   percentage of the total capital
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.520]   base of venture, they have money
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.200]   coming out of the ground every
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.680]   day that they need to deploy
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.200]   like they did in private equity.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.840]   And so again, I'm not saying
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.600]   this for certain. And certainly,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.120]   there are more discerning
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.600]   sovereign wealth funds than
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.560]   others who are saying don't
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.200]   speed up the pace of deployment.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.720]   But I'm wondering if that nature
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.280]   that change in the nature of the
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.720]   LP base is also contributing to
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.800]   this, you know, as a sax called
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   AI mania.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.200]   Yeah, I mean, we see it in
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.160]   Hollywood, some new actors come
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.960]   in, they want to build a brand.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.840]   We saw the Russians do it, we
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.760]   saw the Japanese do it. You see
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.200]   China do it, people come in new
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.480]   entrants at the table, they get
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.920]   splashy cashy, they want to place
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.880]   a lot of bets, they want to make
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.360]   a name for subpoena brand. So
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:55.960]   that's an interesting
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.880]   counterpoint. Our entire business,
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.360]   of course, is based on exits, the
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.800]   highest form of exit, I guess, is
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.360]   an IPO, an overpriced acquisition
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.560]   would be the second. And it was a
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.120]   secondary market for shares as a
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.080]   distant third.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.600]   Looks like the IPO window might be
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.360]   cracking open a bit. And some
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.320]   people are being forced the guns
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.440]   to the head arm owned by SoftBank
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.560]   Masayoshi son, looking to raise 10
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.720]   billion had a 50 60 $70 billion
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.360]   valuation could be the largest IPO
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.280]   of the year. instacart looking at
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.720]   a $12 billion valuation, Reddit
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.000]   kind of went dark, they had a
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.560]   couple of problems with their
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.800]   community. But they were in line
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.880]   stripe obviously in line. clavio
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.960]   has got a $5 billion valuation.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.160]   And then we saw a couple of what
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.120]   I'll say are non traditional
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.760]   companies going public something
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.680]   called shark ninja. I saw in
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.440]   public we had a little
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.720]   conversation about this Brad
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.520]   Kirsner, they have a market cap
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.600]   of 4.3 billion, they had a pop of
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.360]   40% of a Greek food chain. They
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.040]   went public and have a market cap
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.680]   of $5 billion. surfair a company
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.920]   I'd passed on investing in but was
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.800]   intrigued by they do Pilatus
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.200]   shuttles between places on the West
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.880]   Coast here little short runs, they
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.520]   did a direct listing in July.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.320]   market cap of 85 million didn't go
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.680]   well. Bill Gurley is the IPO
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.840]   window opening for our people kind
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.880]   of on the ledge who have no choice
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.440]   but to jump and hope for the best
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.760]   one thing we didn't probably spend
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.360]   enough time on in the last topic,
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.120]   which I'll just hit on briefly is
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.360]   the complexity of those unicorns.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.640]   So Brad mentioned I saw a deck that
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.720]   said there were more private
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.960]   unicorns than public tech companies
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.880]   over a billion dollars at one point
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.280]   in time, which is shocking, but
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.680]   the dose, because those companies
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.560]   grew up in the 9920 to 21 timeframe
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:53.720]   where you could raise money at
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.840]   excessive valuation, their cap
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.840]   charts are very complex and rigid.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.680]   They have different lick preferences
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.360]   at different places. And, and, and
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.080]   they've got board members who all
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.840]   have different marks, and are all
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.320]   very worried about whether this
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.040]   thing can get to a certain place or
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.480]   not. And so it's very difficult to
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.440]   come in and do another private round
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.120]   in those situations, you might have
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.560]   to, you might have to put the return
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.080]   in a guaranteed pick dividend IPO or
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.080]   some complex derivative. And a lot
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.680]   of people I think Brad would agree
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.200]   with this, a lot of people just say,
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.880]   they opt out and say, no, this is
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.280]   too hard, I'm not going to go in
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.080]   there and negotiate with five
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.960]   different constituencies on how to
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.400]   do this, you can't just do a simple
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.720]   investment because of that.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.800]   Okay, so it's gotten too complex,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.680]   which then if the buyers of those
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.520]   shares do not want to be involved in
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.040]   that crazy, okay, is Stripe worth
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.280]   we'll just pick Stripe as an example
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   50 billion or 100 billion and the last
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.080]   investors are at 100. Why see in a 2
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:53.640]   million?
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.040]   Maybe a bad example, just because
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.720]   their total lick press stack may
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.600]   still be a fraction of their market
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.800]   cap for a lot of these unicorns, the
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.160]   lick press stack can be very close to
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.320]   their market cap, or their today's
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.600]   valuation. And that's what
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.920]   creates a real structural problem.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   You got a billion dollars in
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.120]   investment in the company and
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.960]   liquidation money that has to come
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.120]   out to pay those investors, but the
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.320]   company is only worth 2 billion or a
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.040]   billion. And now it's
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.720]   Yeah, when you get to that place,
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.520]   sometimes going public is just the
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.360]   easiest way to clean it all up.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.040]   Because everybody converts to
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.600]   common. And we just the company
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.680]   starts trading and reality is
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.640]   reality. It's like kind of like
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.360]   taking the medicine.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.800]   Yeah. And I think that happened. One
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.840]   good example was square at one point
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.800]   had done a derivative financing on
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.200]   top that was somewhat problematic.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.760]   And they just felt like they had to
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.280]   get out. And they did and it cleaned
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.480]   up the cap chart. And one thing I've
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.920]   been waiting on, we'll see if it
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.800]   happens. But because of hyper
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.200]   competition and investing in 99 2020
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.360]   2021. There was a term removed from
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.840]   most term sheets that gave
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.920]   investors the right to protect their
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   lick prep on IPO that's gone in most
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.400]   of these cases. So you could convert
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.040]   lick prep under which for a founder
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.360]   or an early stage angel investor would
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.480]   be a huge win. Got it. Whereas if you
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.520]   sold a company in M&A, the lick prep
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.280]   would play. Does that make sense?
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.080]   Yes. So the last investor comes in,
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.640]   they're getting a multiple of their
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.320]   money back, except in an IPO. Right.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.840]   And the IPO happens, you know, yeah.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.040]   And I suspect most of those late stage
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.120]   investors keep assume that their
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.200]   investment has a debt like floor on
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.000]   lick prep. And if this were to start
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.600]   to happen, or recaps, which can also be
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.680]   done, self self inflicted recaps, I
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.600]   have seen many times, just to get past
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.320]   the structural complexity, either one
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.560]   of those things could wipe out that
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.120]   lick prep.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.800]   So net net, girly, more IPOs are going
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.240]   to happen.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.520]   I think you will see there's two things
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.280]   that I think that complex cleaning up
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.400]   complexity is a great reason for the
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.080]   public market. And Brad already said,
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.600]   we've seen a massive recovery in in
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.480]   software stocks, like the marks are
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.440]   better than they were. Two years ago,
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.040]   so Brad or sacks, just M&A wise, we've
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.480]   seen Lena Khan, we've discussed it many
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.440]   times, seems to be saying all business
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.560]   equals bad, any merger equals bad. She's
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.080]   gonna, you know, attempt to throw cold
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.760]   water on any merger that's happening. So
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.720]   M&A seems to be being taken off the
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.880]   plate by not just Lena Khan, but also
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.880]   the EU is seems to be turning the
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.880]   screws. So if we don't have an M&A
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.480]   market, then that means there's only an
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.080]   IPO market.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.000]   Correct. I mean, that's just another one
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.200]   of the reasons that is pressuring these
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.760]   companies, these companies need to raise
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.560]   capital. So just to double click on what
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.680]   Bill said, and put some numbers around
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.360]   it, right, because we read a lot of
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.440]   stats about how many IPOs there were. So
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.440]   I had the team pull some figures 480
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:09.280]   IPOs, US IPOs in 2020 1035. So a huge
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:15.760]   bubble and 21 181 in 22 and 123. Okay,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.200]   but I think that overstates, right,
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.120]   because we had a lot of SPACs and crappy
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.920]   IPOs. So it really overstates the quality
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.160]   IPOs. So you know, we're one of the major
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.640]   buyers in tech IPOs. So I just went to
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.120]   the team and said, how many IPOs were we
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.000]   tracking? And did we consider
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.320]   participating in during these years? So
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:41.400]   that was 46 in 2020 100 in 2021 3 in
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.800]   2022 and zero year to date in 2023. Okay,
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.040]   don't want to be in the Greek food.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.160]   So what I would say is I just returned
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.880]   from Deer Valley this week where Morgan
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.280]   Stanley is putting on a conference,
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.880]   talking to their big potential IPO buyers.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:59.600]   We are now queued up as you and I we had
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.320]   this tweet exchange Jason this week. And
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.080]   I said, you know, in that exchange, the
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.560]   world's normalized fear of COVID past
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.360]   hyperinflation past etc. First class IPOs
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.120]   are coming and a bunch of down round
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.760]   IPOs are coming. So let me just explain
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.840]   really quickly on that. Right? You
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.400]   mentioned Instacart, right? Super high
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.320]   quality company, I think its last private
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.040]   round was 50 or 60 billion in the bubble.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.920]   And now it's rumored to be going public
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.160]   at somewhere around $10 billion. Okay, so
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.760]   that represents the reset that will have
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.520]   to happen. And as Bill said, if you were a
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.000]   investor in that last round of Instacart,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.680]   and you were buying preferred shares and
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.600]   thought you were protected, that
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.040]   preference is washed, right? So you're
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.920]   going to be down 50 60 70% on those
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.560]   preferred shares, because you're going to
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.720]   be converted into common in that IPO.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.560]   It's the right thing for the company to
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.920]   do. It's the right thing for the
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   investors to do it cleans up the cap
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:58.560]   table. So that is an example of you know,
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.800]   the down round IPOs of high quality
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.240]   companies that you're going to see come
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.080]   public, then you're going to have folks
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.040]   like arm like ByteDance, Databricks
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.520]   would be another one of these I think
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.600]   that you know, sneak that would be more
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.640]   in that Instacart camp, you know, like,
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.800]   there will be some discount relative
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.200]   perhaps to their fully diluted last
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.880]   rounds valuation, but these make no
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.680]   mistake about our high quality companies
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.880]   that will lubricate and Altimeter will
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.280]   compete for those IPOs because these
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.400]   bankers are hell bent on pricing these
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.120]   IPOs at a discount to fair value, they
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.840]   need them to work, they need to bring
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.280]   buyers back into the IPO market because
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.720]   these companies need liquidity.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:40.360]   So suddenly the banks need to get wins
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.840]   for the people buying the shares as
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.240]   opposed to in the past, they were like,
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.160]   yeah, we're just selling a security at
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   the market rate, whatever that famous
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.080]   the famous monologue from what was the
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.600]   movie with was that Jeremy Irons who
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.760]   gives that monologue we're selling
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.440]   securities to informed buyers and that's
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.280]   it is a pretty dark scene.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.240]   So it won't be a light switch, Jason,
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.320]   but I do think margin call margin call.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.760]   Thank you. It was Jeremy Irons.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.400]   I don't think it'll look like a light
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.080]   switch, but it will be I think we're
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.680]   going to see 567 IPOs good size IPOs in
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.800]   q4 will probably see closer to 10 in q1
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.480]   and then it will start opening up in the
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.160]   back half of next year in part because
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.720]   boards of directors will begin to
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.720]   realize you know what, we have to go
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.120]   public if it's down round who cares,
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.840]   it's acceptable. And this is really
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.960]   healthy. We need these companies and by
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.040]   the way, I'm in the Bill Gurley camp,
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.080]   you should not stay private forever, you
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.640]   should get your company if you have 100
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.680]   or 200 million in revenue, get your
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.680]   company public innovate and grow in the
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.280]   public markets with the discipline and
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.240]   cadence of the public markets. And if
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.200]   it's if it's a you should expect the
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.880]   prices lower because the world was out
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.440]   of their mind in 2021 and multiples of
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:52.960]   reset.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.400]   Saks you shared a news story with me
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.840]   just about some of the incredible
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.600]   returns in the golden hour of venture
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.760]   capital, Washington University, Duke
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.400]   University, some of these endowments
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.920]   just exploded in value.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.520]   Yeah, I remember when this article came
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.360]   out, it was September 29 2021. Less than
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   two years ago. Yeah, we were all feeling
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.320]   really good about our industry. Yeah. But
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.720]   as it turns out, the whole thing was
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.760]   inflated by all the free money that the
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.640]   Fed had airdropped. So you know, the
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.840]   public markets were really frothy. That
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.560]   was basically very bubbly, especially for
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.880]   gross stocks. You had all these new IPOs
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   and SPACs and so forth, and they were
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.400]   super bubbly. And the result was that the
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.560]   returns both realized returns and on
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.480]   paper for these endowments were massive.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.800]   So if you think about the LP, the LP
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.640]   community, if they're making commitments
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.600]   in 2021, the way they do that is they
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.040]   look at the total value of their
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.040]   endowments, and then they allocate a
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.800]   certain percentage by asset class. So
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.440]   they'll allocate a certain percentage to
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.320]   public markets, certain percentage to
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.960]   real estate, private equity, and then VC.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.480]   So if the overall value of the
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.520]   endowment is really big, then that
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.800]   percentage that goes to VC is gonna be
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.080]   really big too. And then what happened is
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.800]   you had this huge correction over the
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.840]   next couple of years. And so one of the
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.320]   things we heard from the LP community
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.160]   last year is a problem they called the
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.800]   denominator effect.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   Explain.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.080]   Well, the value of their portfolios had
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.560]   gone down a lot because the public
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.520]   markets were down, what was it, something
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.440]   like 50% in some cases, yeah, for gross
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.560]   stocks and like 15, 20% for the entire
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.880]   market. So the value of the portfolio was
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.840]   down, but the venture capital part of
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.640]   that was not down both because of the
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.720]   lag in getting fresh marks. And then
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.840]   also because they had already made
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.640]   commitments to new VC funds at the peak
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.880]   of the market. So all of a sudden, the
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.080]   percentage of their portfolio that was
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.320]   VC related, roughly doubled. And so
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.240]   that's why all of a sudden, the LP
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.200]   commitments have dried up is because
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.800]   they're over allocated to VC. Yeah. Now,
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.760]   as the public markets have come back
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.400]   this year, then that problem mitigates
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.160]   to some degree. But yes, I think it's
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.040]   still out there. And I think this is why
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.800]   you're seeing certainly domestic LPs
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.640]   really slow their allocations to venture
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.080]   capitals, they still have the denominator
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.880]   problem. Now, I think that's less of an
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.200]   issue overseas. I think Jake, how you
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.400]   observe that the the four seasons of the
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.920]   bar at the Dubai
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.080]   Abu Dhabi bar looks like a rosewood to
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.600]   Braddock. We were there. I literally got
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   stopped four times from the elevator to
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.960]   the front door. I am not kidding. Four
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.600]   people stopped me. That's two more than
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.080]   would stop me at the rosewood going to
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.360]   the front door. It was
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.200]   bonkers. You should recognize that as a
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.400]   hyper attractor for where available money
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:58.080]   was, yes, relative to the US dollars and
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.520]   whether they were available. Yeah, I
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.160]   think we're in for a period here of just
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   continued distress and pain, even though
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.640]   the market is sort of normalized or
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.960]   stabilized. Now, again, I just think we've
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.160]   been in a huge software recession for the
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.800]   last year. Yeah, I think that it's been
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.280]   masked by the fact that the rest of the
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.640]   economy seems to be okay. But this is the
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.560]   worst software recession we've been in, I
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.200]   think, since the dot com crash. I mean,
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.280]   the buyers have been laying off employees
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.440]   by the thousands. And since software is
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.400]   bought on a per seat basis, yeah, the
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.800]   market has really condensed. We had one
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.840]   startup that was selling to Twitter, and
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.640]   they got a renewal. And I think their
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.680]   contract was 80% off because he was laid
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.640]   off 80% of the employees. Yeah. And I
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.360]   told him that before negotiating the last
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.600]   20%, which you could negotiate 50% off
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.680]   that. I told him they did a great job is
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.440]   getting that 20% because he wants to
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.440]   everything. Yeah, I was really impressed.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.360]   They were able to renew at 20% of last
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.760]   year's value. You know what we had a
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.960]   vendor, we had a vendor, and this vendor
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.320]   went on for far too long. And you know
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.800]   what, if you go out, you know, two, three
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.480]   nights in a row until four or five in the
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.440]   morning, that next week is going to be
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.880]   painful and suffering. That's what the
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.200]   industry is going through. It's just
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.120]   going to take a lot of cold plunges and
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.760]   infrared and pickleball and to feel good
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.080]   again,
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.640]   this thing I would like in written
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.600]   retrospect that I think super interesting
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.360]   about the venture capital cycle. One, I
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.400]   think it's inherently cyclical. And it's
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.560]   always going to be that way, unless we
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.280]   fundamentally change the structure of the
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.680]   industry. Because it just invites
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.600]   competition, and there's no barriers to
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.880]   entry. But I went and talked to some LPs
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.120]   that have been in the business for a
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.360]   very long period of time. And a vast
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.080]   majority of the reason venture outperforms
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.720]   other asset classes has to do with these
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.640]   tiny windows when you have a super
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.920]   prodding market. And if you don't, if you
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.640]   aren't around for that part, you know, if
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.560]   you strip those years out of a 40 year
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.440]   assessment, it's actually not that
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.400]   interesting an asset class, which
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.200]   highlights the need for venture funds to
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.200]   get liquidity at the peak. Yes, right when
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.240]   we are at the peak is when people get the
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.400]   most brazen, the most confident and they
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.880]   start talking about how we're going to
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.880]   hold forever. And so you had venture
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.320]   firms with the biggest positions they've
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.760]   ever had in their entire life, go over
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.520]   the waterfall, and, and basically
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.760]   evaporate what could have been returned.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.160]   Yeah, I mean, diamond diamond hands can
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.200]   come back and bite you. And you've said
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.040]   famously, you can't what was the line
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.840]   you had? You can't eat IRR? Well, you
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.000]   can't. I don't think I said it, but it's
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.240]   been said. Yeah. Since we're on our movie
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.160]   bender here. For those of you haven't
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.480]   seen margin call. Just one of the great
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:48.800]   scenes.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.360]   This is the best scene. The whole scene,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.880]   by the way, it's like the best scene. I
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.000]   think of modern finance films. So look at
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   this murderous.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.040]   Who are we selling this to?
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.160]   Same people we've been selling it to
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.200]   for the last two years and whoever else
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:02.720]   will buy it.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.640]   But john, if you do this, you will kill
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.600]   the market for years. It's over. And
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.400]   you're selling something that you know
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.320]   has no value.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.040]   We are selling to willing buyers of the
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.880]   current fair market price so that we may
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.040]   survive.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:28.280]   You can rationalize a lot on Wall Street,
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:28.520]   man.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:32.000]   But yeah, but what Bill's saying is that
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.640]   the opposite took place, which is VCs
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.280]   drink the Kool Aid and didn't sell when
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.880]   that we're at the peak of the market.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.280]   They also got caught up in a competition
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.840]   of trying to, to appeal to the founder
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.520]   community is saying, Hey, we're in it
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.120]   forever. We're going to hold forever.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.640]   We're your best friend forever.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.040]   But Bill, there was also this element
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.680]   that drove that strategic rationale,
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.680]   this data set, which is the best
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.440]   performers in tech generated most of
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.120]   the value after they went public.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.960]   I mean, you know, there's a trillion
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   dollars of market value generated in
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.120]   NVIDIA, in Apple, in Google, in Amazon,
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.440]   all over the many years post going
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.960]   public. And you know, if you read
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.200]   Sequoia's notes when they kind of made
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.080]   the transition that they made, they
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.360]   said, we don't want to, you know, walk
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.720]   away from the power law that the power
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.880]   law continues to accumulate and accrue
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.600]   even in the public markets. And we
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.880]   want to continue to participate in
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.440]   that because there's another 100 X
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.520]   upside coming from here in the ones
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.880]   that we select, we want to stay with
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.040]   not necessarily we're going to stay
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.360]   in all of them. You have to be
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.720]   determined. There are some that we
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.040]   believe are still 100 X upside from
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.120]   here. And just because there's an IPO
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.280]   doesn't mean that we want to exit the
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.520]   position that there's now more capital
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.560]   available to them more public currency
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.400]   they can use to do transactions to
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.440]   hire etc. And we want to participate
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.200]   in that value creation.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.120]   The last double could be the biggest
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.440]   right bill.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.320]   I think the total number of companies
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.640]   that meet that criteria in the history
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.560]   of the venture industry is like 10 or
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   15. And yes, and you named many of
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.160]   them. And the problem is that the
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.640]   rhetoric becomes common narrative and
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.080]   becomes part of the ethos of the firm.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.160]   And people want to apply it to every
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.600]   single company, everything. That's
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.440]   right, right. Totally. And that's not
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:18.720]   true.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.200]   I don't want to get too specific here.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.520]   But you had a company you had, you
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.800]   might do have some, let's say, seasoned
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.600]   vets, yourself included bill who when
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.520]   given the opportunity to get liquidity
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.960]   on an incredible investment will do so
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.520]   Fred Wilson sold I think all of coin
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.560]   base when it goes public, he just
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.960]   clears the position when things go
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.960]   public. That's been his philosophy,
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.840]   kind of the antithesis of what's a
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.000]   coin rule offer are doing with some of
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.040]   their holdings. And then we've seen, we
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.200]   work has an existential crisis, they
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.480]   don't think this might be a viable
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.320]   investment concern anymore. But
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.760]   famously benchmark was able to sell
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.840]   shares at a very high valuation at some
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.360]   point and lock in an incredible return.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:12.560]   Okay, there it is. Yes. Okay. So let me
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.680]   ask you a question, Bill about getting
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.120]   older.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.240]   Well, let me ask the question.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.760]   Let me ask you a question about getting
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.440]   older and wiser.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.600]   Well, Sax, go ahead.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.560]   Sax, like, Freebird wants to be the
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.760]   17th best moderator go
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.640]   sex, you have an investment in SpaceX,
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.960]   right? I mean, there's been a lot of
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.600]   secondary action in SpaceX. Why would
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.720]   you not sell SpaceX at this valuation
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.040]   today? Or maybe did he? As you kind of
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:33.800]   think about this? Yeah,
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.120]   I think we're gonna wait till the
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.680]   company IPOs. I think that would be our
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.160]   default
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.040]   when it goes public sex. Do you then
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.520]   think what's the upside from here? Or
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.600]   do you think my job is done?
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.720]   I think my job is done. Yeah, I think
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.400]   my job is done. I think what we do is
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.720]   just distribute the shares and then
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.480]   each LP can make their own decision
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.840]   about whether they want to hold it or
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.680]   not. And you have one of the nice
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.840]   things you want to do with your share.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.360]   Yeah, yeah. One of the nice things
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.440]   about distributions is that nobody has
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.840]   to sell. So everyone can make their own
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.480]   decision about whether to hold or not.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.440]   Yeah, once the company is public, and
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.920]   the public has all the information
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.960]   through disclosures, the odds that I
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.000]   know something special that a seasoned
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.360]   public market investor doesn't, is
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.200]   probably pretty low.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.400]   I mean, the great paradox of what we
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.080]   all do. And Brad, you have both a public
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.160]   and a private portfolio. I started
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.160]   trading public market equities to get
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.680]   better at my private behavior, Bill,
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.080]   you've done that forever, is public
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.280]   markets, you can't trade on inside
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.360]   information, private companies, that's
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.080]   all you're trading on. Maybe you could
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.760]   speak to a little bit about being what
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.840]   do they call it when you do both
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.320]   crossover investors that make you a
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.320]   crossover investors at the proper term?
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.640]   Well, Bill Gurley is the original
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.440]   crossover investor. He's been trading
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.600]   public stocks since you know, and he'd
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.000]   been doing that research. Yeah,
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.960]   researching him, you know, but you know,
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.400]   the fact of the matter as has Warren
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.000]   Buffett, and you know, who would laugh
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.560]   at the idea of a crossover fund, he's
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.960]   been running one of the world's largest
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.040]   public portfolios and private portfolios
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.880]   forever, he would say I invest in great
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.960]   companies that are mispriced. There are
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.880]   moments in the market cycle, where late
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.000]   stage venture is mispriced to the
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.920]   downside. And there are moments in the
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.880]   cycle where the public markets are
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.200]   mispriced to the downside. What we saw
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.960]   in 2021 is the private markets were
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.400]   crazily overvalued. In 2022, we had this
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.000]   massive correction in the public
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.040]   markets. We believed that they overshot
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.680]   in part, we believe that because we
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.840]   didn't think we're going to have
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.600]   hyperinflation forever, etc. And so you
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.600]   and I invested in, you know, meta and a
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.160]   lot of other things that were on their
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.280]   ass. You've got to buy in the public
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.440]   market when there's blood in the
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.440]   streets, right? As as war as Buffett says,
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.800]   buy when there's blood in the streets
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.200]   and sell when there's trumpets in the
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.520]   air. And you know, there are definitely
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.320]   blood in the streets when you saw things
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.440]   down 60 7080 90%
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.240]   is it Trumpets now does it feel like
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.920]   trumpets to you now or does it feel like
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.320]   trumpets next quarter or the quarter
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.560]   after? If you feel like people are
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.080]   polishing those trumpets right now?
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.320]   Yeah, I mean, a lot of it obviously
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.960]   depends on your view on what's going to
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.840]   happen in the economy fundamentally, and
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.240]   I'm happy to shift to that. But what I
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.920]   would say is this, remember the chart
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.120]   that I've showed many times about
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.320]   software internet valuations, we were,
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.040]   you know, 70% above normal, and then we
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.080]   were 30% below normal. And now we're
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.160]   closer to the trailing 10 year average
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.080]   of internet and software valuations.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.080]   There are always outliers on both sides
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.960]   of this. But I would say a lot of the
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.480]   positive arbitrage that we saw in 22
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.920]   has been squeezed out of the public
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.040]   markets, and we're close to fair value.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.280]   So now if you want to generate alpha,
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.080]   this is going to be about picking
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.040]   individual winners versus individual
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.520]   losers. This is going to you know, like
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.840]   the beta trade on on global macro, I
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.800]   think has largely played out, you know,
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.600]   the catch up back to kind of fair value.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.640]   And now I think there's a debate between
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.800]   kind of hard landing soft landing, are
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.040]   we going to have a reacceleration
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.720]   inflation or not have a reacceleration
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.520]   where you come down on these major
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   issues, I think dictates whether or not,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.200]   you know, now's a good time for us now.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.840]   Can I correct something you said, J.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.000]   Kell? Yeah, please. All right. So you
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.520]   said that public markets inside
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.000]   information isn't allowed, whereas
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.200]   private markets, it's all inside
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.120]   information. I think that could give
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.920]   viewers a misleading impression of what
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:29.760]   we do as VCs. Okay, the way that around
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.560]   typically comes together, it's not like
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.920]   we get tipped off by some insider at the
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.560]   company, in some nefarious way. What
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.680]   happens is that the company chooses to
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.440]   engage with us, or a select number of
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.720]   firms in a process, and then gives us
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.200]   their metrics. And you know, it gives us
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.400]   the business plan, it gives us the
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.840]   forecast. And it's all done in a very
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.320]   above board way. It's not like we're
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.280]   being tipped. However, the part of it
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.520]   that I guess, is true is that a private
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.120]   company does not necessarily engage
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.560]   with everyone in the world.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.920]   Yeah, they don't put on a website, a
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.520]   quarterly report and say, here's what
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.880]   our revenue and our costs were. And
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.200]   here's our earnings, although some
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.120]   private companies do start that process.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.720]   Like by and large, by and large, they
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.400]   buy in large, they're selective about
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.640]   who they want to be on their cap table.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.160]   And that's the big difference and who
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.160]   they want to share in private, a public
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.880]   company doesn't care who's on his cap
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.320]   table, it doesn't really know who's got,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.480]   you know, Apple doesn't know every
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.600]   shareholder and who's got an account set
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:35.000]   E trade or whatever, Charles Schwab, I
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.120]   mean, they may care who their biggest
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.600]   shareholders are, but they don't care
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.560]   who the average shareholder is. Whereas
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.240]   a private company really does care. And
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.600]   part of the reason why they care is
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.720]   because these startups are highly risky.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:50.120]   And they want to have investors who have
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.600]   a track record of behavior where they
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.880]   don't have to worry about being lose
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.480]   every time something doesn't work out,
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.160]   which is most of the time. So I think
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.720]   there's good reasons why startups want
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.120]   to control who their investors are. By
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.520]   the way, there's also the issue of value
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.840]   ad, right? I mean, other things being
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.280]   equal, founders and startups would
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.160]   rather have investors who can help them,
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.960]   as opposed to simply, you know, john Q
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.400]   public.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.080]   Yeah, I mean, you mentioned Boltoners,
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.920]   you don't want somebody who's a neophyte
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.280]   who's going to cause chaos and be upset
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.960]   when revenue goes down, or things are
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.600]   swinging up and down. And yeah, if
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.160]   you're public, yeah, buy the share if
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.360]   you want or sell the share if you want
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.240]   it's a marketplace.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.280]   Sorry, just pull up this this image I
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.160]   just posted. This is from you know, you
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.760]   guys know go cool Roger on
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.520]   Google is a great human. We used to
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.800]   work together at Google. Then he worked
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.480]   with jack at square. He's a door dash
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.120]   today. And he was a leader at Facebook
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.920]   after Google. But he did this tweet last
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.400]   month, any tech venture investor who
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.480]   compares their funds return to the SMP
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.360]   is being naive or disingenuous. The
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.200]   correct index to compare to is the QQ
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.280]   Q, you know, the NASDAQ composite and
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.240]   its performance has been mind boggling.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.480]   And as you can see here, over a 20 year
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.880]   investment period, if you basically just
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.800]   buy the top 10 public tech stocks, and
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.280]   at the end of each year rebalance to the
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.560]   top 10 at the end of the year, your
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.200]   multiple over that period of time is 24
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.880]   x over 10 years. Yeah, and over a 10
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.480]   year period,
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.840]   there's quite a bit of hindsight bias
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.120]   here and saying, well, you look at the
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.720]   top 10, right? It's like,
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.880]   or how the hell do you determine? You
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.240]   know,
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.160]   why not top 100? I mean, are you
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.760]   willing to say that for the next 10
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.760]   years, that you should only buy the top
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.320]   10? What if over the next 10 years, it's
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.680]   more of the field versus the top 10?
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.120]   You know, the next five? Yeah, I think
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.520]   comparing VC as an asset class to the
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.720]   NASDAQ makes a lot of sense. Yes, I
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.600]   think that's fair.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.520]   Yeah. And that's that's the second
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.760]   column from the right, which is
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.800]   basically, you would be a 5.2 x over 10
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.840]   years. So if you're not beating 5.2 x,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.440]   which is a totally liquid investment,
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.200]   if you just bought the QQQ index,
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.640]   what this shows is Apple, Google,
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.120]   Facebook, and Amazon have had an
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:16.640]   immense
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.280]   run up. Well, that's not that's not
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.080]   true. That's, that's actually not true,
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.480]   J. Cal, because if you look at just the
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.640]   static, it doesn't, you know,
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.720]   outperform, it's the rebalance that
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.920]   outperforms, which is whoever's winning
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.320]   in the market, meaning whoever's gaining
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.760]   market value each year, is he then
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.560]   you know, double down your dollars into
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.640]   for next year. And that's changed over a
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.160]   20 year cycle over 10 year cycle. And it
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.960]   really starts to play out over time. But
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.080]   I mean, yeah, if you just look at the
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.400]   QQQ, that's the benchmark as an
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.440]   investor, as a private investor, and you
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.920]   know, go calls comment in his, in his
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.320]   tweet, is that, you know, if they can
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.120]   return, call it seven to eight x over 10
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.520]   years, or in this case, five x over 10
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.160]   years, you could argue that a venture
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.320]   fund needs to return a significant
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.280]   premium, probably a 25 30% premium due
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.320]   to the liquidity and the riskiness of
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.000]   the investment cycle there, whereas the
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.880]   QQQ, you can just sell anytime you want.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.840]   So you know, call it a you know, you
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.440]   need to kind of be demonstrating a 30%
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.360]   premium to the 5.2 x 10 year, which is
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.760]   six and a half seven x called seven x
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.480]   cash on cash.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.120]   I mean, according to this, the venture
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.640]   asset class is super overfunded. So why
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.560]   why is that then?
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.400]   Gurley, do you have a point of view?
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.280]   Yeah, I mean, it would be completely
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.520]   speculative. But I do think if you look
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.720]   at the structure of endowments, you know,
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.600]   you've you've had a few people really
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.040]   leading the way in terms of a playbook
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.320]   with Swenson, you know, Dave Swenson,
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.760]   who passed away recently, but but
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.240]   Dave Swenson, he was a Yale guy. He ran
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.880]   Yale's endowment and is considered
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.160]   and I think, you know, the vast majority
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.800]   of people decided they were going to
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.640]   follow that playbook, which had a, you
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.200]   know, oversized investment in illiquid
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.880]   assets, PV, venture, real estate,
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.400]   commodities, those kind of things. And I
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.760]   think it led to just a massive, like, and
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.400]   these things take forever to figure out
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.280]   if they're right or not. If your
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.520]   portfolio is over 50% illiquid, like who
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.160]   knows what's right and what's wrong. You
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.520]   could do a re you know, you could, there
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.480]   were years where Yale was printing like
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.200]   27% a year. And then in one reset, no
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.480]   nine, wiped out, you know, a ton of that.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.440]   So it's super hard to know. But But I
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:38.520]   do think that philosophy became broadly
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.080]   adopted.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.920]   Yeah, well, look at, can you pull up
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.880]   this chart real quick. This chart from
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.920]   statistics that is value of venture
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.640]   capital investment in the US from 2006
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.280]   to 2022. And what you see is there's
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.720]   there's basically a few different levels
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.400]   before 2014. Call it the industry was
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.800]   basically a $50 billion a year industry
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.440]   in terms of deployments. Then you had a
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.840]   run up where for several years, it was
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.360]   around 100 billion. And then in the
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.200]   pre pandemic years 2018 1920 was around
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.640]   150 billion a year of deployment. And
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.040]   then it went totally nuts. In 2021, it
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.200]   was 350 billion started to come down in
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.880]   2022 to about 250 billion. I think where
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.040]   we are right now is kind of at that
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.320]   2019 level of about 150 billion a year.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.400]   The question is like what it should be. I
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.600]   mean, should this be 150 billion a year
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.920]   industry? Should this be 100 billion a
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.680]   year industry? Should this be a $50
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.040]   billion a year industry?
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.200]   So yeah, it sounds like 100 to 150 would
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.960]   would have been the steady state and
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   Bill some portion of this is stay private
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.400]   longer having an impact where those last
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.480]   couple of rounds were the big, huge juicy
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.320]   rounds. And if people had gone public in
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:00.200]   year 789, like Microsoft, Google, not
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.800]   Google, but Microsoft, and I mean, Google
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.440]   went, what year was Google when it went
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.000]   out eight? You know, going out a little
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.680]   bit earlier, would have chopped off some
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.640]   percentage of this growing.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.480]   Yeah, and I do think one of the most
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.240]   interesting things to watch is going to
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.960]   be how these 1000 unicorns private
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.000]   unicorns play out because not only do
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.080]   they have the cap structure problem, but
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.400]   they lived and grew up in a day and age
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.440]   where they were told growth at all costs.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.840]   And it's super hard culturally, to go
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.440]   from that type of execution to the
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.480]   principal type execution you guys have
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.640]   been promoting over the past several
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.680]   months. It's just hard. It's not
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.280]   impossible, but it's very, very
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.000]   Google went public in year six.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.240]   Yeah, that's 23 million of total venture
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.840]   raised, I think prior to IPO.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.440]   Think about what that means if a lot of
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:53.120]   those unicorns are fake, what does that
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.680]   say about innovation in the American
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.280]   economy, we had this narrative over the
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.080]   last decade that the pace of innovation
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.040]   had fundamentally increased because of
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.160]   the availability of tools and technology.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.960]   And so you had a lot more unicorns being
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:09.040]   created. I mean, I remember back in, I
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.120]   don't know, like, a decade ago, or 2010
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.480]   era, let's say, you know, there were
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.640]   maybe was like 20 to 50 unicorns a year,
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.360]   maybe 20 unicorns a year,
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.520]   there were arguably 10 to 20 girly, great
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.240]   companies formed a year in Silicon Valley
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.560]   or in the tech industry in the West.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:33.960]   I remember when Andreessen kind of gave
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.680]   this this talk about it, maybe a dozen
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.240]   years ago, he said the number was 17.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.440]   There's like 17 important companies
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.800]   created every year in Silicon Valley,
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.320]   and your goal is VC is to be in one of
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.720]   those 17, then all of a sudden we had,
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.800]   was it like 100 200 300 unicorns a year?
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.080]   Yeah, I mean, if you answer the
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.320]   question, how many of them are real?
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.920]   Well, I mean, Brad was just talking
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.840]   about that you're giving a 50 x
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.360]   multiple 50 times top line, I'm not
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360]   talking about earnings, folks, I'm
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.880]   talking about top line, if you give 50 x
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.720]   to every company, then you only need
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.880]   $20 million in revenue to be a unicorn.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.760]   And that's unrealistic when compared to
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.840]   the public markets where things are
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.400]   trading at five times top line and 20
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.880]   times earnings of its high growth,
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.120]   right? So it's just a different market.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.440]   All right. There's a major slowdown in
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.600]   China. Or we could talk about Port
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.520]   Noye and
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.040]   buy. Let's do markets. Just real
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.120]   quick. I've spent a lot of time on the
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.480]   island of Maui. I think it's really sad.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.160]   I don't know if you guys ever been to
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.440]   Lahaina the whole town.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.880]   Beautiful town. So sad. Yeah,
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.520]   it's gone. I just wanted to make sure
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.240]   that we mentioned it because it's
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.320]   hard to depressing what happened. I
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.120]   don't know if you guys have seen the
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:43.720]   wildfires.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.640]   But I mean, sacks in our families, we
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:48.520]   all went to that area from vacation.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.600]   My favorite. Remember that sacks?
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.640]   Yeah, now he's my favorite code 13.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.600]   Yeah, yeah. I mean, now he's my favorite
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.000]   place on earth. Then a line of so many
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.280]   times. It's super sad what happened. I
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:57.760]   just want to
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.960]   hope it's a beautiful town on the water
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960]   with those old buildings and porches
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.840]   gorgeous. And it's just all gone right
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.920]   now. So yeah, this global warming thing
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.520]   and these fires and wind, man, what a
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.320]   hot summer. I mean, we could do a whole
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.480]   southern Iran. Check this out. The
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.000]   temperature hit 155 degrees. It is nine
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.680]   degrees warmer than it's ever been off
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.040]   the west coast of the United States
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.600]   right now. There was 90 degree ocean
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.440]   temperatures off of the Florida coast.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.160]   The sea surface temperature in the
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.600]   North Atlantic is the highest it's ever
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.920]   been by I think seven
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.760]   warming or is it all a hoax?
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:39.360]   Look, the people want to debate all day
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.880]   long about anthropogenic
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.960]   I'm asking you, I'm telling you with
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.000]   like absolute certainty that data right
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.760]   now is on fucking believable. How hot
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.280]   and how dangerous the earth is becoming.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.160]   And we're seeing not just the fire in
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.400]   Maui, the sea surface temperature, which
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.360]   increases the probability of severe
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.120]   tropical storms and hurricanes in the
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.360]   coming season. It's on on on level. You
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:08.880]   know, I got in Saudi Arabia in Dubai,
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.120]   130 degree temperature 95 degree
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.440]   overnight lows. There is you don't have
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.840]   air conditioning, you will die in a lot
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.880]   of these places. So there are parts of
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   the earth where people cannot afford the
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.880]   amenities and the luxuries that we have.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.200]   So is it a world that we all just just
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.720]   say there is no hoax. There is no hope.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.560]   I'm trying to be a softball right in
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.160]   front of you. The earth is warming. The
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.080]   amount of extreme weather is increasing.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.680]   The significant effect of that is
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.040]   becoming apparent. And, you know, it's
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.120]   we could debate for hours about what
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.040]   quote, can you do about it. But there's
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.960]   just a series of really awful things
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.120]   happening right now. And it's becoming
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.560]   more frequent and more apparent that
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.840]   this is a pretty serious thing that
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.240]   we're all in the midst of.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.000]   All you have to do girlies follow what
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.680]   you're doing down there in Texas, which
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.920]   has is it the highest renewable energy
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.280]   percentage of any state now is Texas
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.320]   greater than California. So one of the
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.720]   biggest success stories I saw some
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.360]   politician from Texas saying we got we
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.160]   got to get off all these
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.280]   renewables. There's no silver bullet. If
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.640]   you want to talk about the you know, the
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.640]   fundamental challenge that we all face
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.080]   in terms of whether atmospheric carbon
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.680]   is driving heating or not, if you if you
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.400]   follow that track, there is no silver
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.960]   bullet, there is a lot of things that
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.560]   have to go right in a coordinated way.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.920]   And there are market incentives that
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.920]   make it very difficult for any of those
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.080]   things to actually get done all the way
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:32.440]   through.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.160]   But renewable energy and nuclear
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.920]   you would say are important to have the
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.000]   most important. Yeah, there's still
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.800]   industrial production. I mean, it's just
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.880]   like you the list goes on. You know,
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.520]   systems and agriculture. There's a lot
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.520]   of players. What's the clearest path? I
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.960]   mean, if you had to, if you said, hey,
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.440]   put 90% of your effort on these three
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.960]   things, it would be nuclear renewables,
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.840]   painting people's roofs with white paint
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.120]   like this new paint that's reflect stuff.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.800]   I mean, what would be in your shortlist?
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.080]   That's not going to change much. No,
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.560]   let's see this conversation. Other time.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.920]   We've got Brad and Bill here. I think
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:07.960]   let's honestly, I'd love to have this
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.360]   conversation. We should do it on the
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.800]   dock. Yeah, next week, we'll do a big
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.360]   thing here. Yeah. So just wrapping up
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.640]   here on sort of macro, we'll give you a
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   little macro. Brad, CPI seems like it's
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.160]   measured and consumers seem like they're
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.840]   running out of money and starting to
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.600]   tighten their belts. Unemployment, still
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.440]   all time low, still 9 million job
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.240]   openings. Feels like this is the steady
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.840]   state for the next year. Or do you think
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.360]   hard landing, no landing, soft landing?
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.360]   Well, maybe they can bring up the first
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.320]   chart. This morning we had CPI reported
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.760]   we had the smallest back to back monthly
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.720]   gains in core CPI in over two years, back
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.160]   to point 2% annualizing just over over 2%
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.480]   now. So on a year over year basis, it was
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.520]   3.2%. Now remember, it was only six months
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.920]   ago that people were still hyper
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.320]   ventilating about, you know, this 9.1% we
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.280]   saw last year that everybody on this pod,
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.400]   I think, was largely an agreement that
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.880]   was COVID stimulated. But you know, the
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.200]   blue line here represents the consensus
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.960]   estimates of folks like Goldman Sachs,
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.640]   right, which is pretty similar to what
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.960]   the Fed's own estimates are. If you go to
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.440]   the next slide here, Nick, this is what
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.800]   people, the current market is betting
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.480]   will happen to the Fed funds rate. So the
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.480]   market is saying, like, you know, you've
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.280]   heard Chamath say many times higher for
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.920]   longer, I happen to think we'll have
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.880]   higher rates for longer too. But the
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.680]   market is saying we're worried about an
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.600]   economic slowdown that's going to force
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.640]   the Fed's hand. So the market is betting
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.480]   that the Fed funds rate will come down,
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.080]   either because inflation continues to
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.680]   roll, or because the economy continues to
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.360]   slow. And so this third slide, which I
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.000]   think is a really interesting one, which
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.880]   which nobody really talks about, but this
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.480]   is the reason I think Druckenmiller and
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.600]   other are worried about recession.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.880]   There's a measure by the San Francisco
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.320]   Fed, which is called the effective funds
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.240]   proxy rate. Okay, so this is not the Fed
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.320]   funds rate. This is what they say the
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.840]   total impact of quantitative tightening
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.200]   plus rate hikes are. And we're now back
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.560]   to the highest level on that proxy rate,
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.960]   since we've been since May of 2000. It's
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.760]   up over 7%. I think that's the reason
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.360]   people are looking at this blue line up
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.840]   over 7%. That's the highest effective
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.600]   rate calculated by the San Francisco Fed
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.320]   since all the way back to May 2000. And
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.360]   this is the concern.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.000]   Brett, could you just explain that? Why
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.120]   is the effective rate 3% higher than the
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:42.960]   official rate?
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.800]   Because of quantitative tightening,
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.680]   because there's a lot of other things
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.000]   going on in the economy, the impacts
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.880]   interest rates, the rate at which you can
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.800]   borrow part of it is there's just less
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:54.920]   money in the system.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.720]   It's a credit crunch, basically,
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.800]   exactly. Just because the rates 4%
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.080]   doesn't mean you can get out. You can't
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.960]   borrow, nobody can borrow at the 10 year
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.920]   rate. Okay, so if you're a company or an
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.280]   individual, and you want to go borrow,
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.440]   you have to buy it at a much higher rate.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.800]   So that is where the rubber meets the
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.280]   road. If you're trying to borrow to buy a
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.080]   house, borrow to buy a car borrow to
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.600]   expand your business, that the blue line
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.120]   represents a much better, you know,
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.520]   calibration for the level of tightening
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.480]   in the economy. So there is a very strong
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.400]   debate. And I would say the markets
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.720]   actually betting here that the Fed is
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.360]   overdoing it, because of what you see in
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.400]   that blue line, and that the economy is
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.720]   going to slow the lag effects of this
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.040]   tightening have not yet been felt. And so
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.640]   this gets back to the question we had
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.120]   before, which is where are we in the
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.400]   cycle, whether or not we're going to
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.880]   continue to have growth now really
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.560]   interesting, Jason, Bloomberg's headline
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.240]   today was the summer of disinflation. And
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.400]   we said on this pod six months ago, we
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.040]   said it's more likely by the end of 2023,
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.160]   we're going to be talking about
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.880]   disinflation than inflation. And lo and
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.200]   behold, not only are not only are we
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.480]   seeing signs of disinflation air tickets
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.600]   down 18% year over year, but China just
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.560]   posted actual disinflation. Yeah, right.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.560]   So prices are coming down. People are
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:14.920]   going to be surprised that there's more
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.520]   products or services available at lower
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.040]   prices, which then could affect the
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.920]   salaries, because hey, we're not making
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.120]   as much money at this company, we got to
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.600]   cut salaries. I mean, we know that the Fed
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.360]   at the start of COVID was more like the
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.280]   the curses of disinflation are almost
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.920]   bigger than the curses of inflation. And
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:35.320]   China just saw CPI down three tenths of
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.600]   1% in the month this week annualized
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.160]   that's over three and a half percent.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.480]   That is a major problem for China. So I
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.760]   think you have some some yellow flags
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.400]   here, right? Let's say, do we have too
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.240]   much tightening if one of the global
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.720]   engines of growth is experiencing this
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.960]   level of disinflation, that's going to
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.120]   impact the global economy, global demand,
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.960]   etc. So yeah, I think in the pattern of
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.040]   the Fed, right, they they seem to react
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.920]   late, and then the overseer, this has
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:07.720]   been the theme. And so there's also just
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:11.240]   to add one other cloud to the silver
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.080]   lining, it's the amount of debt that's
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.320]   out there. Correct. So both private debt
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.800]   and government debt, yeah, consumer debt
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:21.280]   is high, this real estate commercial
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.840]   real estate's high, got debt everywhere,
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.600]   and people are gonna have to belt tighten
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.360]   and maybe austerity and stop spending on
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:32.040]   some YOLO trips. But if salaries keep
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:32.640]   going up,
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.400]   let's let's
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.760]   bring up this Kona Kowa, who is this?
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.960]   Who are you sharing? It's not a Kona Kowa
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.400]   link. Is it another great Kona Kiyoma?
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.520]   Kobayashi letter.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.920]   Oh, Kobayashi letter. Oh, Kobayashi here?
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.960]   Kobayashi. Yeah, Kobayashi.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.360]   That's got 300,000 followers.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.000]   So we have we have record household debt,
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.080]   17.1 trillion record mortgage debt, 12
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.600]   trillion record auto loans, 1.6 trillion
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.320]   record student loans, 1.6 trillion, which
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.240]   as Dracula Miller points out, have to
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.440]   start being repaid, I think, as of
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.120]   September, because Supreme Court
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.960]   overturned binds and constitutional debt
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.680]   forgiveness. Yep. Record 1 trillion in
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.240]   credit card debt that I think should be
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.800]   pretty worrying because credit card rates
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.840]   are now around 25%. So credit card debt
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.440]   gets the interest on that is it is
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.280]   obviously floating. And so when rates go
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.000]   up to, you know, where they are now, then
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.920]   it gets it gets very punitive. So
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:31.440]   David precisely, and this is remember,
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.320]   we're seeing inflation rollover huge, and
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.560]   we have a chips act in an infrastructure,
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.480]   we have massive government spending going
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.040]   on, and we still see inflation rolling
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.120]   over. So I just find it interesting that
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.600]   within six months, we've gone from
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.600]   worrying about hyperinflation to
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.240]   Bloomberg running a headline summer of
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.080]   disinflation.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.040]   The last piece of it is government debt.
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.840]   So at the rate that the government is
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.520]   racking up deficits, the Treasury is
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:59.360]   gonna have to float something like 3
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.320]   trillion of new T bills by the end of
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.960]   the year. And we're rolling something
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:08.400]   like 9 trillion of old government debt
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.240]   over the next 18 months at new higher
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.000]   interest rates.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.040]   So there's a lot of debt and we'll
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.600]   continue that discussion next week as
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.760]   well as the global warming one hearts
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.080]   and prayers out to the fine people of
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.200]   Maui, who invite us to come to their
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.120]   incredible paradise. We hope you all
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.760]   stay safe and have a great recovery.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.400]   Your thoughts and prayers for Brad
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.280]   Gerstner, the fifth bestie for the
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.080]   architect, David Sachs, and the Sultan
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.880]   of science. I am the world's greatest
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.120]   moderator and officiant if you're
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.920]   getting married. And for Bill Gurley,
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.080]   Bill Gurley, you have some anecdotes
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.640]   about the all in pond you were talking
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.640]   about. BG squared.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.640]   Close on closing on an anecdote.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.880]   Close this out.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.080]   Obviously, huge success you guys have
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.400]   had it when you first mentioned you
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.600]   were going to do this. I don't think
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.280]   anyone had any idea that you would
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.720]   reach this level. And I know the hard
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.880]   work it takes to for you guys to do
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.240]   this weekly. It's amazing. But I was
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.880]   walking down this you guys share
