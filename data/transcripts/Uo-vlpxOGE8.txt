[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.200]   Well, why does it sometimes seem that our worship is thinning out over time?
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.160]   And why does it seem that church worship grows flat over time as well?
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.280]   These are realities we all face at some point, and they lead us to consider the first implication
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.040]   of seeing and savoring the providence of God.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.160]   With the release of Pastor John's new book, Providence, for the next several weeks we
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.680]   are considering reasons why the providence of God, this precious doctrine that we hold
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.840]   so dear, why it's essential to how we live out our daily Christian lives.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.760]   Last Wednesday we opened this new series in episode 1571, looking at why we must live
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.320]   aware of God's providence.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.480]   Now we get very specific.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.960]   There are 10 real-life effects and implications of this doctrine on our lives.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.240]   Here with implication number one is Pastor John.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.800]   The question we are posing is this.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:11.160]   What are the real-life effects of knowing and loving, seeing and savoring the all-pervasive,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:20.400]   all-embracing providence of the ever-wise, ever-just, ever-merciful God of Scripture?
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   That's our question.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.960]   And my first answer is this.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:35.880]   Seeing and savoring this providence awakens and sustains wonder and awe and holy reverence
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.360]   and the kind of trembling joy that leads us into the depth of true, God-centered, Christ-exalting,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.320]   Bible-saturated worship.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.120]   How many times have people asked us on this podcast about their lukewarmness, about how
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.760]   inadequate their affections are for God, about how passion and zeal and joy could possibly
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.360]   be rekindled.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.840]   And now I'm asking, do you know him?
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:23.960]   I mean the real, true, magnificent, mouth-stopping God of all-embracing providence.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   When I was in college, I struggled with those same things.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.200]   I read a book by J.B.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.440]   Phillips, "Your God is Too Small."
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.920]   Remember it, some of you 70-year-olds?
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.040]   I knew it was true.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.000]   I knew it was true.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.760]   But you can't just snap your finger and see the majesty of God.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:54.640]   I was blind to the all-pervasive, all-embracing providence of God, the grandeur of the all-governing,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.520]   purposeful sovereignty of God.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:07.920]   I had, in fact, been taught not to see the actual ruling God, the omnipotence of God
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.240]   as it is in the Bible, the God of the Bible.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.800]   That's what I had missed, the God who really is.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.680]   It was as if glasses had been put on my face that shrank everything down, except maybe
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.880]   for myself.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.840]   The glasses made God manageable.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.680]   Now, within a couple of years, after reading "Your God is Too Small," thank God, I
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.360]   to this day, thank God, some professors grabbed me by the hair and rubbed my nose in the book
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.320]   of Romans and wouldn't let me up until I had seen and smelled and tasted and been stunned
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.800]   by the God of chapters 8 and 9 of Romans.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.200]   All praise to God, I say, all praise to God for those who would not let me escape from
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.280]   Scripture into some philosophical detour that strips God of the glory of his all-governing
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.440]   providence.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.320]   My heart aches to this day.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.280]   In fact, I got a letter just the other day from a pastor who is leaving his church because
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.540]   the elders wanted to go a new, seeker direction.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:33.040]   My heart aches for so many churches bent on being lightweight, seeker-friendly churches
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.160]   while their people are starving.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.600]   They don't know what they're starving for, but they're starving for the greatness of
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   God.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.800]   David Wells, 25 years ago, in his book on "No Place for Truth," put it like this,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:00.320]   "It is this God, majestic and holy in his being, this God whose love knows no bounds
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   because his holiness knows no limits, who has disappeared from the modern evangelical
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   world."
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.600]   Well, yes, that's an overstatement, but it's not without warrant.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.840]   Leslie Newbigin, from the British angle, said the same thing.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   He said, "I suddenly saw that someone could use all the language of evangelical Christianity,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:36.040]   and yet the center was fundamentally the self, and God is auxiliary to that.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:46.240]   True worship is ruined, reduced, gutted, flattened when the majesty of God, especially seen in
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:55.040]   his all-embracing providence, is replaced with a focus on me and my world and how God
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:02.360]   can make me the center of his focus rather than making his greatness the focus of mine."
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.640]   If we see and savor the biblical panorama of the providence of God for what it really
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:20.720]   is, we will lift our hands in silence, groping for words that do not feel pitiful before
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.240]   his majesty.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.040]   He is great beyond our comprehension.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.320]   God has shown us in the Bible more of himself and more of his ways than we will ever exhaust
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.520]   in this world.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:43.300]   I have filled a book, a 700-page book on providence, by simply tracing his counterintuitive wonders
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.000]   through Scripture.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.860]   He has not been sparing in his revelation of his splendors.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:57.760]   They are meant to make us soar and sing over the purposeful sovereignty of God.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:07.000]   And how can we not be God-besotted when every day we are immersed in an ocean of God-given,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.200]   God-governed, God-revealing wonders as we are every day?
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:22.560]   Did not Hannah sing over this providence?
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.840]   The Lord kills and brings to life, the Lord makes poor and makes rich, he brings low and
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.240]   he exalts.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   Did not Miriam sing over this providence?
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.160]   The horse and the rider he has thrown into the sea.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.360]   Did not Moses follow her in song over this providence?
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.680]   Pharaoh's chariots and his host he cast into the sea.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.640]   In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.960]   Who is like you?
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.080]   Majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.020]   And did not the psalmist sing and sing and sing over this providence?
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.160]   The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.140]   He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:18.440]   The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.640]   He makes wars to cease to the ends of the earth.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.520]   He breaks the bow, shatters the spear.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.480]   He burns the chariots with fire.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.820]   Whatever the Lord pleases, he does.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.000]   In heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.640]   And did not Mary, Mary the mother of Jesus, sing over this providence?
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.360]   In Luke 1, the Lord has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:53.600]   He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   That's Mary talking.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   Oh, bless her.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.080]   No wonder we call her Blessed Virgin.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.920]   And did not Paul sing over this providence?
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.320]   Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.120]   How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.720]   For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor or who has given
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.480]   a gift to him that he should be repaid?
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:27.920]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.900]   To him be glory forever and ever.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:42.040]   If there are believers or churches whose worship feels thin and passive and routine, could
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:50.280]   it be that they just do not know this providence, this God?
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:10:00.320]   So real life effect number one, at least in my life, and I have seen it true in hundreds,
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:08.720]   real life effect number one of seeing and savoring the providence of God is this.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:18.000]   It awakens and sustains wonder and awe and holy reverence and a kind of trembling joy
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.160]   that leads us into the depth of true God-centered, Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated, soaring
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.680]   with song worship.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.240]   Powerful.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.800]   The providence of God has this type of a deep influence in our lives.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Such a great reminder.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.240]   Next Wednesday we will return with effect number two, but up next time on the podcast
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.040]   we field one of your excellent questions from the inbox, and it's this question.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.560]   Is the audiobook Bible sufficient for my daily Bible reading?
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.800]   Is the audiobook Bible sufficient for my daily Bible reading?
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.760]   It's a great question from a listener to the podcast who is a professional truck driver.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.160]   That's up on Friday when we return.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.720]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime pastor and author John
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   Piper.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   We'll see you Friday.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.220]   [end]
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.220]   1. Is the audiobook Bible sufficient for my daily Bible reading? Is the audiobook Bible
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:11.220]   sufficient for my daily Bible reading?
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:18.220]   2. Is the audiobook Bible sufficient for my daily Bible reading?
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.220]   You
