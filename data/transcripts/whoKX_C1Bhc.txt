[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.960]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 6, reading again from verse 10 to verse 13.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.920]   From verse 10 to verse 13, in the 6th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, "Finally,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.560]   my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.440]   of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.200]   against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore, take
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.400]   unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.320]   having done all, to stand."
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.760]   We thus resume our studies in this great epistle to the Ephesians, and especially here at the
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.320]   end of this sixth chapter. There is nothing that is more urgently important for all of
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.840]   us who claim the name of Christian than to grasp and to understand the teaching of this
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.720]   particular section. Now I say "those of us who are Christian," because these words are
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.220]   obviously addressed to Christian people, and to Christian people only. They have no message,
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.080]   they have no word for those who are not Christians. Indeed, nobody else can understand them. The
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.720]   world today ridicules this kind of statement. It doesn't believe in a spiritual realm at
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:58.560]   all. It's even doubtful about the being of God. It has no faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.040]   still less, therefore, does it believe that there are principalities and powers and rulers
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.520]   of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness even in high or in heavenly places.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.120]   It's meaningless to it. And because of that, this word, I say, is also meaningless to them.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.800]   But to the Christian, it is something which is not only full of significance, but full
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.400]   of help and of real encouragement. And as I say, there is surely no word that is more
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.640]   urgent and urgently important to all of us who are Christians at the present time than
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.240]   just this. I mean, of course, the whole state of life, the whole state of the world, and
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.440]   all the difficulty of living, and especially of living the Christian life, in these confused
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.680]   times in which we find ourselves. Not that I mean by that that life has ever been easy
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.920]   in this world for the Christian. It hasn't, of course. It wasn't for these early Christians,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.560]   obviously. But here it is today, and in some respects, the problem is more acute and more
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.680]   urgent perhaps than it has ever been. There was a time, until comparatively recently,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.200]   when a man's home at Inuit, everybody's home, was more or less shut off from the world.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.560]   But the world comes into the home now in so many different ways, not only with the newspapers,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.640]   but with the television and the wireless and so on. And thus the fight of faith becomes
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.480]   a particularly difficult and strenuous one to the Christian at such a time. And on top
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.840]   of all this, the general strain of the times and the anxiety of the hour. Very well. It
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.920]   is because of that that we've spent so much time in analysing and considering this statement
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.600]   together. We spent most of our last year in dealing with that phrase about the wiles of
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.040]   the devil, trying to understand what it means to say that we are wrestling, not against
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.840]   mere flesh and blood in ourselves or in other people, but against these spiritual powers
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.800]   and potentates, these principalities, these unseen hordes of wickedness that are at the
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.760]   back of all evil, controlling the minds of evil men and controlling all their activities.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.280]   And they're set against us in order to try to defeat us, to spoil our Christian lives
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.840]   and bring the whole of the gospel into disrepute. That was essential. A man who doesn't understand
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.440]   the nature of the problem he's confronting is a man who's already doomed, of course,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.720]   to failure. There are people who find, they think at first that every subject is quite
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.800]   simple, no difficulties. Well, we know what's going to happen to them when the examination
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.360]   comes. The first thing you have to do is to understand the nature and the character of
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.400]   your problem. And we have to realize that we are called in the Christian life to a battle,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:13.800]   and to a life of ease, to a battle, to a warfare, to a wrestling, to a struggle. That's the
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.080]   thing that we've been looking at and we've seen in detail, the varied, almost endless
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:27.720]   ways in which the devil, in his wildness and subtlety, tries to trap and to ensnare, to
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.320]   confuse and to confound the Christian men. Now that's absolutely essential, and that's
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.360]   why we spent all that time in doing it. That is, I say, in and of itself, half the battle.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.320]   To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and we've been acting on that principle. That, I say,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.720]   is half the battle. But let us remember that it is only half the battle. And were we to
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   leave it at that, well, we would all undoubtedly be depressed. We would say life is bad enough
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.520]   as it is, without your dragging out all these things. You show us that the problem is such
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.280]   that no man is adequate to it. When we are just told that we wrestle against these terrible
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.160]   powers and principalities, well, who is sufficient for these things? Who can stand against such
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:29.840]   mass hordes of evil, with all the subtlety and the malign power? That alone, I say, though
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.600]   absolutely essential, could lead to no result except that we should all feel depressed and
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.320]   completely and entirely hopeless. But thank God, the Gospel never stops at that. The Gospel
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:50.440]   always starts with that. The Gospel is always realistic. The Gospel never hides any of the
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.080]   truth. It never gives a false impression. It's not a true Gospel that gives us the impression
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   that the Christian life is something easy and that there's no problem left. That's not
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.640]   New Testament at all. The New Testament is most alarming at first, terrifying, as it
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.680]   shows us the problem by which we are confronted. But follow it, go on. It doesn't stop at that
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:20.160]   half. It goes on to this addition, this second half. And here it shows us the way in which,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.040]   though that is the truth concerning the battle, we can be enabled to wage it. And not only
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:34.920]   to wage it, we can triumph. We are meant to be more than conquerors. So the Apostle goes
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.760]   on, you see, to show us that, and he does it in his very characteristic manner. He puts
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.200]   this even before the other. You see, he says, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.160]   his might." Put on the whole armor of God that in order that then he brings in his problem.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:08:00.480]   Well, here, I say, is something for which we should thank God this morning. Here and
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.000]   here alone we are told the way in which, though everything is so true about us, and of the
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.720]   world in which we live, and of all the strain and the stress of the hour, though all that
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:18.440]   is absolutely true, as Christian people, we can be enabled to triumph and to rejoice in
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:24.320]   the midst of it all, and to know that victory is assured. And that's the matter to which
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.640]   we now, therefore, come. Now then, what is it? What is it that is offered
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:38.120]   us? As we find ourselves, as Christian people, facing all this, this wrestling, struggle,
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   this combat. Well, you notice there are just two things. Be strong in the Lord and in the
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:53.240]   power of his might. That's one of them. The second is, take unto you the whole armor of
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:02.240]   God. Now, those are the two things. There are some preliminary comments that I have
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:08.680]   to make. The first is that both these are necessary. You don't take one without the
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:15.560]   other. The apostle says both. You've got to do both. We shall have occasion, of course,
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.100]   to repeat that constantly as we go along. I'm just making some preliminary remarks
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:27.240]   to provoke your thought, and for us all to understand together exactly what the apostle
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.480]   is teaching us. Birth together, but then notice the order in which he puts them. He doesn't
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.160]   tell you to put on the armor first, and then to be strong in the Lord. No, the other way
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.240]   around. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, then take unto you the whole
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.920]   armor of God. There's a very real significance in that. I don't stop with that this morning,
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.200]   but I shall have occasion, God willing, to show the significance of that order, and the
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.800]   importance of realizing the order. And then, of course, there is clearly the interrelationship
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:07.760]   between the two. Let me just hint at what we have to develop later, which is this, that
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.520]   so often people take just the one or the other of these, and therefore make shipwreck of
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.240]   the faith. There are some who say all you need is to hand it over to the Lord and rely
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.440]   on his strength. They never say anything about the whole armor of God. That's left out
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.860]   completely. Then there are people who put their whole emphasis on that only, putting
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.580]   on the whole armor of God, as if they could wield it and forget their absolute dependence
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.380]   upon the power of the Lord and his might and his strength. Very well, then, there are obviously
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:45.640]   these interesting matters there in the mere presentation of the two things which are essential
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:51.420]   to a triumphant living of this Christian life. But we start with the first this morning.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.320]   Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:02.880]   Now then, there is a great order issued by this mighty captain, the Apostle Paul, an
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:09.080]   order of the day. Here is a word sent out to the army, gathered together with the enemy
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:16.320]   there in position facing it. Here is the great word that comes from this great leader, who
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.480]   himself had had such experience in warfare personally, and who, as he reminds us so often,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.520]   had the care of all the churches upon him, and had seen at first hand these machinations
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:34.960]   of the evil one amongst God's people. Here it is, a great order for the day. Be strong
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:42.080]   in the Lord and in the power of his might. Hold on to this, don't forget it. In the heat
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.160]   and the thick of the battle, later on in the day, it doesn't matter, never forget this.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:53.080]   This is the great guiding and controlling principle that you must never lose sight of.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:00.360]   But now here is the question. What does it mean? How are we to do this? It's a resounding
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.920]   phrase. I obviously like repeating it and reading it, and you do the same. But that
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:14.420]   isn't enough. We like singing these things, "Put on the gospel armor," and so on.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.040]   But what does it mean in practice? You see, it's essential again that we should look
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:26.000]   into these matters. Christianity is not a form of psychology. You don't just walk
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.120]   along the road saying, "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might," using
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.760]   it as some kind of incantation, or to suggestion, repeating a phrase to yourself. That isn't
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.000]   Christianity at all. That's the cults, of course. That is the psychological method.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.440]   You repeat the phrases, "Every day and in every way I'm getting better and better,"
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.040]   and you persuade yourself, and you think less and less about your health, and you therefore
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.480]   begin to feel better. It works up to a point, but only up to a point. But in any case, I
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.200]   say, it isn't the Christian message. And so often we Christian people are in danger
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.840]   of abusing the scriptures in this way, and we use them just as phrases in that manner,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.600]   and we sing our hymns, and we feel better for the time being. But then the question
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   is how do you stand up to the temptation when you're in the street outside? What do you
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.480]   like at all? That's the whole trouble with these other things. That's what always happens
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.640]   when you turn scripture into a drug, into something which gives you a temporary stimulus
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:30.200]   without you knowing why nor how. It doesn't last. It's a temporary feeling of exhilaration.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.560]   But it isn't with you when you're in the struggle and in the heat of the battle. So
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.680]   we have to look into this. What does all this mean in practice? Well, it means something
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:47.760]   like this, it seems to me. The first thing is that we have to realize the need of being
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:59.000]   strong. Why? Well, we've already answered that question in the main. It is because of
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.280]   the power of the enemy. I don't go back on that. Remember all that. We need to be strong.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.760]   That's the enemy with which we are confronted. Let's not underestimate him in our folly.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:22.200]   The Bible always calls us to face him and to realize he is, as Peter, as a roaring lion
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:30.040]   seeking whom he may devour. We are told that the archangel didn't speak lightly of him
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:35.200]   or loosely with him when he debated with him concerning the body of Moses. He didn't bring
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:43.240]   any railing accusation against him. All that the archangel ventured to say was, "The law
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:51.440]   deal with me." Very well, we mustn't be uncertain, I say, about that or in any kind of confusion.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:58.840]   The enemy is terribly powerful and full of wiles and of subtlety and of guile. He can
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.600]   even transform himself, as we've seen, into an angel of light. Very well, there it is.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.720]   But another reason is this, and a very practical one from our side. If you are going to stand
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:18.840]   and withstand in the evil day, you need this strength. The evil day. Well, we've also glanced
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.480]   at that, haven't we? Though the Christian life, in one sense, is always the same kind
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:33.960]   of life, there are variations. There are evil days. Some days are worse than others. There
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.720]   are some days which are exceptionally bad. Evil days. In general, at the moment, we are
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.840]   living in a very evil day. It's evil in every respect. Oh, I'm not only thinking of the
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:51.600]   international tension. It's an evil day because evil and sin are so powerfully organized,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:59.880]   so deeply entrenched. It's an evil day because of the confusion in the Church herself, which
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.800]   sometimes seems to deny not only the whole of the Gospel, but even belief in the being
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.040]   of God. It's an evil day, my friends. It's not an easy thing to be a Christian at a time
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.520]   like this, when you get men in high positions of authority talking about meeting atheists
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.000]   in heaven. It's an evil day. And all Christians are being confused by these things, particularly
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:31.600]   perhaps young Christians. Oh, the devil is unusually busy and active, creating this uncertainty
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.360]   about it all, this utter confusion. What is the Gospel? What isn't the Gospel? So I say
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.040]   we are undoubtedly in a very evil day. And if you are to withstand at such a time as
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.440]   this, well, there's only one way, and it's the way the Apostle teaches us here. We need
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.280]   this power and the whole honor of God. And then, having done all things, we may be able
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:02.560]   to stand. Thank God. It's all right, though the confusion is terrible. Those who believe
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.960]   the truth still can stand. Don't be disheartened. Don't be discouraged, my friend. Don't be
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:15.920]   misled. Don't be put off. Though you're but one, perhaps you can still be enabled to stand,
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:24.640]   though the days are so cruelly evil and vile and foul. But you see, there are other motives
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.880]   for this and other reasons, other things which should encourage us all to seek this strength
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.920]   and this power. Why should I be strong in the Lord and in the power of his light? All
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.440]   right, I don't want to fail myself. I don't want to be miserable and unhappy, because
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.760]   if I do fail, and when I do fail and fall into sin, I'm miserable, and you're all the
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:54.040]   same. We all are. So to save yourself from that misery that is the inevitable consequence
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.800]   of any failure in the Christian life, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:04.960]   But I'll give you a much higher reason than that. Oh, be strong, because you are who you
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:12.600]   are, because you are what you are. We are individuals in this matter of salvation, but
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:19.560]   we are not isolated units. We are members severally of the body of Christ. We belong
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.800]   to him. We belong to God's family. The last few Sunday mornings we've been looking at
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:31.520]   those great phrases. "Christian, remember this always, that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:39.840]   not ashamed to call you his brother. Remember, above that, that God is not ashamed to be
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:47.200]   called your God." Very well, the name of God is upon us. The name of Christ is upon
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   us. Why should I be strong? Well, for his sake, over and above my own sake. This is
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.400]   an alarming thought in a sense, and yet it's one of the most glorious things we can ever
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:06.280]   realize about ourselves, that the reputation, as it were, of Almighty God, Father, Son and
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:14.040]   Holy Spirit is in our hands. And any failure in us brings the great and holy name into
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:23.560]   disrepute. You're not an isolated individual. You're one in this great and mighty army.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.800]   The world knows how to respond to these appeals, doesn't it? Nelson knew exactly what he
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.940]   was doing on the morning of Trafalgar. England expects that every man this day should do
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:42.480]   his duty. Certainly. The name, the country, very well, multiply that by infinity. And
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:50.800]   you and I have no right to be weak, because our failure not only involves us. The whole
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:57.000]   family in heaven and in earth is involved in us. We are representatives. Very well.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.480]   Let's never forget that. It isn't that you may live a happier life only that I'm
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.640]   calling attention to this text. Let's forget ourselves, my friend. Let's forget this
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.880]   subjective approach. Let's learn to look at things from the standpoint of the Church
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.640]   of the Living God, this great army with banners. Let's think of him who is the captain and
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:24.080]   leader of our salvation. And let's remember that we belong to him, and that anything that
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:31.320]   happens to us inevitably involves him also. So that I put it finally like this. There
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:38.360]   is no better way of giving a proof of the truth of the gospel than that we should be
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:45.040]   strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, than that we should triumph and prevail.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.520]   You see, life, as I say, is so difficult. And when you see somebody succeeding, somebody
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:56.160]   who can stand against the enticements and the insinuations of evil, someone who isn't
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.320]   always carried away by the popular thing and the flood, someone who stands steadfastly
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:09.760]   for truth and for everything that is worthy, what a wonderful testimony it is. And it undoubtedly
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.600]   has a great effect upon those who are looking on. We're all being observed at the present
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.000]   time. The world is utterly unhappy. Men and women don't know what to do. They don't
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.800]   know where to turn. And it's a wonderful thing when they see somebody who seems to
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:29.040]   be calm and steadfast, somebody who isn't utterly bewildered at a time like this, somebody
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.880]   who seems to have an insight into it all and can see beyond it all. They look and they
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:40.160]   say, "What is this?" And so, you see, you become an evangelist by just standing
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.480]   and being strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. You don't go with the flood.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.960]   You don't do it because everybody else is doing something. You have principles of your
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.720]   own, and you are ready to stand for them and to suffer for them. That has often been the
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:22:00.520]   means under God's mighty blessing of awakening others and convicting them of sin and causing
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.840]   them to begin to inquire. Well, now, we're all set in such positions
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.160]   in our daily lives, whatever we are. We're all in some kind of circle, and we're surrounded
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:17.800]   by people who are blinded by the devil, carried along on this evil way. You never know when
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.320]   the mere fact that you are just standing—I'm not asking you to be priggish. I'm not asking
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.120]   you to talk of necessity. But I'm just asking you to show that you can stand when everybody
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:35.520]   else is falling. And thus, you arrest attention, and you open a door of opportunity for the
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.800]   saving gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Well, now, there are some reasons—preliminary
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.400]   considerations, but they're very important. We need to be strong. Very well, but let me
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.440]   put that in another way. Let me say that we've got to realize in the second place our own
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:02.880]   weakness and our need of help. That's the presupposition of what the Apostle is saying
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.740]   here, isn't it? He's not only concerned about this because of the power of the enemy; he's
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:16.160]   equally concerned because of our own weakness, our own lack of strength. And again, this
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:21.640]   can be demonstrated in many ways. How am I to know my weakness as somebody? The natural
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.000]   man knows very little about his own weakness. That's why he's so self-confident. That's
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.200]   why he fails. He doesn't know either the enemy or his own weakness and his own inability.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:39.440]   It's this fatal arrogance of confidence that accounts for all our troubles. But I say,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.960]   the first thing we've got to realize before this text becomes living to us is that we
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.840]   have need of strength and of help. And again, the best way of doing that is to understand
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.760]   something of the power of the enemy. But you've got further help which will bring you to that
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:24:00.200]   point. Go back to the very beginning of the Bible. And what you find there is a man called
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:09.240]   Adam who was sinless and who was perfect. And here he is confronted one afternoon by
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:16.280]   the devil, the one we are discussing, the wildness of the devil. And though Adam was
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:24.080]   perfect and had lived a life of fellowship and of communion with God, he fell, and he
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.560]   fell so easily. The subtlety of the enemy, with his insinuation that God was against
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.960]   men, that God was unfair to men. Well, of course, when the devil does that, what is
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:42.680]   man, even perfect man, made in the image of God? Down he went, he fell. And you see, that
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:50.000]   really ought to be enough. There's no discussion after that. If Adam, in that perfect state,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.480]   fell, who are we to stand? But you've got this abundant evidence following that. Take
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:04.440]   your Old Testament saints, all of them, the patriarchs, the great godly kings, the prophets,
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:10.400]   they've all fallen. Not one of them could stand up to the devil. He's the strong man
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.000]   in arm that keepeth his goods at peace. Down they all go, they've all failed, they've
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.680]   all sinned and come short of the glory of God. They're nothing to the wilds of the
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:29.120]   devil. And this has been the universal testimony of all the greatest saints of the centuries.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.840]   That is one of the hallmarks of the true saint, that he never gives the impression that the
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:40.640]   Christian life is an easy one. Never. That's the man who's confused something else with
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.080]   Christianity always. He's got a shortcut which brings him to a place where everything
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.640]   is quite simple. It's never Christianity that the greatest saints have always testified
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.680]   to the fierceness of the battle, to their own weakness, to their own inability. They've
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:04.520]   mourned over this. Very well, then, I say, let us pay heed to what this great cloud of
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:11.760]   witnesses is saying to us this morning, but let me commend to you also your own experience.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.000]   If you feel you're a very strong person as a Christian, well then let me ask you,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.760]   why have you failed so much? Why do you still fail? What happens to your resolutions and
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:28.600]   resolves? Why do you so often find yourself in the place of repentance? Why are you sometimes
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.040]   attacked with feelings of utter hopelessness and almost despair? What's it due to? It's
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.200]   all due to this. It's due to our weakness. It's because we are weak and fallible that's
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.760]   why we fail. But now, I say, we must face this honestly. It's not enough just to say
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.160]   in general, "Yes, I know, the enemy is very strong, as you say, and I'm weak." We've
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:56.320]   got to persuade ourselves of our weakness. This is half the battle. We need to know that
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:03.960]   we are ill. In other words, we need to indulge in a great deal of self-examination. That's
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.680]   why people don't implement this text. That's why we know so little what it is to stand
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.800]   and to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. We've never realized our own
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.840]   need. They that are whole have no need of a physician. You see, that was the whole trouble
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.320]   with the Pharisees. They thought they were all right. They didn't go to the doctor.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.600]   There was nothing wrong with them. And you don't go to the doctor as long as you feel
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   that all is well. No, no, they that are whole have no need of a physician. But we've got
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:40.960]   to realize, and that means examination, self-examination. And we have thus to discover the elements of
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:47.680]   weakness that are in us inherently and that render us so incapable of fighting this battle.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.520]   Another thing we have to realize is this, that mere principles of morality are not sufficient
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:59.440]   for us. Now, the world has always been interested in what it calls the good life. The philosophers
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.840]   have always been interested in that. They wrote about it and talked about it and argued
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:09.480]   about it, but the trouble was they were never able to practice it. Principles of morality
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.340]   are all right, but they're not enough. And you can read books on ethics, and you can
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.400]   wax eloquent in these matters, but it's a very different thing to put them into practice.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:25.640]   To will is present with me, but how to perform, I know not. I see that this is right, yes,
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.400]   but the problem is, how am I to do it? And it's when you really face that, you realize,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.880]   you begin to realize something of your weakness. And then, of course, that adds the further
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.280]   thing that your willpower alone is not enough. Willpower is excellent, and we should always
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:45.520]   be using it, but it's not enough. A desire to live a good life is not enough. Obviously,
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:52.440]   we should all have it, but it won't guarantee success. So let me put it like this. Oh yes,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:58.840]   hold on to your principles of morality and ethics. Use your willpower to the limit. Pay
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:05.280]   great heed to every noble, uplifting desire that is in you. But having done all that,
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:12.560]   put this plus behind it. That's not enough. That will never bring us to this place. We've
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:20.080]   got to realize that all our best is totally inadequate, that a spiritual battle must be
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.600]   fought in a spiritual manner. Now look at the way it was put in that hymn we sang just
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   now, by Isaac Watts. "From thee, the overflowing spring, our souls shall drink a fresh supply,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:45.520]   while such as trust their native strength, shall melt away and goop and die." It's true.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:53.920]   The arm of flesh will fail you. You dare not trust your own. Now this is the very first
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.880]   beginning of an understanding of this whole matter. You see, the problem is not just the
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.000]   problem of moral living. That isn't the problem we're confronted by. That's the thing the
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.580]   state's interested in. And the state stops at that, of course, because it knows nothing
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.800]   about this spiritual background. Because it knows nothing about the principalities and
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.160]   powers. And that is why it still goes on believing, you see, that education can really solve the
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:23.640]   problem, or the reform of prisons, and psychotherapy now in prisons, and all these things. But
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.840]   the more they do it, the more the problem seems to increase. Simply because they don't
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.160]   realize the spiritual character of the problem. Very well, you and I have to realize the same
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.600]   thing. It doesn't follow automatically. Many a man has come into the Christian life through
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.680]   regeneration, through experience, and then through failure to understand this, has tried
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:54.200]   to live the Christian life in the old terms. He thinks that he needs this act of God in
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.960]   Christ to save him, but he seems to leave it at that. Now, henceforward, he's going
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.440]   to do it. He's got a new understanding, so now he's going to live this life. But
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:11.280]   you can't. That's the road along which people melt away and droop and die, because
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.800]   they're trusting to nothing but their native strength. No, no, this is a battle that has
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.640]   to be fought in a spiritual manner and with spiritual understanding. What does it mean?
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.600]   Well, it means this. This is the next matter, therefore, the third general principle. Having
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:32.280]   realized that I am to be strong, and that I myself am incapable of that, because I'm
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:38.840]   essentially weak. I'm still in the flesh. I'm still in the body. And it's still true
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.880]   that the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   are contrary the one to the other. All that is still true of me. And I'm here in this
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.600]   warfare. And I'm up against this terrible power. Well, very well, what's the next thing?
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:01.560]   What is this? Well, it is to realize that he is strong, that he is mighty. Now then,
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:13.160]   here it is. Be strong in the Lord. The Lord! And as the Old Testament reminds us, the name
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:19.120]   of the Lord is a strong power. Well, yes, you see, his very name is why? Well, because
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.280]   the name represents him, who he is, and what he is. And the first thing, therefore, we
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.840]   have to realize is the greatness of his strength. That's what the Apostle is saying here.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:38.560]   Now, listen to the words. We must examine them. He says, "Be strong in the Lord, and
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.680]   in the power of his might." Now, this is a tremendous expression. Do you realize the
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:51.280]   full significance? What does he mean by the power of his might? Well, the basic thing,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:56.960]   obviously, is the might. We are referred to the power of his might. Well, what's his
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   might? Well, the difference between power and might is this. Might means power and strength
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:13.640]   as an endowment. Might means inherent power, something a man is given. Think of a very
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:21.160]   strong man muscularly. Now, the might is that man's inherent muscular strength and power.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:26.800]   That's what's meant by might. What is power, then? Well, power means the manifestation
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:37.480]   of that might. That might that's there as a potential, inherent, now manifesting itself,
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:45.160]   showing its efficacy, its efficaciousness, showing that it can be effectual. This great
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:53.640]   reserve of strength and power actually in operation, doing something, not the endowment
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.520]   itself now, but the proof of the fact that you've got the endowment. And so the Apostle,
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   you see, uses the two terms, and it's important that we should look at both. He says, "Be
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.720]   strong in the Lord and in the might of his strength." So you start by reminding yourself
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.920]   of his strength. "Look at him," he says. "Look at his power." You've been looking
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.240]   at the enemy, and you've seen his strength. You've looked at yourself, and you're trembling
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:28.080]   in your weakness and in your ineffectiveness. Well, now he says, "Look at him. Be strong
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:36.320]   in the Lord." How can I be strong in the Lord? Well, remember the might of his power,
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   the might of his strength. Put it whichever way you like, it doesn't matter. But look
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:48.280]   at him as it were, and realize all the reserves of strength and power that are in him. Now,
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:53.120]   that's what these New Testament epistles are doing, you see, almost everywhere. "In
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.680]   him," says the Apostle to the Colossians, dealing with much the same thing, "in him
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:07.080]   dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." It's there in him. "In him," he says again,
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:13.160]   "God has treasured up all his treasures of wisdom and of knowledge." It's all there.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:22.080]   You see, that is this might, this tremendous inherent strength and power. "Be strong
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:29.340]   in the Lord." Oh, you see, this means meditating about him, doesn't it? It isn't just a phrase,
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:35.320]   an incantation, as I say. No, no, it means that you sit down and remind yourself of these
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.880]   things, and you look at him, and you remind yourself of some of the things that are true
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.520]   concerning him. Well, how do you do that? Well, this is the way you do it. And you see,
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.840]   this is the main reason for reading your scriptures regularly, reading your Gospels in particular.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.200]   You don't read your scriptures just that you've read your daily portion, and you're
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.160]   a good boy, a good scout, you've done that portion for the day. That's no reason for
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.040]   reading the scriptures. Now, I'm not attacking systematic reading. I'm a great advocate of
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.280]   systematic reading, but all I'm saying is be careful that the devil in his wildness
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.160]   doesn't come in, you see, and make you content with a mechanical reading of your scriptures
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:18.140]   without looking at them, meditating upon them, realizing what they're saying, drawing the
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:22.880]   lesson for yourself, praying about it. It takes time. It's very easy to read a number
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.360]   of verses and rush off to catch your bus. That's not reading the scriptures. That's
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.740]   in a sense quite useless. It's not profitable. No, no, you've got to stop and look. So you
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:41.160]   go back to your Gospels and you look at him. The power of his strength. Well, where do
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:50.220]   I see it? Well, I see it in his life. I see him here in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:56.700]   I see him in the same world that I'm in. I see that obviously he knew hunger and thirst
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:02.240]   and physical weakness and tiredness. He knew what it was to be disappointed with people.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.980]   He's gone through it all, and yet what I see as I look at him is that he stands. He
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.980]   always stands. There's never a wavering, stillness, a failing or a faltering or a falling.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:21.800]   He stood. With the world and the flesh and the devil, everything against him, he stood.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:27.420]   And therefore as I just look at his life, I see at once someone who walked through this
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:34.500]   world without deviating in any respect. He just stood and went on steadfastly. In his
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:43.300]   life I see it plainly. But wait a minute, I see even more than that. I see it in all
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:49.600]   his miracles, but I see it especially in the miracles in which he cast out devils. You
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.380]   remember in considering the wilds of the devils, we spent some time on devil possession and
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:38:01.660]   things like that. And it's still a problem, but here is one, you see, to whom it wasn't
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:08.260]   a problem. Here is one who can command the devils. He can exorcise them. He speaks with
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:13.500]   power and with authority. And the devils have to come cringing to him, asking him to spare
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:19.540]   them, not to cast them into the swine that they might be destroyed. Here's a master.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:24.060]   They come to him and say, "We know who you are. You are the Holy One of God." You see,
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.700]   here is one who, when the devils are powerful and operating with a word, the disciples couldn't
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.920]   do that. Look at the boy at the foot of the Mount of Transfiguration. The men had brought
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.300]   the boy to the disciples. They'd done their best, but they couldn't help. Here was this
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:43.180]   poor boy, still an utter victim of this power. But, you see, at a word from our Lord, the
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.300]   devil is driven out and the boy is healed and he is restored to his father. Well, here
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:56.180]   is his power in operation. Here you see something of the power of his might. He's a master
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:01.220]   of the principalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, the spiritual
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:11.780]   wickedness in high places, but we go beyond that. See all this power of his might revealed
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:21.580]   in his own temptation, because here he is meeting directly the devil himself. Not some
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:28.180]   of the emissaries, not one or the other of these principalities or powers, the devil
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:34.580]   himself, the wiles of the devil. Here the devil himself has to take charge of the situation
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.900]   because he realizes it's the biggest problem that he's ever confronted, and so he came
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:45.700]   to our Lord and tempted him 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness and on other occasions,
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:53.820]   but was utterly and entirely defeated. With mere words of scripture, our Lord repels him
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.380]   and the devil falls back defeated, waiting for another season, but having completely
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:05.460]   failed in spite of all opportunities. Very well, I say, here's the thing to be dwelling
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.340]   upon, here's the thing to consider. That's not just a detail or an incident in the life
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:14.940]   of our Lord which helps you to understand his person. It does that, of course, and attests
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:20.220]   his person, but now, says the apostle, make practical use of that. Take that up, take
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:28.060]   hold of that yourself. There you see he met, in this single combat, the devil with all
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:35.940]   his power in operation, but easily defeated him. Be strong in the Lord and in the power
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:41.260]   of his might. Can't you see that power was in him, and when the devil comes, he just
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:46.060]   shows it. He just lets a little bit out, as it were, and the devil is immediately repulsed.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:50.840]   That's it. So now you lay hold of that, says our Lord, and then James says afterward, grasping
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.980]   this point you see, resist the devil and he'll flee from you. That's the way it works out,
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:04.280]   but it doesn't work out until you and I are quite certain about his power and really do
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:11.620]   know something of the power of his might. This inherent power, oh yes, in him dwelleth
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:19.300]   all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. He's God and man. He cannot fail, he didn't fail.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:26.740]   And finally, of course, he proves it on the cross and in the resurrection. What was happening
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:33.940]   on the cross? Ah, it seems to be the day of the power of evil, doesn't it? And evil thought
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:39.060]   that the devil and all these powers thought it, and the world thought it. They riled against
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.940]   him, they laughed at him, they mocked, they jeered. Thou that savest others, come down
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:49.620]   and save thyself, but you can't do it. The devil has defeated you. Has he? Do you know
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:55.540]   what was happening there? He was taking these principalities and powers, says Paul in Colossians
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.700]   2, and putting them to an open shame, triumphing over them in it, by it. That's his triumph
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:07.940]   over them. When they think they've beaten him, he's beating them. Now is the judgment
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.300]   of this world, he says beforehand, looking at the cross. Now is the judgment of this
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:21.780]   world. Now is the prince of this world cast out, cast forth. That's what's happening.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:29.340]   On the cross. So look at the cross. Meditate upon it. You see, this is the supreme paradox.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.940]   He appears to be dying in weakness, but my friend, do you see the inherent strength there?
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:40.140]   Do you see this might of his? Do you see the power of the God up there, turning even that
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:47.180]   into the vanquishing of the devil and setting his people free? A glorious, victorious triumph.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:52.860]   Look at it and see it, and then go on and look at the resurrection. Bursts us under
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:43:01.980]   the bands of death. Triumphs over the last enemy and the ultimate effect of sin and evil.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:09.340]   Is master completely over all these powers that are set against us. He defeats them all.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:15.780]   He arises, he ascends into heaven, leading captivity captive. He's the conqueror over
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:24.500]   everything that is set against us. Yes, you see, it comes back to that. This isn't some
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.540]   psychological trick that you can apply. I'm going to go into this in greater detail following
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:38.060]   Sunday's God willing. But you see, it comes back to this. To know him. You'll never know
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:45.060]   this in your life until you know him. So we've got to know him. We shall find when we come
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.580]   to the various portions of the armour that they're nearly all directed to that. To know
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:54.940]   him. To know about him, the truth concerning him. And it's the only way. You see, you start
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:06.620]   with it here already. In the Lord, and in the power of his might. Do we realize something
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:13.900]   of this? Do we know anything about it? Forget yourself for the time being, in other words.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:21.860]   And look at him. And realize the truth about him. Once we realize that this really does
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:28.080]   happen, it's the whole key to it. So we look at him objectively as he's portrayed to us,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:38.620]   as he reveals himself to us. And then we realize that we belong to one who is the Lord. And
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:45.620]   that all the fullness of the Godhead is in him. That there is invincible might and power
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:54.140]   in him. And that it's a might and a power that is not only potential, it becomes kinetic,
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:45:03.740]   it shows itself, it manifests itself on our behalf and indeed in us. Very well then. Here
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:13.460]   we begin to look at this saving word that enables us even in this evil day to stand,
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:22.660]   to withstand, to be strong, to fight the battle of the Lord and to bring honor and glory to
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:28.300]   his great and holy name. Amen.
