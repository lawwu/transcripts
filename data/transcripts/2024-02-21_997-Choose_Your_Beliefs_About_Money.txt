[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   Hey, Radicals, quick thank you before we begin today's podcast. Last week, I published the
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.280]   announcement for the inaugural Radical Family Camp happening in Indiana in April, and I put
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.960]   tickets on sale last week. As of today, all of the tickets are sold out for that event,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.920]   which is just outstanding. For an inaugural event, to sell out all the tickets in a week just blows
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.040]   me away, and I'm really, really grateful to you for your response. I rented an entire church camp.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.240]   I have 28 cabins, and they're pretty high capacity, but as of today, those have all been
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.760]   filled. And so I have created a wait list. I'm working to see if I can get access to a
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.920]   handful more cabins. I rented an entire complex of this large church camp that's there in Indiana,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.680]   but there's a handful more cabins that I may be able to get next to the primary complex that I
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.400]   have there. So if you are interested, make sure you go to RadicalFamilyCamp.com, put your name
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.320]   on the wait list, and we'll see if we can increase that just a little bit. Otherwise,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.040]   hopefully, this inaugural event will go swimmingly well, and hopefully, every attendee will be
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.840]   thrilled with the event, and hopefully, we can do them more in the future in other places around
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.040]   the country. But just a big, solid, hearty thank you from me. I really appreciate your response,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.920]   and I'm excited to spend a really great time with you. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.360]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.280]   you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.560]   10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets, and today, I want to talk to you about mindset.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.000]   Mindset is something that is clearly important in wealth building, and yet, it is something that has
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.200]   been difficult for me to talk about because I don't get into just kind of frou-frou, airy-fairy
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.960]   ideas. I want to really understand how my mind works in order to then harness it for my own
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.520]   purposes. And today, I'm ready to talk to you about one component of mindset. I want to begin
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.800]   with a tweet. This comes from some random Twitter user named John Lefevre, and he writes this.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.360]   I'm not exactly sure what the date on this is, probably a month or two ago. I've been waiting
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.800]   on this. I had it in my files for a while, waiting to comment on it. "Could the outlook get any more
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.560]   bleak? Housing has never been more expensive. Transportation has never been more expensive.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.960]   Food and energy have never been more expensive. Credit card debt has never been higher.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   Household savings have never been lower. Health insurance has never been more expensive.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.640]   Americans have never been fatter. Inflation is here to stay. Higher rates are here to stay.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.120]   The labor market is cooling. Government spending and our national debt have never been higher.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.840]   Our nation is politically and culturally divided. Geopolitical instability is fermenting,"
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.120]   I think he meant fomenting, "is fermenting around the globe. Illegal immigration has never been
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.640]   higher. Crime is exploding. World War III is a legitimate possibility. The constitution is under
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.200]   attack. The justice system has been corrupted and broken. The party in power is weaponizing
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.040]   the judicial branch to silence its leading opponent and calling for the deprogramming
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.960]   of 75 million citizens." That's the tweet. Now, here's how we need to look at the world.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   We need to begin, before we ever go out into the world and look at things, we need to begin
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.640]   by consciously, excuse me, self-consciously examining our own perspective. As I approach
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.280]   my fifth decade of life, I am increasingly convinced that all of us go out into the world
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.960]   and we see exactly what we believe. We see what we believe. We do not believe what we see.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:42.000]   On the contrary, we go out and we see what we believe. I want to give you a long list of proof
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.440]   for that statement. Words fail me. You test it for yourself and you see if you don't find evidence
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.880]   to confirm your belief in what I have said. But to me, this is something that I see all the time.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.440]   And if true, that means that we need to be very careful about what we believe.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.920]   The simplest example we can begin with is the classic discussion about the difference between
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.120]   a pessimist and an optimist. A pessimist is one who looks at the glass of water and says,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.520]   "The glass is half empty." An optimist is one who looks at the glass of water and says,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.040]   "The glass of water is half full." Now, the facts of the height of the level of the water column in
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.120]   the glass are not under dispute. There is 50% capacity, 50% of the glass's capacity is filled
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.080]   with water. But the way that you interpret those facts or that fact is very much dependent on
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.960]   you and on your belief and/or some practical application. This is goofy, but it's real.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.040]   I have to consistently teach my children not to fill water glasses to the normal 80% capacity
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.720]   because then when they get knocked over at our dinner table, we have quite a mess.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.840]   And so I teach them to fill our glasses to about 30% capacity so they're less top heavy and we have
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.720]   fewer messes at our dinner table. And so even the fact of the glass being 50% filled in and of
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   itself can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on context. It's all dependent on
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.280]   your perspective. Life is not as simple as these "facts" that this particular Twitter user is
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:23.840]   writing about. Some of these facts are clearly correct, I would guess. I mean, World War III
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.960]   is a legitimate possibility, and it has been a legitimate possibility ever since the end of
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.760]   World War II. It is and will always be a legitimate possibility until it happens,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   and then World War IV will be a legitimate possibility. And it's up to us as human beings
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   and what we do as to whether or not it will in fact happen and whether it happens in our lifetime.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.600]   Similarly, some of these things are clearly incorrect, clearly false. Household savings
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   have never been lower. Nonsense, right? We go back a couple hundred years and household savings
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.000]   didn't exist in a monetary form. Now, I'm not here to be the hyperbole police. I'm just simply
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.040]   pointing out to you that whether you accepted all those statements as facts or not has a lot to do
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.760]   with your mindset, with your preconceived ideas. And all of us do this. The problem that we need
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:19.200]   to face quite straightforwardly is that the way that we perceive the world about us impacts our
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.760]   actual lifestyle decisions. Here's another tweet from a user called SpaceBiker1488. Don't you love
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.240]   Twitter? "The worst part about political doomerism is that it encourages you to flee power. Get out
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.760]   of the cities. Don't invest. Don't start a business. Don't run for office. Just hide in
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.200]   the woods waiting to die." And I think that tweet is quite appropriate because this user really does
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:50.320]   point out the truthfulness that certain mindsets, you basically seal your fate if you adopt certain
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.560]   mindsets. And so what we need to be very consciously careful of is the kinds of beliefs that
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.360]   we have, the kinds of beliefs that we build into our mindsets, into our psyche, into our basic
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.880]   functioning paradigm. Here, I want to introduce a very valuable email from a listener of mine
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.840]   who wrote to me several weeks ago. And this listener wrote to me from Alabama. He says,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.200]   "Hi, Joshua. I enjoyed your episode 993 about wealth and poverty being contagious
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.080]   and agree with your ideas. Nicely done. I've previously run across a philosophical term
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.160]   which relates to the idea you expressed toward the end of the episode that I thought you might
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:36.400]   enjoy knowing. Metaphorical truth versus literal truth. Metaphorical truth refers to an idea that's
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:43.440]   not literally true, but is so useful and advantageous to accept and follow that one should
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:52.000]   act as if it is literally true. A great example is all guns are loaded. It's not literally true,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.240]   but it serves one well to act as if it were. Thank you for all your great work." And thank you,
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.520]   Wayne, for writing me the email because this is, I had not heard the term, but it perfectly
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.800]   encapsulates the point that I was driving at in that episode and the point that I want to drive
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:17.520]   at today. Metaphorical truth is something that you can choose to affirm as being true
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:24.560]   because of its usefulness to your life. As a lifelong gun user, gun owner, et cetera,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.240]   I live by the truth of the statement that all guns are always loaded. I assume that all guns
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.520]   that I touch, all guns that I handle are always loaded. And it really doesn't matter if I've
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:45.200]   checked it once, I'm going to check it two more times. It doesn't really matter if there's a flag
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.360]   in the breach. I'm still going to check it myself. And I'm probably not going to look down the barrel
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.680]   of the gun until I've verified three or four times that this gun truly is unloaded. And so
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.640]   the point is to say that there are things that you can call to be true. You can say all guns are
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.920]   loaded. They are always loaded until you've proven about five or six times that they're not loaded.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.520]   And then you finally accept that, okay, this gun in this case, it's literally true that it's not
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.240]   loaded, but we are very slow to get there. Now, in most things in life, we're probably not going
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.160]   to be so precise about every single thing that we believe, but we should take a very careful
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.000]   inventory of the beliefs that we have because the beliefs that we have about life are going
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.400]   to basically serve up the life that we have. So for example, somebody takes that doomerism
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.560]   philosophy, everything is falling apart, get out of the cities, run away to the woods,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.600]   it's the only place that you can go and just hide away. Well, as this user, SpaceBiker says,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.760]   that really is going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead of seeking to fight to change
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.560]   things, instead of going and becoming highly educated and forming a committee to change
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.360]   something or forming an organization to fight against something or becoming a judge or a lawyer
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   or a businessman or whatever, you're just never going to do any of those things because you've got
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:14.720]   a doomerist fatalist mindset that's going to lead to your being impotent. And so because you believe
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.920]   that you're going to be impotent, you're actually going to be impotent. What you believe about
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.240]   yourself, what you believe about your life, what you believe about your opportunities is probably
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   going to come true. There's many statements by many famous and successful men that whether you
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.400]   believe something to be true, it is true for you. If you don't believe it to be true, it's not true
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:44.880]   for you. And our world, sometimes we're just so awash in stories and examples of people who have
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.960]   created just incredible opportunities for themselves just simply due to the ferocity of
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.520]   their belief, when outside circumstances would lead none of us to say that somebody should believe
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.320]   something. I want to give you another example. And to be clear, I'm speaking in analogies,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.960]   because I don't want you to resist what I'm saying by following your preconceived beliefs
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.200]   about the job market is terrible, I can't find an opportunity. That's why I'm speaking in analogies.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.320]   But this example that I'm about to give you is rather poignant. It's a little bit uncouth,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.280]   it's not excessively vulgar, but it's a little bit uncouth. This comes from
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:28.480]   John Morrow again on Twitter. And here is John Morrow's tweet. I always thought I would die a
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.640]   virgin. I'm in a wheelchair. I have less strength than a toddler. I need help eating, going to the
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.040]   bathroom, everything. Guys like me didn't get laid. It was just a fact of life. But a part of me
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.120]   wondered, what if I'm wrong? In my 30s, I decided to test it. I hired a dating coach and started
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.720]   asking 10 women a day to have coffee with me. 10 years later, I've been on over 500 dates,
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:59.040]   four relationships of two plus years, two marriage proposals. I said no both times.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:05.120]   And my love life would make Hugh Hefner blush. Moral of the story, test your beliefs to find
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.840]   out if they are true. You might find the cage around you exists only in your mind.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.320]   And from John's Twitter profile, the amazing guy, born paralyzed, hundreds of broken bones,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:24.720]   pneumonia 16 times, built a business using a lip operated mouse, traveled the world. You have no
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:32.080]   excuses. And if you look at a picture of John on his Twitter profile, he is profoundly disabled.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:40.560]   I don't need to make the point more obvious, but any male red pill dating coach would come along
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.320]   and say, "Yeah, this guy, he's got nothing. He's got nothing." And yet, John's experience
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:53.200]   demonstrates the opposite. Be very careful what you believe, because you're going to find in life
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.400]   whatever you believe. So, what can you and I do? Well, we can begin by systematically installing
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:09.040]   into our mindset appropriate beliefs. We can do that systematically, if not regularly. What I mean
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:18.400]   is that real belief takes an idea, a concept, and it looks for evidence of that. I have a belief
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:27.600]   system that says that almost anything is possible. But that belief system has been buttressed by
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.080]   many, many examples. And so, when I come across a post by a paralyzed man, John Morrow, on Twitter,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.320]   the one I just read you, then I just see constant reinforcement of my beliefs, because I've
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   cultivated these beliefs, and then I've found evidence for the beliefs. So, therefore, the
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.960]   beliefs get stronger and stronger and stronger. And the same thing happens the other side. If
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.560]   you cultivate a belief that is a negative belief, then all you see is constant and never-ending
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:03.200]   reinforcement of those beliefs. And I don't want to give you a lot of financial beliefs,
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.880]   but what I do want to give you is some mindset beliefs that will lead to your developing your
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.240]   own financial beliefs. Maybe in the future, we'll talk about specifics of money. But here are some
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:23.360]   beliefs that I think are very useful. I'm now drawing this list from a man named Dickie Bush.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.600]   Once again, I've built this entire show on tweets, so I hope you enjoy
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.480]   my show built on tweets. But this comes from Dickie Bush. Dickie is a very popular writer.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.760]   He left Wall Street Investment Banking, something like that, to build a writing business.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.440]   And he's just a very wise and intelligent guy. I really enjoy his content. But he posted and
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.800]   shared nine core beliefs that shape the way that he sees the world. And I think this is a good
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:57.360]   example of beliefs that you should consider adopting for yourself. Because whether these
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:04.640]   beliefs are literally true or metaphorically true really doesn't matter. They're true enough
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.720]   that if you adopt them as true, you will get better results in your life, in your finances,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.400]   in every aspect of your life by simply adopting these things to be true. Here's belief number one.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:27.920]   Everything in this world is 100% rigged in your favor. I repeat, everything in this world
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:35.760]   is 100% rigged in your favor. When you go out into the world believing that there is
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:43.600]   a powerful force that is – I'm choosing to use non-Christian language for a moment. I don't know.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.120]   I don't even know how you do it. I believe that there is a sovereign God who has divinely
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.000]   orchestrated every single event in my life for my good and for my well-being, every single one of
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.520]   them. Now, whether I experience those things as what we commonly call blessings or whether I
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.800]   experience those things as whether we commonly call trials to me is entirely immaterial. If it's
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.880]   a blessing, then I'm going to rejoice in the blessing. If it's a trial, I'm going to rejoice
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.720]   in the trial, and I'm going to let the trial have its work in me. So, this is something that,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.960]   as a Christian, is very easy for me to accept because I consider it to be absolutely true.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.400]   I consider it to be literally true and metaphorically true that everything in this
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.880]   world is 100% rigged in my favor and that everything is that I have, again, an omnipotent
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   sovereign God who is manipulating world circumstances for my good. It's a powerful
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.800]   belief, and I submit it to you for your consideration. Everything in this world
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:48.240]   is 100% rigged in your favor. Number two, every circumstance is an opportunity for progress.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:57.040]   Every circumstance is an opportunity for progress. Now, we appreciate the wins. We appreciate the
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.080]   things that we can boast about, the things that we can express joy over of our great wins. I'm
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.800]   rejoicing that my event sold out in less than a week. It's wonderful. It's fantastic. But let's
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.160]   say it hadn't. Could I have learned something? Was there an opportunity for progress?
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:22.560]   Enormous opportunities for progress. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you learn. But you have to
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:29.440]   build a big, strong stack of failures and learning events, etc., in order to ultimately win at the
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.640]   highest level. And so one of the things that we need to cultivate in ourselves is an appreciation
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.840]   that all circumstances are opportunities for progress. Number three, every outcome in your
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:52.080]   life is 100% your responsibility. Every outcome in your life is 100% your responsibility.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:58.960]   Now, notice the words. People are quick to say, "Every outcome in life is not 100% my fault. It's
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.080]   not my fault." No, the word is not fault. I would not affirm the idea that every outcome in your
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:16.000]   life is 100% your fault. No, it's not true. All of us are subject to enormous outward circumstances.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.400]   After all, if a sovereign god of the universe is ordering circumstances in my life, then clearly
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.680]   it's not my fault. It's not of my doing. But that doesn't make it not my responsibility.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:33.200]   So by adopting the mentality that every outcome in my life is 100% my responsibility,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:40.800]   I am now empowered to do things. I have the right mindset, and now I start taking action.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:46.960]   And what's amazing is that people who do this in their life find enormous resources start
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.520]   flowing towards them. People who take responsibility for their life, who take
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:58.720]   responsibility for the outcomes, take responsibility for everything, wind up finding that they don't
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:05.840]   actually have to do it all. It's the attitude that changes everything. Every outcome in your life
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:16.000]   is 100% your responsibility. Next, number four. Everything you want, you must initiate yourself.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:24.400]   Everything you want, you must initiate yourself. I love this one. I love this one.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:31.920]   I love the choice of words. Initiate. Start. Take action. Do something for it. To start it.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:38.480]   To initiate it. Everything you want, you must initiate yourself. If you want to get rid of any
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:44.160]   of that list of bad things happening for yourself that I started off with, the tweet, you have to
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.200]   start with someone. You have to start with yourself, and you have to start with doing
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:20:00.880]   something towards something. Now, the great paradox of modern life is while external circumstances,
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:08.240]   let me begin by stating it in a freedom context. It's hard for me to imagine a time in history in
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:19.200]   which our collective freedom has ever been lower, and yet our individual freedom has ever been
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:26.800]   higher. What I mean is Big Brother has more power and capability today than ever before in human
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.840]   history. So, Big Brother can know everything about you, and there's all kinds of powerful
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:38.400]   forces that are arrayed against you, and yet you as an individual have never had more power and
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.680]   freedom of choice than you have today. If you were to go back to the medieval era, okay, maybe
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.400]   the actual powers that controlled your life were much smaller. They were less centralized,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.960]   but you had a lord of the manor, and you could just leave and walk away from the lord of the
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.080]   manor. You could get away from him more easily, but you as an individual had far fewer options
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.640]   because there just weren't as many opportunities in life. Whereas today, all right, Big Brother
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.960]   may be really big and powerful, but you as an individual have more freedom. Similarly,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.000]   we could apply that same framework to almost any of the complaints on this list. Housing has never
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.400]   been more expensive, for example. Is that true? Well, to an extent, certainly, and yet your
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:26.480]   individual housing choices, you have more choice today than you've probably had ever before in
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:32.400]   human history, because you can choose at what level you want to access the housing market.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.880]   If you want to live in a penthouse condo in downtown Vancouver, well, it's going to be
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.400]   expensive, and you better make sure that you earn the money. On the other hand, if you want to go
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.960]   live in a tent in the middle of some free land, you can go and do that. You can get a tent for
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.040]   89 bucks at Walmart, or you can make your own out of animal skins like our ancestors did,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.720]   and you can go live on free government land, and you can spend the rest of your life that way.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   And I'm not actually being facetious with this example. These truly are your choices, and you
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.000]   can choose anywhere along the scale that fits your imagined lifestyle of the way that you want to
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.320]   live. So in order for you to make change, though, you have to initiate it. You have to decide,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.360]   "I want to be free of this problem," or "I want to access something." Everything you want,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:22.000]   you must initiate yourself. You have to start, and when you start, your brain will immediately
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.160]   bring to you solutions as to how you can accomplish things in your life.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.280]   One of the reasons I branded 10 years ago this show Radical Personal Finance is this very concept,
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.400]   that I was so enthusiastic about the idea that an individual can make a difference,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.120]   and I just felt like the ideas of individual choice were dramatically underrepresented
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.400]   in personal finance circles. Years ago, back I think before the show started, I read a story
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.720]   about a young programmer who had a dream to build his own website, didn't have any money,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.080]   took all his savings, bought a tent, figured out an internet signal, I guess, this was pre-satellite
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.360]   internet, and moved out to the woods, I think it was in Sweden or something, and spent an entire
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.760]   summer living in the woods programming, came back from the woods with his working programming
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.320]   project, and launched his technology startup. That's available to you. The barriers to that
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.160]   are all in your mind. They're all in a matter of lifestyle and what's normal, etc. If you want
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.600]   something, you can initiate it yourself, and that initiation will then start resources flowing
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:31.840]   towards you. Number five, every person you come across has something to teach you. Such a powerful
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.360]   way to interact with other people. Every person you come across has something to teach you.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:43.760]   Your arch enemy, your arch rival, your biggest opponent has something to teach you, and if you
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.960]   go out and interact with people looking for the lessons that you can learn, you will make enormous
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.560]   accomplishments and strides in your life, and all of your relationships will be bettered. Your
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:02.080]   friendships will be bettered, because your friends will sense that expression of appreciation that
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.640]   comes to you when you listen carefully, and you look for the areas that they're really excellent
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:12.160]   in. Your enemies will ultimately be vanquished by you, because you learn from where your enemies
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:19.920]   are strong, and you figure out how to counter that. Number six, everything is learnable if
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:27.520]   you can find the ideal scene. Everything is learnable if you can find the ideal scene.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:37.200]   We are living in a day and age in which access to information has never been more powerful.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.240]   If you can put access to information together with access to people – also, by the way,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:50.720]   I feel I affirm the access to people has never been easier today than it is today – then you
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.280]   can learn anything that you want to learn. It will take time, undoubtedly take enormous amounts
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:02.160]   of effort, etc., but everything is learnable. Number seven, everything you want will stand
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:11.520]   on the other side of a limiting fear. Everything you want will stand on the other side of a limiting
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.240]   fear. I'm afraid to talk too much about this one, because I would have to expose my fears.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:23.680]   And my base fear is usually wanting to look good in front of other people. For whatever reason,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.160]   I'm sure it's a common human thing, but one of the themes of my life has generally been that
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.080]   I like to look good, I like to have a good reputation, etc., and I can identify specifically
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:40.000]   in that particular fear how many times that fear has held me back. I have podcast episodes about it,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   a practical application of it, but wanting to look good in front of other people has limited
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.480]   me in many ways. Now, your fears may be different, but everything you want will stand on the other
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.080]   side of a limiting fear. That's such a powerful concept, a powerful belief to install in your mind,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.800]   so then you can tackle the fears that are limiting you from going after things.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.080]   Just this week, in my own thinking, I was listening to a motivational video while I was
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.600]   exercising, and I enjoy these because they're kind of a hodgepodge. There's tons of them on
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.520]   YouTube. Go to YouTube, search "motivation," and there's all kinds of dudes out there that are
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.560]   cutting up all these interesting clips, etc. And I heard some speaker make the comment of,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.160]   basically, a variation of, "What is that thing that you dare to dream if you knew you could not
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.280]   fail?" I can't tell you how many dozens and dozens and dozens of times I've heard that question. I
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.600]   can't tell you how many dozens of times I've carefully considered it. But then I realized
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:47.200]   afresh, "Wait, I know what that thing is. I know what that thing is. Now I know why I'm afraid of
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   it." And it laid out for me kind of a clear vision of something that I was missing. So,
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   adopt the belief that everything you want will stand on the other side of a limiting fear.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:04.560]   Number eight, every investment you make can have positive returns if you choose so.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:14.800]   Every investment you make can have positive returns if you choose so. Isn't that powerful?
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.320]   Especially in a financial context. Sometimes your investments compound and make you enormous
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:27.280]   amounts of money. Sometimes you lose your shirt. You know which lessons you're going to remember
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   the most keenly? It's the ones in which you lost. I was recently talking about learning.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:42.400]   One of the things that I have come across, I've done a really deep dive into learning science.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:49.200]   And one of the things that's fascinating to me is that getting wrong answers is actually one of the
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.400]   most effective ways to learn something. Getting wrong answers on a test especially
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.000]   is one of the most effective ways to learn something. And I figured this out myself just
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.400]   through introspection before I heard the external research for it because I remember very specifically
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:13.360]   a test question that I got wrong in first grade. This is how deep a failure can go.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.240]   In first grade, my brother and I were being homeschooled by my grandmother. So,
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.760]   we would get up every day and we ride our bikes a couple miles down the road to my
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.960]   grandmother's house and we would do school underneath my grandmother. My family was all
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.320]   teachers. My grandmother was a teacher in her career. My mother was a teacher, etc.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:39.840]   And so, we had a very traditional structure because of this teaching background. And I remember that
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.200]   my grandmother gave me a test. And one of the questions on this test was, "How many digits
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:52.160]   are there?" First grade test. "How many digits are there?" And I sat there and I very carefully
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:59.280]   thought and I said, "Well, I know that there's not 10 digits because 10 is two digits put together.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.160]   So, I know that I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. There's 9 digits because I know
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.280]   that 10 is two numbers put together." So, I confidently wrote 9 on my paper. And I felt
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:18.240]   so proud of myself in first grade. I don't know why, but this emotion of pride is just written.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:24.000]   Actually, I didn't know why because I got it wrong. But I was so proud of my right answer
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.080]   that I figured out they were trying to trick me because they thought, because I had studied 1
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.200]   through 10, they thought I would put 10, that there's 10 digits and I know there's 9 digits
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:40.160]   because I know that 10 is not. So, I turned in my paper and I got it marked wrong because zero
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:48.880]   is a digit. I felt so humiliated. Here, I thought I was the smartest guy in the world. And here,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.360]   I thought that I had beat the test and they were trying to trick me. And it turns out that if I
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:30:00.560]   just put 10, I would have been right. However many years later from first grade, I still remember
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:08.480]   that one test question because I got it wrong. And to this day, I have always known that there
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:15.920]   are 10 digits in the world. That's it in our system anyway. This is life. We always remember
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.360]   the wrong questions. And so, one of the things that we need to do to learn effectively is basically
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.840]   start piling up as many wrong questions as possible. In language acquisition, one of the
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.800]   most valuable things about going out and speaking the language and using the language is you very
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.600]   quickly figure out which words you forgot, which words you don't know. And so, you're out in the
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.640]   world and you're trying to come up with a word and you say, "I should know what that is. How do
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.840]   I not know what the word for shoe is or door handle or whatever this is?" But you need it and
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.360]   you don't have it. Well, you go back, you look it up, you study it, you'll never forget it again
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.920]   because you got it wrong. And so, lessons come to us this way. And it's such a powerful belief
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.640]   to install in ourselves and to install in our children that every investment you make
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:07.680]   can have positive returns if you choose so. Number nine, every person you come across
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:15.360]   has a strong desire to feel validated. Every person you come across has a strong desire
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:22.800]   to feel validated. Again, magic key to interpersonal relationships. We're all
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.160]   longing for appreciation, for validation. And if you go out in the world offering that to people,
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:34.480]   appreciation, validation, you'll have friends everywhere. Now, I don't think that's a
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:41.280]   comprehensive list of all the belief systems that you need. I'm specifically avoiding giving you
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:48.240]   specific financial ones because I want you to create them for yourself. There are some very
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.800]   clearly financial belief systems that you can install. And if you let your mind go through
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:59.280]   the areas of income generation, expense reduction, investment returns, avoiding catastrophe,
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:06.880]   investing wisely, etc., excuse me, optimizing lifestyle, then you will discover how to build
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:17.360]   those beliefs. As you install into your operating system high-quality empowered beliefs,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   you will see nothing but opportunities. You'll see nothing but evidence to reinforce those beliefs.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:35.920]   I will give you one financial example. If you are ever offered a promotion at your work,
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.240]   if you're ever offered a significant increase in pay, you probably should take it.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:49.280]   Even if you don't stay in the job for a long time, you probably should take it
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:58.400]   because that promotion, that paycheck that you get will fundamentally transform how you view yourself.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:07.440]   Years ago, probably a Zig Ziglar tape, I don't know. I heard a motivational speaker that cited
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:15.280]   a study that someone had done, and they had taken a job description, a job offering,
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:23.520]   and they had put an ad in the newspaper, and they chose two comparable metro areas. I don't know,
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:29.760]   Chicago and New York. Who knows? Denver and Miami. I don't know. They ran this ad in two
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:38.000]   different cities. The actual words of the advertisement were identical. The job description,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.120]   the necessary qualifications, etc., identical for these two ads. The only thing that was different
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:51.360]   between them was the pay scale. For the sake of example, one was offering $120,000 and the other
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:34:02.160]   was offering $60,000. They received massive numbers of responses to the $60,000 ad,
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:11.120]   and they received many fewer responses to the $120,000 ad. The idea is that this little
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.680]   experiment demonstrated that people judge themselves not by their job qualifications,
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.800]   but by their salary level. The job qualifications were all the same. The description was the same.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   The necessary qualifications were the same. The only thing was that there were a lot fewer people
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.920]   that saw themselves as $120,000-a-year earners as compared to $60,000-a-year earners.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:40.000]   And I've seen this again and again and again in business, that it's very difficult to go and make
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.040]   an enormous jump in your income. It's very difficult to go from a $50,000-a-year job to
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.240]   a $250,000-a-year job, because when you're a $50,000-a-year earner, you see yourself as a
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.200]   $50,000-a-year earner. And if all of a sudden you make this enormous jump, your financial thermostat
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:01.120]   breaks. And in many ways, you look around and, "How do I sabotage myself quickly to get out of
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:09.280]   this because it's uncomfortable? I don't fit here." But once you become a $250,000-a-year earner,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.840]   you now are that person, and you see yourself that way. And a $250,000-a-year earner doesn't
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.880]   often wake up and say, "Let me go and apply for a $50,000-a-year job."
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.440]   The financial thermostat model has always been very powerful to me.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:32.560]   The example that I give is quite simply this. Let's imagine that, you know, my listener base
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:39.840]   varies enormously in terms of wealth and income, etc. But let's use a pretty good number.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.880]   Let's imagine that you woke up and you look in your bank account or your investment account,
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.200]   you look at your net worth statement, and you discover that you have a net worth today of
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:36:04.960]   $20 million. $20 million. How would you feel if you woke up and you looked in your bank
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.400]   statements and you discovered you had a net worth of $20 million?
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:16.480]   Now, most people would feel pretty good. They would say, "That'd be amazing to have $20 million."
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:23.680]   Now, I want you to imagine something different. I want you to imagine that—what name do I use?
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.920]   Donald Trump. I want you to imagine that Donald Trump wakes up today,
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:35.440]   and he has a meeting with his accountant. And the accountant says, "Mr. Trump,
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.760]   you're worth $20 million. That's your net worth, $20 million."
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:50.160]   How do you think Donald J. Trump would respond to that?
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:57.040]   Would he feel happy? Or would he freak out?
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.480]   You know the answer. How is it that two men could have
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:12.320]   very opposite reactions to the same facts? A $20 million net worth
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:20.400]   comes down to their belief system. If some guy's got a million-dollar net worth or a
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.880]   $500,000 net worth, and he wakes up with $20 million, he's going to feel great,
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.360]   because his belief system is, "Okay, I deserve $500,000 or a million dollars in net worth."
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.160]   But if a guy's got a belief system that, "I'm a billionaire, and I deserve to be a billionaire,"
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.120]   and he wakes up, and he's a multi-deca-millionaire—did I get my
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.960]   prefixes right?—20-millionaire, whatever, simplify it, then he's going to have a very different
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:54.800]   response. The point is simply to secure in your mind that your beliefs about yourself matter.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.920]   Now, I don't know if it is possible to make enormous changes in belief overnight.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:08.240]   I don't know if you can believe the secret, and you can just tell yourself, "I'm a billionaire,
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.000]   I'm a billionaire, I'm a billionaire," and somehow that's going to do something for you.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.560]   I don't think it does anything. I don't think it's possible, because I think that you could
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.120]   repeat every day, "I'm a billionaire, I'm a billionaire, I'm a billionaire," and you're
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.760]   not going to believe it, because you know you're not a billionaire. You're not even a millionaire.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.840]   I don't think it's possible to make enormous jumps, but I think it's possible to make modest
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:37.440]   and significant jumps. If you're earning $80,000 a year, then I think it's very believable that
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.880]   you could earn $105,000 a year, and then once you're earning $105,000 a year, I think it's
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.720]   very believable you could convince yourself that you're worth $140,000 a year, and once you're
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.760]   earning $140,000 a year, I think you can convince yourself that you're worth $200,000 a year.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.960]   And then once you're worth $200,000 a year, I think you can convince yourself you're worth
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:06.160]   $300,000 a year, and so on and so forth. So look for those things. You may not believe,
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.080]   for example, if you have a habit of yelling at people, you may not believe that you can
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.520]   become a non-yeller, but I think you can believe that you could yell less.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.440]   You may not believe that every person you come across has something to teach you,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.560]   but you could believe that most people you come across have something to teach you.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:34.000]   And the list goes on. The point is, go with what you can believe, but recognize that your
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.400]   beliefs are malleable, and it's up to you to set them, to establish them, to determine them,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:48.880]   and then to follow through. Be careful what you believe, because you're going to see,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.200]   in the world around, all of the things that you believe.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.960]   Be very, very careful with your beliefs.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:08.880]   Choose to adopt a set of beliefs that will serve you. And even if they're not guaranteed
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.880]   to give you the life that you want to live, choose a set of beliefs that are more likely
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:21.440]   to give you the life that you want to live. And what will happen is, in the fullness of time,
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:27.600]   your beliefs will determine your reality. So, choose wisely.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:35.600]   We all know that words have power, but there's one word that stands out, because when people say it,
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:44.400]   lives are changed. It's not a big word, but when you say it, the life of a kid like me can be
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:52.240]   changed. It's yes. Yes. Yes. Yes to becoming a monthly supporter of Shriners Hospitals for
