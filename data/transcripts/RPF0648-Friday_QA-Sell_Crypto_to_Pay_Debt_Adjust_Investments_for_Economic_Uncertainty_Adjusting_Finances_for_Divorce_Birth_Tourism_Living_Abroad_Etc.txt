[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.720]   My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today it's a live Q&A show.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.000]   These shows have been AWOL for about a month and a half, as I have been dealing with a colicky baby,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.340]   and helping my wife, and traveling quite a bit, and been kind of all over the place.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.940]   But I'm excited to bring them back, and hopefully they'll be back for good.

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.180]   My best of intentions are that each Friday I do a live Q&A.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.380]   If you're new to the show, I limit these shows to patrons of the show,
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.720]   which are people who sign up to support the show on Patreon.

[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.440]   I also have a number of written questions lined up from listeners of the show who just can't call in on the live schedule.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.940]   And so, if time allows, I will get to some of those.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.440]   A couple of interesting international questions lined up for when we get done with the live callers in today's show.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   I have some questions on what life is like if an American citizen moves abroad,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.580]   in terms of keeping their systems and their infrastructure in place in the United States.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.420]   And then also some questions on what happens if...
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.360]   for birth tourism, for an American citizen who's thinking about doing birth tourism.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.900]   But we begin with some of the live callers first. We go to James in Massachusetts.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.100]   James, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.780]   Joshua, I just want to say thank you for my wife and I and my son.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:35.020]   And honestly, you helped us convert a bit of this existential dread around finances into hope and action.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.720]   So, thanks for that.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:48.300]   So, my first question is, we paid off about almost $200,000 worth of debt in the last three years.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:57.600]   I would love to say it was through sort of just like using my income, but I made some investments, specifically cryptocurrency.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.340]   I work in the space and I made some investments a few years ago that paid off.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:13.900]   I took money out of the market and paid off about $125,000 worth of student loans and put down a down payment on a house.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.740]   The market went down. I kind of forgot about what I was still holding. Long story short, the market is back up.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:31.700]   We have about $50,000 worth of debt from still from actually the tax bill, which I didn't properly pay the first time I took money out.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.620]   My question is, we'd like to get the last chunk of money that we owe to creditors paid off.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:53.420]   And I don't know if I should take the remaining amount of cryptocurrency out of the market entirely at the risk of increasing my tax burden at the end of the year, or if I should use my income.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.620]   What is your household income?
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.380]   It is $190,000.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.660]   And household expenses?
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.740]   Household expenses are about $4,000 a month.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:16.740]   So if you paid off the $50,000 out of income, how long would it take you simply to cash flow that?
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.860]   I was hoping to do it within a year.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:36.860]   It should be $190,000 income take off expenses if you're spending somewhere in the range of $50,000 a year, then there should be enough wiggle room between $190,000 and $50,000 to pay it off in certainly less than a year unless I'm missing something or unless your estimates of income and expenses are woefully wrong.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.140]   With regard to cryptos, do you want to still be in the market?
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.140]   Would you be selling everything just for this?
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.540]   Or is this just kind of a, "Hey, I've got some profits. Should I take them and pay off the debt?"
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.820]   This is, well, I think they're good, relatively good holdings.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.500]   I have about $150,000 worth right now.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.380]   And I think they'll go up, but I also don't, I mean, it's so volatile.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.220]   I just really can't, I can't say for sure whether it's going to go up or not.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.060]   It could go to zero as well.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.860]   Of course.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.060]   So I just don't know.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.100]   I really want to be maxing out my 401k and doing other things.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.620]   I just kind of have a lot of balls up in the air in terms of where I should be prioritizing
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.140]   the assets I do have versus the income I have to tackle this goal.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.660]   Because we want to be out of debt.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.340]   That's our first goal.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.940]   And then we want to invest seriously starting from there.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:45.180]   And is the full 50,000 that you owe, is that all tax debt to the IRS or is it to various
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.660]   creditors?
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:54.700]   $40,000 is to the IRS and actually 38,000 as of yesterday, after a check I sent them.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.620]   And about 12,000 is a car loan.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.220]   And so, yeah.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.940]   Well, I mean, here's my thought.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.260]   In reality, there's not a clear financial answer to the picture.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.540]   The IRS debt is not charging you a high interest.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.940]   I'm going to assume also that your car debt is kind of just a modest interest rate.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.660]   So those things, those debts are not super dangerous, super expensive debts.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.260]   If the IRS debt is on a payment plan and if the car debt is on a payment plan, they'll
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.340]   just naturally pay off over time.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.340]   But if you and your wife feel like they're hanging over your head, then I would say it's
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.300]   good to clear them off, primarily for the emotional release of having them gone.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.060]   Because of your income, if you have been earning $190,000, if it looks like you can continue
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.540]   to earn $190,000, because of your income, I think that it's a relatively short-term
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.900]   plan either way.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.820]   If you kept these debts here and just simply lived on $4,000 a month and put everything
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.020]   extra against the debts, you would be debt-free in, you could do it in six months, right?
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.500]   Maybe a little more, a little less, but probably about six months.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.700]   If you pay, if you take cash out some crypto and write a check to the IRS and write a check
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:20.940]   to pay off the car loan, you can reinvest another $50,000 into the crypto market in
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.220]   another six months.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.300]   So it's not really, there's not a really compelling answer one way or the other.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.100]   If you told me, "I'm absolutely committed that I'm just going to let these debts pay
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.700]   off over time, but I'm going to keep investing on the side and stacking up cash and we're
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.940]   going to keep our income, our expenses really low and save a lot of money," I'd say, "Okay."
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.980]   Or if you said, "I'm going to go ahead and pay off the debt and then do it," I'd say,
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.620]   "Okay, there's nothing really compelling here."
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:50.300]   As long as you keep the ratio there of $190,000 of income to $50,000 of annual expenses, you've
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.580]   got an excess $100,000 of cash flow, which means that at these, I just assumed 40,000
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:02.300]   of taxes and then 100,000 of excess cash flow for the 150.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.300]   So as long as you keep that ratio, everything is good here.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.660]   Here's what I do like though about your going ahead and paying it off.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.700]   Three things.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.980]   Number one, if you have gains in the crypto, you know as well as I know that that market
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.740]   can be extremely volatile.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.940]   It may go up incredibly well, but it may also not go up.
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.220]   In general, due to our built-in fear of loss, I think we usually feel good when we take
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.620]   gains and do something meaningful with them.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:38.060]   Doing something like cashing out some of your portfolio to pay off debt would probably be
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.460]   a worthwhile thing so that if the markets evaporate and if you're wrong in your bets
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:49.660]   and all of a sudden your particular basket of crypto falls apart, then I think you'll
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.300]   at least be able to say, "Hey, at least we got out of debt."
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.260]   And I'm okay with that because you're not getting totally out of the market.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.100]   So if you've got $150,000 in your portfolio and you say, "I've still got $100,000,"
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.980]   there's still plenty of money in there for it to run if prices continue to increase.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.140]   But taking some profits and doing something that's going to impact your life is generally
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.940]   pretty good.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:14.620]   Number two, you've said in the conversation that paying off your debt is your number one
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.180]   goal.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.580]   And the wonderful thing about paying off debt as a number one goal is that it's clear.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.820]   And you've paid off so much debt in the last couple of years, regardless of how you got
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.780]   there, it doesn't matter.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.060]   You've paid off a lot of debt and there's just this last little bit hanging on.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.300]   So I say finish it off and enjoy the freedom of being debt-free.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.500]   Which brings me to number three.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.820]   If you are debt-free and you remain debt-free, I think that will open up your opportunities
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.620]   for investing and your career prospects.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.460]   If you're working in the crypto space, which is what I understood you to say, you know
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.220]   that's a very volatile market.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.500]   If I were in that situation, I would never want to be in a situation where I had to make
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.300]   monthly payments beyond a very basic level.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.220]   I would always keep myself in the position where my goal is to make a million dollars
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.860]   a year, but I want to be able to live on the income of a bag boy at the grocery store if
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.580]   I had to.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.660]   And the way to do that is to be debt-free.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.100]   So because you're in such a volatile market, I think there's a lot of value in being debt-free.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:19.340]   So for me, I say cash out the check, make sure you count enough to pay the taxes, do
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.980]   it in a tax-efficient way, but pay off the debt.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.660]   And then in six months you can replace it.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.020]   Stash the money in your 401ks.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.900]   You can do all that still.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.180]   There's plenty of time still this year to make those contributions.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.060]   That's my answer, James.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.620]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.380]   Any other follow-up questions before I go on to the next caller?
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.140]   I think I'll call in another time.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.060]   I'll get past this challenge first.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.340]   Congratulations on all the progress on paying off the debt.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.860]   And I'm tempted to derail the rest of the Q&A show and just talk about crypto.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.260]   My audience feels that I have ignored it and hopefully in the coming months I will stop
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.900]   ignoring it.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.700]   We're going to Chuck.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.420]   Chuck, welcome to the show.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.540]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:07.100]   Well, my question basically has to do with the money we have in 401k and IRS funds, IRA
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:13.740]   funds, and deciding where to keep that right now in the market with the major choices being
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:20.460]   between large cap equity stocks, bonds, and in their interest-earning cash equivalent
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.500]   within the plans we have available, given the market's kind of at a record high right
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:25.740]   now.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.540]   I just want to get your thoughts on it.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.980]   I know you don't have a crypto ball.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.220]   So do you have a financial advisor that you work with or are you a DIY investor?
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.940]   We do a lot of it.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.180]   Do you?
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.860]   I have financial advisors available through various plans that I'm in.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.540]   One of them is a state retirement plan.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.340]   I have three financial advisors I can talk to you through there.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:53.820]   But I guess my worldview and my wife's kind of aligns with yours and that the nation's
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.740]   debt and things like that you've talked about on other shows.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:04.700]   So I don't know that all the financial advisors necessarily take that into account.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.940]   So let me real quick just say one thing there.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:12.700]   I try to say this in any show I talk about with regard to things like national debt,
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:20.060]   et cetera, that I do not see a direct link between a discussion of something like national
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.140]   debt and the stock markets of a sovereign country.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.660]   I don't see that as a direct causal relationship.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.740]   In my thinking and in my research, I could see very well that the stock market measured
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:41.180]   in the whole could certainly continue to increase and do well even if a national government
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.140]   is not doing well.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.860]   And in fact, I think that you could make a good argument that actually could be the case.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.180]   Let me give you a simple example of a reasonable argument somebody could make.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:59.420]   It could be argued, if you buy a certain economic theory, it could be argued that if a government
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.500]   keeps taxes low, that can stimulate the economy.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.180]   That's a pretty decent argument.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.620]   And in fact, what you see is most governments generally believe that.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.700]   People in political parties will have certain theories that they will espouse.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.860]   They'll say, hey, we believe in high taxation.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.180]   But if you get into a situation where an economy is in recession and things are really
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:24.300]   struggling, you'll often see that various political parties will all vote either some
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.420]   loudly or some quietly for lower taxation.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:33.100]   When you have an opportunity for lower taxation, generally, you'll see a jump in company and
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.340]   corporate activity and you'll see a corresponding increase in stock prices.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.260]   Painting broadly, but that seems to be something that you can observe over time.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:48.620]   But that lower taxation could mean if a government doesn't cut spending to correspond to the
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.660]   lower taxation, that lower taxation could mean that a government would increase its
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.860]   deficit, thus increasing its national debt, thus leading in a worse direction.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:05.340]   So it's possible, I would say, it's possible for government finances to be heading in the
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.940]   wrong direction and it's possible for a stock market to be heading up.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:16.220]   So there's not a direct kind of causal correlation where I could say, I'm pretty confident that
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.100]   the US government in coming decades is going to effectively pass through bankruptcy.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.900]   I see that.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.540]   I believe that.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.220]   I don't see any way out of that.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.380]   But that doesn't mean that I think the stock market is going to crash this year or that
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.900]   doesn't mean that necessarily I think that every person with retirement accounts has
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.260]   to pull all their money out of the stock market.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.020]   So I see them as different.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.540]   I see them as related.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.700]   And I don't know exactly what will happen.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.540]   But the stock market question conversation is in some ways a little bit separate from
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.300]   the question of national debt.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:54.060]   I think you still have to rely at this point in time, I think you still have to rely on
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:01.420]   the basic practices of good financial management that are taught by the mainstream financial
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.700]   advice industry.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.140]   I think that it's good in your personal life to be wary.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:12.380]   So for example, I would have a, I would personally prefer to have a much higher level of cash
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.100]   available than probably many mainstream financial advisors would suggest.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:23.020]   That fits my way of saying that the best way to solve for the unknowns is to protect yourself.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.860]   Let me expand on that for a moment so it makes sense.
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.860]   I can't control what the stock market does and I can't control what a perfect portfolio
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.660]   can do.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.020]   But I can look at my own life and I can assess my own needs.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.140]   And I can assess the likelihood of certain events happening.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.580]   So it's possible that if I'm a really great financial theorist, I could design an ideal
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.460]   portfolio that could, that's going to suit through any, basically anything that could
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.340]   happen.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.340]   But for me, it seems more comfortable just to rely on the tools that I know, such as
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.740]   having instead of six months of cash in a bank account, to have a year or a couple years
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.260]   worth of cash in a bank account.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.860]   Because if I've got a couple years worth of cash in a bank account, then I can just, that's
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:08.780]   stable, then I can look at an investment portfolio that is dropping due to market conditions
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.220]   and say, I know a couple years is going to make a big difference here.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.180]   So I don't, I personally am uncomfortable with the extremist perspective of the dollar
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.900]   is going to zero, those markets are all going to crash, we should just put everything in
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.340]   cash or buy silver coins.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.780]   That doesn't, that doesn't click with what I see or what I have experienced.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:30.620]   But I'm probably more cautious than other financial advisors.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:35.340]   But I don't see necessarily that the way to solve that is with some special portfolio
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.340]   approach, but rather with a better understanding of personal finance.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.740]   So now let's talk about the most important question, which would be when you would do
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.180]   something with the money.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.380]   The basic advice is you have to look at your time horizon.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.460]   And I think that advice still holds true.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.260]   So in your case, Chuck, these are retirement assets.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.380]   When do you think you would start wanting to take money from these portfolios?
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.420]   We're both about 45 and we're wanting to retire around 55.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.380]   We're probably actually already in a financial position where we could do that now if we
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.220]   chose to, but we're running a business and the business is doing well and we like our
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:12.720]   work.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.180]   So we're going to continue for at least 10 more years.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.680]   Okay.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:25.820]   So your investments are, your assets are invested in retirement accounts that are in mutual
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.420]   funds, kind of mainstream mutual funds, and then in your business.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:34.220]   Do you have any other investment classes outside of those two basic investment classes?
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:40.860]   Yeah, as far as total assets go, we probably have about 30% in real estate that we own.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:47.580]   I'm talking outside of our house, investment properties, then office equity in our house.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:53.420]   And then we have retirement accounts and then we have enough cash on hand to, we probably
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.940]   pay our bills for a year or two years with cash on hand.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.940]   So in that case, I don't see any reason why you should adjust your stock portfolio to
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:10.780]   try to account for an unpredictable future in, for an unpredictable future in things
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.540]   like sovereign debt, et cetera.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:18.380]   If you're 45 years old and you think you might like to retire at 55, you have by definition
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.260]   the shortest time horizon you would have for these assets is going to be 10 years.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.820]   More likely these assets you would be, you would leave alone for at least 15 years.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.140]   So as not to trigger early, early distribution penalties on the money, since you have other
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.540]   cash, you have real estate and you have business.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.900]   My guess is you certainly wouldn't touch this until 59 and a half.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.700]   Although you could, as we've talked about in other shows, you could still use these
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.260]   as part of, as part of funding an early retirement.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:51.820]   So you've basically got a time horizon or time perspective of 15 years going out to
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:57.740]   your expected lifespan and at 45 years old, your and your wife's expected lifespan pushes
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.820]   out into the eighties or nineties, the older you get, the longer your expected lifespan.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.300]   So I would, my guess would be by the time you arrive at retirement age, your expected
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.940]   lifespan could very easily be 95.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:17.020]   So you've got about a, in that case, you've got a 15 to 15 to my math is failing me 40.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.940]   I'm not going to try it 15 to 45 year time horizon on these assets in these retirement
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.740]   accounts.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.260]   So this, you've got a long-term time perspective.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.260]   Now, the other magic words that you said was you have a business doing well, the business
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.420]   doing well means you're unlikely to have any need for cash unless the business goes down.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.060]   You're unlikely to have any need for cash in the coming years.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.660]   You have plenty of cash flow, so you're not going to be rating the investment assets.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.660]   You also said what's music to my, to my ears, you have a significant amount of money in
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.540]   real estate.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.540]   The thing I love about real estate is of course it has certain advantages, but one of the
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.940]   big advantages is it's close to you.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.700]   You can touch it, you can change it, you can see it, which is more likely to make you,
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.020]   in my opinion, a better stock investor to have a balance of things working out.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:07.900]   So from those facts, I wouldn't change anything about my investment portfolio just based upon
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:14.380]   the possibilities of, uh, of, you know, increasing government debt.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:19.820]   What I would do is I would keep my investment portfolio invested in the asset classes that
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:25.420]   are likely in the long term to have the highest rate of return, which would be in a heavily
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.540]   stock portfolio.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:32.380]   Unless you have a strategy where you're involved as an active manager and saying, I'm going
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.060]   to adjust my portfolio for the market conditions, I'm going to move in and out of investments,
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.140]   you're working with a financial advisor, something like that.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:45.020]   I would stay tilted towards a heavy stock portfolio and I would stay tilted for maximum
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.220]   growth in those accounts.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.420]   I wouldn't start to change and try to say, well, I'm going to try to predict this certain
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.620]   small change in the market.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.220]   I don't think it's necessary for you.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.460]   Okay.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.500]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.860]   It makes me feel better hearing you say that.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.420]   Good, good.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.220]   I guess rereading the national news every day just gets you concerned, but I appreciate
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.020]   your words on that.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.980]   Well, it's not that there's no reason to be concerned, but there is, and I'm trying to
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:16.300]   affirm there is reason for being concerned, but in your situation, I don't know what else
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.260]   you could do.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:24.940]   If you would be devastated by your stock market investments declining by 50%, then I would
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.940]   be concerned, but I don't think you're going to.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.060]   You have a successful business.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.140]   If you have enough money that you could retire now, you're clearly wealthy.
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.740]   You have money in real estate.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.100]   You have money in cash.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.740]   You might, I'm not sure if you've taken my how to survive and thrive during the coming
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.260]   economic crisis course, but I would commend that to you because we talked there a lot
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.140]   about offshoring.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.540]   I would make sure that I had a basket of currencies, that I had money offshore, that I had a plan
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.100]   to go offshore myself if necessary.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.740]   If we wind up in a place of severe and intensive economic crisis in the United States, which
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.500]   is less likely than almost any other country in the world, so we got to acknowledge it's
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.660]   a low probability scenario, but if that were to happen, I think your best solution,
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.020]   um, is to have money and assets positioned offshore.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.860]   You might adjust your portfolio a little bit.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.580]   So if you're, if you are happy with the stocks that you are, um, that you're, that you own,
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.820]   maybe fund your 401ks, but adjust it in another direction where you see things being better.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.420]   Maybe purchase some offshore real estate, maybe start another line of business.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.140]   Um, you know, make sure you have a portfolio of precious metals, make sure you have a portfolio
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.620]   of basic, um, you know, personal preparedness items, you know, food, things like that.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.060]   But in your case, a few checks and that's, that stuff is done and squared away.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.820]   So I think you're on the right track.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:41.020]   And at this point, I don't see any sense in the idea of just saying, oh, things could
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.820]   be bad for the next.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.580]   Here's my opinion.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.860]   I think fairly soon, I've been wrong on this so far, but I think fairly soon we'll go into,
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.220]   uh, recession.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.860]   There are many good reasons to think that'll happen.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.420]   Who knows how that works out with the timing of it.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.580]   And I'm convinced personally, the next recession will be long, deep and difficult, but that's
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:05.740]   not going to affect your retirement assets because 15 years to start pulling money is
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.940]   more than enough time for you to adjust to whatever happens three or four years from
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.420]   now.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.060]   If you were 65 years old saying, I'm going to quit working today, I would adjust in a
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.540]   different direction.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.940]   But in your case, I don't see the sensibility of it.
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.440]   Make sense.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.340]   And thanks for the recommendation on the course.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.620]   I think taking that course is a good idea and it's on my to-do list.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.220]   Yeah, it'll solve for you.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:33.660]   Listen, I wrote it myself and it's my answer to these questions.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.300]   And it's basically that I can't bring myself to go all in on disaster.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.340]   I think there's too much evidence that, uh, there's too much evidence that we should
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.740]   generally expect that things will in the long run get better.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.140]   If you, if you look on all sides, there's too much evidence to think that to just say,
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.540]   well, everything's just going to get worse and the world's going to wind up in global
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.180]   catastrophe.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.140]   I, that's hard to, that's hard to defend.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.060]   That's a really hard position to defend.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:05.020]   So I can't personally feel comfortable with this idea of I'm just going to go for the
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:11.180]   worst case scenario and take this uber pessimistic scenario situation that many people, um, take.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:17.260]   But on the flip side, I am uncomfortable with the incoherence of the, it, things are always
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.460]   rosy position.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.300]   You can't say that just because this has never happened in the past, it doesn't happen.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.580]   It's not going to happen again.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.540]   There are problems.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.300]   We all have personal problems.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.660]   There's a, you know, things can happen in our lives for all different reasons, just
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.340]   the mundane everyday problems.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.580]   And then there are big, major societally wide problems, et cetera.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.780]   I think that we are going to be living through in coming decades.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.820]   I think we're living through a long excruciating collapse of an empire in the United States
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.460]   of America, but that can't be brought over.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.620]   And as far as I can see, that can't be brought over to stock market advice.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.860]   And so when I say decades, maybe it starts, you know, maybe I think we're starting to
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.860]   be in it, but maybe it starts 30 years from now.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.980]   Maybe it starts 50 years from now.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.380]   Who knows?
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.340]   How do we even know?
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.340]   Anybody who's put times on these things has generally proven themselves to be wrong.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.820]   The game can continue far longer than any of us think.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:14.380]   So I'm stuck right in the middle, trying to be a realist and recognize that on the whole
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:20.060]   I should be optimistic because history is on the side of the optimists, but there are
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.940]   plenty of good examples to show me that in local circumstances and in specific periods
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.020]   of times, collapse happens.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:33.660]   Societies collapse, cultures collapse, money, currencies collapse, markets collapse, et
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.380]   cetera.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.260]   And so I look at it and say, how can I buy some insurance for this situation?
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.420]   I don't mind making some insurance payments.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.420]   If there's a way that I can make sure that the collapse would not be devastating to me
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:50.700]   without paying all of my wealth and the whole price to just move to a bunker in the woods,
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.460]   which I don't want to do.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.460]   So that's why I wrote the course.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.980]   It's basically a matter of how can you buy some insurance to protect yourself from economic
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:06.300]   crisis, be it personal or society-wide, and do that in a sensible way so that there's
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:11.500]   little downside to the whole plan if things just continue to be rosy, but there's a lot
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.700]   of upside if you wind up having a disaster scenario.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.620]   And I sleep better with that insurance.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:21.340]   Just like with any insurance policy, you basically sleep better and then you can stay focused
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.220]   on your business, your family, the things that you're building, and feel a little bit
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.660]   more insulated from any potential for catastrophe.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.180]   So I would commend it to you.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.540]   Any other questions, Chuck, before I move on?
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.940]   No, thank you.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.060]   Thank you for calling in.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.940]   We move on now to, looks like Lisa in Illinois.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.740]   Lisa, welcome to the show.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.620]   How can I serve you today?
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.620]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.100]   I'm so pleased that I got through and I'm glad to be talking to you.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.780]   I've listened to you for quite a long time.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:54.460]   So my question is, I have been married for 16 years.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:01.100]   I recently started my own business buying real estate and my husband and I are separated.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:08.140]   And so I took all of my money, which was about $10,000, and put it into this new real estate
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:14.220]   venture and we are separated, but I had to quit my job because I was sick for a long
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:14.720]   time.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:21.500]   I was working with disabled adults and the warehouse was making me sick, bottom line.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:28.300]   So I don't have a position right now, a job.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:35.420]   I was a certified retirement plan advisor and administrator.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.380]   So I could go back to that, but I think my land business will do okay.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.340]   I don't have much debt.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.780]   My question is, he has quite a bit of debt, probably over $60,000.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:54.940]   He does, his gross income is over $14,000 and mine was about $2,000 when I went into
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.700]   the non-for-profit sector.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:03.100]   So I'd like your thoughts on everything because I was very much into the investing,
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.660]   not necessarily a day trader.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.060]   I'm really risk adverse.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:16.300]   So everything I do is pretty much, I don't like credit cards.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.020]   I like to buy everything with cash, which is now a downside seeing that I have a business.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:27.180]   I use things like, I'm into privacy, so I use my pseudo for mail and everything, which
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.380]   is also difficult.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.860]   I'm staying with my daughter.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.780]   What would you recommend in my situation?
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.300]   When you say that your husband's income is $14,000, did you mean per month or per year?
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.380]   Per month.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:40.880]   Okay.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.860]   You mentioned your daughter, how old are your children?
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.460]   So I have three kids.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.780]   I have a 35, 32 and a 30 year old.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.740]   They're all on their own.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.860]   They're doing fine.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:29:00.460]   However, my middle child did take her life a few years ago.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.060]   Since then I've helped out quite a bit because she did come back.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.900]   And so she's not the same.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.540]   She's got a farm.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.460]   So I help out whenever I can over there.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.540]   So that was difficult.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.580]   And that's one of the reasons that I went into my own business so I could create passive
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   income and take care of those grandchildren.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.620]   What do you think will happen at this point in your marital relationship?
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.980]   And what do you want to happen?
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.900]   He's on the spectrum.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.260]   He's a genius, but he doesn't understand what a relationship is.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:37.500]   I hope that when he goes through butox and he becomes a different person, we can get
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.140]   back together.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.340]   I don't think he sees that.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:46.940]   And so right now he's wanting to only stay separated and not do a legal separation or
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.740]   legal divorce because of financial.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.180]   His brain only works the numbers.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.820]   He doesn't understand the personal side of it or the emotional side of it.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:01.180]   He's, it's hard to explain, but if you watch the imitation game, he's likened to
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:01.680]   that.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.100]   And so I could never explain to him about finances.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.340]   He thinks what I'm doing is being taken advantage of this business and everything.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:18.860]   So I'm not, he hasn't filed anything and I haven't filed anything.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:24.940]   We've lived apart now for a couple of months, but I would say the last three years we were
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.620]   emotionally apart.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.140]   Sadly.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.900]   How old are you and how old is your husband?
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.060]   Um, I'm 56.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.660]   He's 57.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.380]   And is your husband, the father of your children?
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:42.940]   Um, he is not, and he has his own son who lived with us and lives with him.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.220]   Who's also on the spectrum.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:54.380]   So in terms of the answer to your question, what are you, what, what, what specific
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.220]   questions do you have for me?
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.140]   Specifically?
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.580]   I mean, he's got a good pension.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.660]   I don't really know about, I mean, he, right now he pays for my insurance, my health insurance,
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.660]   which obviously is important right now.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.100]   And that was his, he said, you ran the numbers and it's better if he, we don't get legally
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:16.620]   separated or divorce because it'll benefit him later on because he's again, thinking
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.580]   of the numbers.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.900]   My question is, I did start a business.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.860]   I'm very private, but I'm trying to keep it as private as I can.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.140]   He said, by the way, when you do make a million, I will come after you.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:33.420]   I don't know if I'll ever make a million, but, um, I do own now, um, some properties
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.140]   and I'm buying and selling, um, to create the passive income so I can be around my grandchildren.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:46.060]   I'm not sure how much longer my daughter will be able to sustain a life without some assistance,
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:52.460]   but do I push for the divorce and get part of the pension and put, get rid of the debt
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:32:00.460]   that I do have and then, um, take care of the family or do I, because any debt he incurs
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.020]   now I will incur is that that's correct.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:07.180]   Even if we're living separately, if it's not legally separated and I, since I don't have
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:13.580]   credit cards and I don't like to incur debt, um, that's one of my worries as well, because
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.540]   he doesn't understand that he's not a bad person.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.180]   Right.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:17.680]   Right.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.580]   So let me give you some thoughts, a couple of ways to think about.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:30.540]   So I think first you have to separate the question of financial advice from the question
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.780]   of moral advice.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:38.460]   When you're dealing with divorce, separation, marriage, et cetera, you are in a territory
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.900]   where you have to start not by thinking about what's in my financial best interest, but
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.140]   you have to start by thinking about what is morally right.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.620]   What is the right thing for me to do?
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:57.980]   Now, with this, we go into the most difficult and touchy area of advice that anybody can
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.460]   get.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.020]   So here are some things that you need to watch out for.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:07.020]   The first thing that you need to think about is your, I'll just go, I'll take them in order,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.940]   not necessarily in order of importance.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:15.420]   The first thing you need to be aware of is what your life will look like if you continue
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.220]   to be married to him versus if you separate and divorce from him.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:26.620]   Very likely, the data would indicate, in my understanding of the data, if you divorce
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.340]   this man, you will likely never marry again.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.220]   So you need to consider if that is something that you are okay with or something that you
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.660]   are not okay with.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:42.460]   For women, as you grow older, if you divorce, it is very hard for an older woman to effectively
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.980]   and happily remarry.
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:50.220]   It is much easier for an older man to remarry when he is older because he can more easily
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.260]   attract and be attractive to a younger woman.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:59.740]   But it is much more difficult for a 56-year-old woman who divorces to be able to remarry.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:07.100]   In my opinion, women in your situation are often sold a false hope, a false dream.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.500]   The idea that, well, you are just going to be happier on your own.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.700]   That may be.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.980]   I have known a number of women who divorced in their 50s and they felt that they were
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.860]   happier.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:23.020]   But in general, there is this basic conceit that is sold to many divorced women that you
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:27.020]   will just be happier on your own when you can do it and you will find a better man.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.700]   The data does not bear that out.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.940]   That is not to say there cannot be exceptions to it, but the data in general does not bear
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.660]   that out.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:39.580]   So before you go and file for divorce, before you accept this separation and for this divorce,
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:46.060]   you should be very, very cautious to make sure that you are having a clear, unemotional
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.780]   understanding of the situation.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:54.780]   You also need to have a clear and unemotional analysis of the numbers involved.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:02.940]   Have you spoken to a divorce attorney or gotten any legal advice as to what would happen
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.460]   potentially for you in a divorce settlement?
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.900]   I do not have that information.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.420]   I did talk to somebody once.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:19.180]   There is some verbal abuse because he is on the spectrum, but that is not really what
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:19.740]   I wanted.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.780]   They basically said he would be paying you quite a bit per month and then you would get
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.580]   part of his pension.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:29.100]   But that is not necessarily what I am looking for.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:35.580]   I am looking for more of, you know, he does not understand debt or investments.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:42.140]   And so I could not get him to stop just understanding that you cannot just go out and spend money.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.860]   And so I was worried about that aspect of it.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:50.460]   But I really have not done a lot of digging for that and I do not really, I do not think
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.500]   either him or I at this point are going to be doing that.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:59.980]   So just to clarify, when you talk about his debt, you say that he owes $60,000 of debt.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.140]   Do you just mean like credit card debt, car debt or is that, tell me a little bit more
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.340]   about the financial situation.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.660]   That is pretty much credit card debt.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.940]   That is not including vehicles or phones.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:16.380]   And like I said, because he does not understand debt, if he needs something, he goes and gets
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:16.700]   it.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:24.620]   It is hard to explain when you are, he is so smart but yet, but he does not understand
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:29.900]   the principles of, for instance, I asked him once what he was invested if it was self-directed
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:35.420]   or if he, because it is a school, where the money, the platform was.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.140]   He said, I do not know.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.180]   And it took me about five minutes to look it up and I showed him and he goes, how did
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:39.740]   you find that?
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.020]   And I said, well, it is public knowledge.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.740]   And so, but he, that is how much he does not understand.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.140]   But so debt wise, if he, for instance, if you have eight mustards and you need one or
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.660]   if you need a new phone, you go get one, even if you could just fix the old one.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.700]   He does not understand it.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:02.300]   So, there is probably a lot more than 60, 60 is just the credit cards.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.860]   >> Okay.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.300]   But you said that he makes $14,000 a month, right?
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.580]   >> Correct.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.140]   >> Okay.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:15.340]   So, for somebody who is making $14,000 a month, which is $170,000 a year, $60,000 of credit
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.460]   card debt is not an unmanageable number.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.980]   I have seen, I have worked with people who make $30,000 a year of $60,000 of credit card
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.460]   debt.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.420]   So, I am not denying, hey, I would love it if nobody ever borrowed money.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:36.300]   I would love it if every single person, if every single person thought about every money
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.660]   they spent and went for the most frugal.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.740]   So, I would love that, but that is not reality.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:48.220]   Other than his having $60,000 of credit card debt, are there other serious financial problems?
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.220]   Are you or he behind on your bills?
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.940]   Are you in foreclosure, going into bankruptcy?
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.700]   Are there, is there a real serious tone to things or is it just the fact that he has
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.140]   $60,000 of credit card debt?
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:08.940]   >> No, and actually the finances, because, I mean, he does not have any savings.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:16.540]   I have more cash available than he does, but our problem was, are you asking about why
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.540]   we divorced or why we separated or are you asking about why he is very popular?
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.660]   >> Sure, tell me about it.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.580]   Tell me why you are separated from him.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:28.940]   >> So, he, because if you think about the imitation game, you know, someone that is
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:35.740]   that smart, there was a lot of verbal abuse and, you know, I did, I lived on my own basically
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.860]   in the same house and because he had his son there and they ate separately, everything
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.420]   was separate.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:46.620]   So, I was really on my own for pretty much our whole marriage.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.060]   And I mean, I am a Christian and I got him to go to church and he became a Christian
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:56.620]   and, but it was constantly, for instance, when my dad died, he went to work.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.020]   When my daughter died, he wanted to go home to get a sweater.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:04.140]   He does not understand those simple things and he would, if he did not take his medicine,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.100]   I would be thrown out.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.700]   I mean, it was very difficult.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.500]   I went through a lot.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.420]   >> Why did you marry?
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.940]   Why did you marry him?
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:19.740]   >> I loved him and I was with him and I said, you know, I am, I said, I am not going to
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.340]   move in with you unless we get married.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.380]   I am a Christian.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.740]   And at that time he said, we met on a blind date.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:33.260]   I had been through a really bad divorce with a very abusive husband and he was very kind
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.860]   and I did not realize that he was somebody different initially.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.460]   And like I said, I met him on a blind date.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.140]   He was really kind.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:46.540]   I had my own garden business and I was a day trader and I just gone through a really, I
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:52.060]   was stocked for a year and finally I met him at a blind date and it was almost instantly.
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.900]   He was very, very kind.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.860]   He was, he went and bought a bicycle cause he knew I went on bike rides.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.860]   I mean, he was just everything I needed him to be.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:05.820]   And then it was pretty much right away after we got married, his son moved in who was like
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.300]   Rain Man.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:12.300]   >> Has he committed adultery against you?
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.380]   >> I thought so.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.900]   I don't have any proof of that, but he was talking to people online, but I don't think
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:22.380]   he has.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.980]   He said he hasn't, but I don't know.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.540]   >> All right.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.500]   So here are some things that I think you should consider.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.700]   And I'm going to run through basically a list of things.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.460]   And I just encourage you to consider these.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.300]   You don't need to do anything with what I said other than consider it.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.700]   And probably the best thing would be for you to listen back after we finish the phone call.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:50.060]   Just listen to these things and consider them separately on your knees before the Lord and
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.900]   ask for discernment in a number of different things.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.900]   So first, let's talk about finances.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:06.140]   In what you've told me, I don't see anything that would indicate a reason for you to separate
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:14.460]   or to be really all that concerned about financial goings on in what you have described.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:20.700]   Almost nobody in the US American culture, aside from, I don't know the percentage, I
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.060]   would say it's got to be less than 20, maybe 10%, maybe 5%.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:29.820]   But almost nobody in the US American culture would be able to explain what a self-directed
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.020]   IRA is.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:37.580]   Almost nobody understands what a 401(k) means or what the differences between a 401(k) and
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.180]   a Roth IRA means.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:47.420]   Now you are interested in investing and you're interested in money.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.060]   And so for you, you're listening to a podcast like mine, which I commend you for and I love
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.780]   you for.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:57.500]   But a podcast like mine appeals to a tiny, tiny percentage of the population.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.540]   Most people don't care about money.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.980]   They're uninterested in the subject.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.820]   They don't care about being rich.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.620]   Most people want to simply enjoy today.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.900]   And from your husband's perspective, he's clearly very good at something to be earning
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.380]   $168,000 per year.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.300]   And he's very comfortable with the fact that he can earn all this money per month and he
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.740]   can have what he needs to have.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.900]   And by definition, if your husband wanted to pay off his credit card debt, he could
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.020]   pay it off in a year just out of his earned income.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.460]   He's not in bankruptcy.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.020]   He's not in severe financial problems.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.780]   He probably doesn't know how much money he even owes and he doesn't pay much attention
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.500]   to it.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.580]   Many people just simply don't care.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:43.980]   Now, if he's a little bit autistic or has some kind of mental just lack of connection
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.700]   or comfort with numbers, it's not at all surprising that he would just not be interested
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.180]   in it.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.940]   And many people just say, "Ignore it.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.220]   And as long as things can go okay, as long as I have enough money to pay the minimum
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.460]   payments, then things will go okay."
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.420]   I'm not denying that I would love it if he would be debt-free.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:05.100]   What I am denying is that what you've described to me is a financial emergency or catastrophe.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.780]   Is it ideal?
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.420]   No.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:13.260]   But is it a catastrophe or an emergency or is it in and of itself worth separating over
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.020]   or worth divorcing over?
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.660]   My answer is clearly no, it's not.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:22.780]   From what you've described to me, it's normal behavior for a huge percentage of the population.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.420]   It's not ideal, it's not going to lead to wealth, but it's normal behavior for a huge
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.820]   percentage of the population.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:39.420]   That's an important thing to recognize and to consider, is the financial questions.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.140]   Let's continue on the financial theme before we go to the moral theme.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:50.700]   So financially, you should think very carefully and probably solicit some good advice about
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.820]   the financial ramifications of divorce.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:44:01.180]   In your situation, I don't know that you have a very strong claim that would entitle you
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.580]   to a tremendous amount of money, tremendous alimony payments, etc.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:11.660]   Your children are grown adults and he is not their biological father.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:19.420]   So you and he married at a later age, which means that even with regard to his income,
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:24.700]   even with regard to his pension, it's not like you and he married when you were 16
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.700]   years old and now you're 55 years old and the judge would just automatically say, "Oh,
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.300]   well, you get 50% of his pension."
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.340]   It's not like that.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:35.900]   Which, by the way, the fact that he has a pension, using the word pension, is even another
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.300]   argument in favor of the fact that he's figured out how to get himself in a place where he
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.980]   can pretty much just live comfortably, not worry too much about money, and he's got
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.780]   retirement taken care of with his pension, so he probably doesn't think too much about
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:47.340]   it.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:52.460]   But I don't know that you, if you and he divorced, that you would walk away with $7,000
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.620]   a month of alimony payments and half of his pension.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:58.540]   In fact, I would not think that that would be the case.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.220]   I don't think that would be the case.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:08.540]   I think that in your particular situation, divorce would very much mean that financially
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:14.940]   that you are building largely with what you have and what you can build in and of yourself.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.580]   Now, you're a competent investor, you could learn more skills, you can develop things,
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.780]   and you can make tons of money.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:25.100]   But I wouldn't look, in your situation, of my understanding of the law, I would not
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:31.020]   look at divorce as some kind of golden check, that this would just solve all the financial
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:31.340]   problems.
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.620]   And by the way, let me be clear and affirm, you have not said that or indicated that in
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.340]   any way.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.740]   But it's certainly one of those things that has to be considered.
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:44.140]   But you haven't said that or indicated that in any way.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.460]   So I'm not accusing you of trying to pursue a divorce because you just want money.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.060]   That's not at all my accusation.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:54.380]   But I am trying to encourage you to take a good, hard, rational look at the facts and
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.820]   consider what they actually are.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:05.500]   So financially, in many ways, the best solution would probably be for you and he to stay married
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   and then for you and he to come up with an agreement about handling the finances.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.460]   If you are more well suited for these things like making investment decisions, if you're
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.940]   more well suited for managing the budget, for doing things like paying off debt, you
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:26.220]   could come up with some kind of arrangement that would leave you in a position of managing
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:32.220]   those details so that together, as a couple, together, you wind up together winning with
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:32.940]   money.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.660]   It's not that hard between your skills and his skills to pay off $60,000 of debt.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.220]   It's just not.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.740]   A couple years of work, sure, but it's not that hard.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:45.340]   But what would be required is the ability to communicate about it, the ability to work
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:50.380]   on a plan, the ability to find some kind of common goal, common purpose to where you're
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:55.340]   committed to it and you're willing to work at the difficult things, the difficult changes
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.780]   that would need to happen.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.020]   I would say that there are possibilities there.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:05.980]   From what you've said, it sounds to me like he's just more disinterested and he probably
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:11.740]   feels nagged and frustrated by your trying to help because it's not important to him.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.420]   He hasn't said, "Here's a clear goal that I have."
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.140]   He was probably pretty happy with how things were beforehand.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:21.100]   So financially, I would be very slow to encourage you to divorce.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:27.980]   Let me switch to what I think is more important than financially, and that is the moral decision.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:35.820]   I believe that in life, we often have to ask questions and understand what is right regardless
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.020]   of whether it is financially the better solution.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:43.260]   I could become a multimillionaire by becoming a criminal, but that would be the wrong thing
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:43.740]   to do.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.260]   We would all agree on that.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.580]   So in your situation, when you're dealing with something like moving from one job to
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:54.540]   another job, as long as the job in and of itself is not immoral, there's few moral considerations.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:00.060]   But when you're dealing with something like divorce, filing for divorce, that is an incredibly
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.380]   important thing to discuss.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:07.340]   You said that you are a Christian and that your husband is also some form of Christian,
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.860]   going to church, et cetera.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.140]   The Bible very clearly says, "God hates divorce."
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.580]   It's from the book of Malachi.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:19.420]   So we're dealing with something that is more momentous than almost anything else and more
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.780]   morally weighty.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:26.060]   And so you need to start your thinking and consideration, not with finances, not with
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:33.580]   budgeting, et cetera, but specifically what is morally right in your situation about divorce.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.180]   So I would hear it refer you primarily to your Bible.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.980]   Your Bible contains enough instruction that if you look at it and wait on your knees before
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:48.860]   the Lord and ask the Holy Spirit to show you clearly what the Bible says, you can see everything
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.620]   that you need to say there.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:56.540]   Now, I'm going to give you two things to consider, three positions basically to consider.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.900]   So here are the three positions that you can consider.
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:08.380]   The first position is what you will hear in much of modern mainstream Christianity, which
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:13.420]   basically looks exactly like the world around that says, "If you're unhappy in your relationship
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.580]   with your husband, if you are unhappy, then you can divorce him."
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.820]   That is profoundly unbiblical and unchristian.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.340]   It's absolutely wrong.
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:28.140]   And the people who would preach that, the people who teach that, they will suffer the
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:33.020]   consequences both now and in eternity for preaching that doctrine.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:37.660]   You see it already in many Christian churches, the erosive and corrosive effects of this.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:42.780]   But as a 56-year-old woman, when you're talking with your girlfriends, you need to understand
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:47.980]   that most of them, whether they self-identify as Christians or whether they self-identify
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.740]   as secular or whatever, most of them are going to ask you the question, they're going to
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.820]   say, "Lisa, what makes you happy?
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.820]   Do you think you'll be happier if you are together with your husband or do you think
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.380]   that you're happier if you're not together with him?"
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.820]   They'll say, "What makes you happy?"
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:08.140]   That thinking, if you are not very careful, that thinking will invade your thinking.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:13.900]   And I want to caution you that first, it's a very unstable way to make any kind of life
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.940]   decisions thinking about what would make you happy.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:22.380]   And second, I want to caution you that if you study the literature, notwithstanding
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.220]   the people who would say that, you will find that you will be in a very difficult position
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:31.900]   being a newly divorced 56-year-old woman trying to figure out how to form a new life.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:36.780]   So I completely disregard and I would encourage you to disregard that position, that kind
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:41.660]   of modern, general, liberal position that says, "Well, you should just decide what
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.860]   would make you happy."
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:46.060]   So let's go to what are biblical grounds for divorce.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.300]   Well, here there are basically two options.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.300]   I'm in a minority of this, so I'm going to begin with the majority position and then
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:58.060]   I'll get to my position and you will have to read your Bible and come to your own conviction
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.300]   about what is actually correct.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:07.580]   So the majority position among people who are serious Orthodox Christians is that there
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:13.420]   are either one or two reasons why a Christian can become divorced.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:20.300]   And those one or two reasons would be in the case of, number one, would be adultery, or
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.020]   number two would be abandonment.
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:29.420]   So the idea of abandonment is very, very hard, so I'm going to ignore it here, because it
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.900]   doesn't apply to your situation, and focus on just simply adultery.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:41.100]   If you take the mainstream Orthodox Christian perspective that is most common, the mainstream
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:47.100]   Orthodox Christian perspective would say that the only reason why you would be biblically
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:52.140]   permitted to divorce your husband would be if he has committed adultery against you.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:56.380]   In what you said, you said, "I don't think so," or "I don't have any evidence that he
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:57.020]   has."
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:02.140]   And so on that basis, you have no biblical grounds to file for divorce.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.940]   I understand that I don't, and I don't think we should discuss such things publicly here,
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.180]   it's best in a private setting.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:17.260]   I understand that something like what you term to be "verbal abuse" can be very painful.
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:26.060]   I understand that being in a house where your husband has a child by another woman, and
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:31.980]   you feel unloved and uncared for, I understand that those things are intensely difficult
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.020]   and emotionally draining and painful.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:39.180]   But they are not biblical qualifications for divorce.
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:45.500]   The biblical qualification that many people believe exists for divorce is only adultery.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:52.060]   So in that case, you cannot, if you take that position, you cannot divorce your husband
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:55.180]   because he has not, you don't have any grounds for divorce.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:59.260]   Now you could legally do it in the United States today, you can divorce for any reason
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.580]   whatsoever, you don't have to give any reason.
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:06.940]   But morally, when you stand before God, you have no moral basis for divorce.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.700]   And you need to take that seriously.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.740]   I don't know anything about the makeup of your church or what advice you're getting
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:18.860]   from pastors or preachers, but it's extremely important for you to recognize because you
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.020]   can't stand before God on the basis of what anybody else tells you.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.060]   You can't stand on the basis and say, "Well, my preacher told me such and such."
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:30.460]   You have to stand before God based upon the conviction of the Holy Spirit and the clear
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.900]   teaching of scripture.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:37.340]   Now, the reason I said that that's the majority position, let me go on now to my personal
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.380]   position.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:44.140]   I do not believe that there is any legal or moral justification for divorce, and I would
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.820]   say that based upon the clear teachings of Jesus.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:54.780]   If you believe that Jesus taught a standard that superseded the Mosaic standard, which
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:54:00.380]   is what I believe, then I would say there is no basis for divorce, for any person to
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.340]   divorce.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:07.420]   And any concession for divorce that occurred in the Old Testament was a concession for
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:13.260]   the sin of the Jews, and that was the reason why there was a Mosaic concession for divorce.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.820]   But if you go and you read the teaching of Jesus, you will find that he clearly says,
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:24.540]   when asked by the Pharisees if it was permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason,
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:29.580]   you will clearly find that he says, "Moses allowed it, but I say to you that from the
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.940]   beginning it was not so."
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:35.820]   So I believe that man has no influence over marriage.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.620]   Man can create laws about marriage.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:43.500]   Man can say that you can marry this certain person or you can divorce under these circumstances,
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.260]   just like the US government can say.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:51.420]   The US government can say that black people and white people can't marry each other,
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.380]   but that doesn't mean that God says black people and white people can't marry each
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:54.860]   other.
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:58.540]   The US government can say that you can only divorce in case of adultery, or then the
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:01.820]   US government can change its law and say, "Well, you can divorce for any reason."
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.540]   The US government can say that a man and a man can marry each other.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.260]   The US government can say a man and a woman and a woman can marry each other.
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:12.460]   None of those things mean anything other than individual people trying to exert power and
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.140]   coercion over other people.
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.620]   That doesn't mean that it is morally right.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:20.540]   So in the teachings of Jesus, what I would encourage you, this is my opinion, I'm trying
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.980]   to acknowledge that it's a minority opinion, but I believe it's the opinion that's true
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.740]   to Scripture.
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:29.340]   I believe that men and women are married based upon what they do.
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.860]   God said, "Let a man leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife."
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:38.220]   And what man joins together, what God joins together, let not man separate.
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.420]   So I don't see any place for divorce whatsoever.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.700]   So you have to, you need to go back to the Bible, you need to think very, very carefully.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:53.260]   Now, I want to point out for the sake of clarity that this is complicated because you are already
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:57.180]   married again when you were already married once.
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.700]   And so that's even more difficult, which brings me to the next thing.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:05.900]   Biblically, if you are going to be faithful, whether to the clear teachings of the Scripture,
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:11.900]   whether or not you take the majority opinion or whether you take my opinion, if you do
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.420]   divorce this man, you can't biblically remarry.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:19.980]   The Scripture very clearly teaches that remarriage is adultery.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:25.900]   So I would say that when you married your current husband, you committed adultery against
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.260]   your first husband.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.100]   And that was the major error.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:33.900]   And what you've seen in the relationships with your children, the relationships with
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.380]   his children, you've seen the devastating impacts of that and are experiencing the pain
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.180]   of it.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:46.300]   But pain is, you're not in a hopeless situation, but what you need is not financial advice,
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:51.180]   you need to find somebody locally who can sit with you, who can encourage you, and who
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:56.460]   can be straight with you and sit and study the Scripture and get a clear direction from
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:01.020]   the Lord based upon Scripture as to what is the right thing to do.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:05.660]   And I'm not in a position, of course, here in this situation to do that.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:12.700]   But if I were you, obviously I'm encouraging you and I care for you greatly, I would simply
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:17.260]   say there isn't a financial answer to your question.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:23.260]   Because even if it costs you everything to do what is morally right, you should still
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:23.900]   do it.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.340]   You cannot serve God and money.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.820]   One of them will have to be higher over the other.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:33.980]   So even if it costs you everything to do what is right, you should still do what is right.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.220]   But you shouldn't think about money at this point in time.
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:42.380]   You should be on your knees and think about what is right, what is the right thing to
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:42.940]   do.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:47.740]   And when you come to a place of clear conviction where the Holy Spirit speaks to you and you
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:52.460]   see very clearly written in the Scripture the confirmation of that, when you see very
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:58.300]   clearly that, then I would say set your course to do what is morally right, no matter the
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.260]   cost, and then we can figure out the finances as they come along.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:04.700]   So, I can't give you any other answer than that.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.460]   I understand that may or may not be what you were looking for, but that's my answer,
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:11.340]   Lisa, of some things for you to consider in this situation.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:15.420]   Lisa: I would say that's the best advice I've heard yet.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.020]   Pete: [Laughter] Good.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:23.820]   I'm gonna, I'll end the call with you here, but I would encourage you, feel free, obviously
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:24.780]   I'm not close there.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:29.260]   These things I think are too sensitive and too important to be talked about publicly.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:35.020]   So, I would first, I would encourage you to people in your community to, if you're part
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:40.540]   of a church, I would encourage you to speak to the pastors in your church, the elders
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.620]   in your church, open yourself up to them.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:48.140]   Look in your friends, try to find a community if you have friends, family members, things
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.060]   like that, people who are serious.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.220]   I would warn you, I wish I didn't have to make this warning, but I would warn you, you
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:59:00.700]   will not find very many people who are willing to actually be straight with you and who are
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.980]   willing to actually be straight with what the scripture says.
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:11.420]   The scripture in and of itself is crystal clear, but you very rarely will hear it preached.
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:16.460]   And so, if you're in a, you know, just a good question would be, if you are in a church
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:21.580]   community and there's a man or a woman who is in that church community who divorced their
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:26.940]   spouse for any reason except adultery and/or abandonment, and they weren't excommunicated
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.340]   by that church community, you should tread very carefully.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.860]   So, there are plenty of people available, but they are going to be challenging for you
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:35.180]   to find.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.860]   It's going to be fine for, doing what I'm doing, speaking to you straight is very difficult
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:40.540]   for most of us in the modern world.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:46.860]   So, feel free to write to me by email and I'd be happy to encourage you as I can, but
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.860]   I'm just going to send you to somebody in your local community who can pray with you,
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:55.580]   who can search the scriptures with you, and I encourage you, do the bare minimum to survive
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.220]   financially.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.020]   Just, you know, make enough money to survive.
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:02.540]   Go live with your daughter if you need to encourage her, but do the bare minimum that
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:08.700]   you need to do to survive and focus on understanding what's right and then just make the finances
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.340]   fit that.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:14.140]   But I think that's as far as we should go with any kind of public conversation here.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:14.640]   - Thank you.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.500]   - My pleasure.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.140]   - Thank you.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:20.380]   - That was the last of our live callers for today, but I have two more questions that
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:25.740]   were written in by patrons that are both interesting and international in scope.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:29.740]   The first one is going to be the simpler one and then the second one will be interesting.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.460]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.580]   The second one's on birth tourism.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.540]   So, we begin, Muhammad writes in and asks this question.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:39.820]   It says, "What are the logistics of having my investments in the United States if I am
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:44.780]   no longer a US resident, but still a US citizen?
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:50.220]   I want to live in Spain for the next few years and I would become a resident of Spain.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.980]   Would I still be allowed to have bank accounts and investments in the US?
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.100]   Gracias."
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:01.580]   Well, Muhammad, in this case, in some ways, you are in luck as a US citizen because the
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:08.300]   requirements for US citizens are much simpler than they are for the majority of residents.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.620]   And I'm assuming that we're going to talk about taxes.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.460]   So, I guess I shouldn't make that assumption.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.420]   So, let me clarify first.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:19.900]   And I'll use Canada and the United States because they're geographically close and yet
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.900]   they give me the distinctions that I want to make.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:27.660]   So, if you were a Canadian citizen living in Canada who desired to move to Spain, but
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:33.740]   if all of your investment life were in Canada, you would be in a situation where you could
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.380]   just simply move to Spain and keep all of your situation in Canada.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.740]   You wouldn't have to make any changes.
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:43.420]   And this is the same for any person from any nation.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:47.020]   You can leave a nation and keep everything in place.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:53.020]   Now, if you were a Canadian citizen and resident who was looking to move to Spain and become
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:59.900]   a resident of Spain, and if you were trying to disentangle yourself from the Canadian
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:06.140]   tax system, from owing the Canadian government money on your taxes, on your worldwide income,
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:12.860]   from paying for the various Canadian social programs, insurance programs, et cetera, in
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:18.060]   that situation, in order for you to successfully extricate yourself from Canada, you would
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.820]   have to do two basic things.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:26.380]   You would have to move to a new place, in your case, obviously, Spain, and you would
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:32.380]   have to sever all of your ties with Canada, which would mean you would have to move your
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:36.940]   investments, you would have to close your credit cards, close your bank accounts, you
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:40.380]   would probably need to sell any property that you own in Canada.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:45.180]   You would need to, in order to fully extricate yourself from Canada and to prove that so
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.780]   you could stop dealing with the Canadian government, you would need to sever all of
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.620]   your ties with Canada.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:56.060]   Now, in some ways, this is an advantage and a disadvantage between US Americans and Canadians,
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:03.180]   because you could ultimately and fully sever your relationship with Canada by doing those
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:03.500]   things.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.860]   And frankly, as a US American, I get a little bit envious of that situation, because there
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.620]   are many times where I'd like to sever all of my relationships with the United States
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:19.100]   of America, I'd like to extricate myself from the tax net, from the other duties and
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.940]   obligations that are imposed upon US Americans no matter where they live, I'd like to sever
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:26.540]   myself from those things, but I'd still like to keep the option to be able to go back to
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.260]   the United States to keep my US passport, etc.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:33.660]   Well, you could do that if you were Canadian, but you would have to fully cut yourself off
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.060]   when moving to Spain if you were trying to get out of that.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.380]   Now, as a US citizen, things are far simpler for what you're describing.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:47.900]   And they are simpler because you cannot extricate yourself from the US government unless you
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.540]   formally renounce your citizenship, and you're not going to do that.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.980]   You didn't say you're going to do that, and in fact, we'll touch on even if you did
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.580]   choose to do that in just a moment.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:04:03.340]   So as a US citizen, there is only basically one benefit that you can get by physically
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:08.620]   moving yourself outside of the United States, and that is the foreign earned income exclusion
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:17.660]   and its neighbor or friend, accompanying friend, the foreign housing deduction or exclusion.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.140]   So that's it, the foreign earned income exclusion.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:25.580]   And the only thing that that can do is that can qualify you to avoid the federal income
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:30.220]   taxes on the first about $105,000 of your earned income.
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:36.460]   With everything else, your relationship with the US government is going to be about the
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:42.540]   same whether you're living in Kansas City, Kansas, or whether you're living in Madrid,
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:42.940]   Spain.
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:46.140]   You're going to have to file a tax return every year.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.860]   You're going to have to file a couple extra forms.
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.380]   In fact, your life will be a little bit more complicated if you do foreign banking, foreign
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.500]   investments, et cetera.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.740]   But your relationship isn't going to change.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:05:01.740]   The US government is going to see you as having the full obligations to them no matter where
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.940]   in the world you live.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:09.020]   So what this means, however, is it's purely based upon your physical location and whether
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:12.380]   or not you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.100]   Now, there are two ways to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.260]   You can qualify based upon the strict days test, which means that you spend at least
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:24.140]   330 days outside of the borders of the United States and inside the borders of another place.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.820]   And if you do that, you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:35.500]   Or if you're trying to qualify for it based upon the substantial presence test, then that's
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.780]   a little more complex and you might have to rent out your house in the United States,
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:39.820]   buy a house in Spain, et cetera.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.180]   So let me just keep things really simple.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:46.620]   If you want to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion by living in Spain, you just
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:51.100]   need to make sure that you spend 330 days in some country other than the United States.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:57.180]   And if you do that, you'll be in a situation where you can avoid the income taxation on
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.340]   your first $105,000 of income.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:04.540]   But everything else in your life can stay exactly the same as a US American.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.780]   All of your investment accounts stays the same.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.820]   Nothing changes.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.340]   All of your bank accounts stay the same.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.140]   Nothing changes.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.300]   All your credit card accounts, everything is the same.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:21.820]   Nothing is different with the United States because you are abroad other than that foreign
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.020]   earned income exclusion.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.660]   You may or may not care about that depending on whether you're working in Spain.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.580]   If you're not working in Spain, just come and go as much as you want.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.940]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.260]   Now, you will still have then the consideration of your obligations and your relationship
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.060]   with the Spanish government, which you will need to think about.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.500]   How much time you're going to be in Spain?
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.620]   Are you going to get a residency, which can expose you to taxation?
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.860]   Are you going to go that path or are you going to do some other plan?
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:43.820]   That's up to you.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.180]   But with regard to the United States, nothing has to change.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.700]   And here's what's interesting.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.620]   You could do this for decades.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.220]   You can bank in the United States.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.580]   You can invest in the United States.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.660]   You can not nothing needs to change.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.700]   Let's go to that ultimate thing.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.780]   What if you ever renounced your citizenship?
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:03.180]   What's remarkable is even if you renounce your citizenship with the United States, you
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.420]   can actually continue most of those things.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.260]   Nothing actually has to change with your investments, your banking, etc.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:12.460]   Even if you ultimately renounce your citizenship, you would keep your social
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.020]   security number.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.860]   You're still eligible for Social Security benefits.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:20.940]   The cost of renouncing your citizenship is, of course, possibly exit taxes, the cost of
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:24.380]   the actual renunciation and the fact that you can never get it back and you can't come
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.980]   to the United States as a citizen.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.700]   You would have to come on a visa or something elsewhere.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:33.820]   But on this basis, it's actually quite interesting that Americans, US Americans have it easier
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.220]   than most other places.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:41.420]   Australians, Germans, Brits, Canadians, Mexicans.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.380]   You've got to sever your ties with your home country.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.980]   And every country has a different process.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:50.780]   And then you can never actually quite know if you are fully gone.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:55.980]   And that's what's so dangerous is it's possible that you could say, let's say you're
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.700]   from the UK and you lived in London for years, then you decided to move away from London.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:08.940]   Well, you could go through all the steps recommended by the British government.
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:13.180]   But if they came back five years later and did an audit of you and found out that in
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:19.580]   some way you were still you still had some ties to Britain, it's possible they could
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.860]   actually impose taxes for all those years.
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:27.340]   So it can be not quite as clear for someone else to separate themselves.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.740]   And so the safest thing that most of those people have to do is they have to fully sever
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.940]   all of their connections.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:37.740]   As I said, move investments, close accounts, close credit cards, et cetera.
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.740]   For US Americans, it's far simpler.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.660]   You can keep everything in the United States.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.900]   And there are only two things that you need to consider.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.940]   Number one, physically, where is your physical body located for the majority of the year?
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:53.340]   And for simplicity's sake, are you physically outside of the United States for at least
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.180]   330 days per year?
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.540]   Number two, the question then is citizenship renunciation.
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.860]   And you can't renounce accidentally.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.860]   It's a formal process with a formal oath.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.260]   And so you have a paper that says you've renounced.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.860]   If you've renounced, you file your final tax return and you're done with the US government
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.740]   in that regard.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:13.260]   So it's much simpler for Americans.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.020]   So I hope you enjoy your time in Spain.
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.500]   But thankfully, you don't have to change anything.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.140]   You can keep everything exactly as it is.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:26.540]   Which now brings me to the last question of today submitted by a patron of the show who
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.620]   basically writes in and says, "Joshua, time zones are going to prevent my attendance on
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:35.100]   the Q&A show, but I'd love to hear your advice on how to research birth tourism that can
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:41.660]   lead to second passports, not only for our upcoming baby, but also for my wife and for
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.220]   me.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:48.460]   My wife is pregnant and our insurance encourages an expat birth because it's usually cheaper.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:53.740]   So we have the financial angle covered, but we are unsure how to research the legal or
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.780]   immigration angle.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:10:00.300]   Birthright citizenship countries are easy enough to find, but of those 30-ish options,
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:05.660]   I'm having a hard time tracking down whether I can get citizenship myself via the child
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.420]   who gets it via birthright.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.140]   I'd love any help or advice or pointers."
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:14.700]   And I responded, because this was in writing, I responded with a clarifying question and
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.260]   I asked the listener whether he was in a position where he was just looking to go abroad for
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.940]   the birth and then come back home quickly or whether he's willing to move to another
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.100]   country as well.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.380]   And he responded, he says, "Our thought is that we'd more like to take something like
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:33.180]   a month-long trip for the birth itself, but we could probably swing another month if it
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.780]   enabled a second passport.
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.340]   We could probably swing renting a place to establish residency and maybe one visit a
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.700]   year, but we aren't in a financial position where buying property would make sense.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:49.100]   We are US citizens currently living in Asia, but not in a country that offers birthright
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:49.740]   citizenship.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:55.340]   Of course, if we were in the Asia region, then it would be simpler for us to visit more
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:00.460]   frequently, but even then we can't move to a new place, even semi-permanently."
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:06.780]   So I'm going to do my best to give a useful, abbreviated answer to this question.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.980]   I'm going to target 20 to 30 minutes and you can laugh if I go to an hour or not.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:16.380]   I actually have quite an extensive outline to this question prepared in all of my outlines.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.660]   I could do a whole show on it.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.180]   I thought about actually creating a course on this, because it's something of interest
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:21.820]   to me.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.340]   It's something that I have done.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.020]   It's something that I have put a lot of time and thought into.
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:32.460]   And so I have a lot to say on it, but I'm going to try to keep it abbreviated here for
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.580]   the benefit of this listener who is a patron of mine.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:41.740]   So quick background for all listeners and then background for listeners who are considering
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.300]   doing this.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:48.300]   What this listener is talking about is the concept of birthright citizenship.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:56.060]   The technical theory, the legal theory here is called jus soli, which is basically the
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.100]   right of the soil.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:02.700]   And the idea is that if you are born in a certain geographic location, the sovereign
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:09.340]   government that claims sovereignty over that geographic location is willing to confer upon
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:14.540]   you citizenship of that nation because of the location of your birth.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:19.740]   This is contrasted against the doctrine of what's called, was it just sanguinis, or
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:24.060]   basically the right of the blood, which means that if you are born to a parent who is a
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:29.900]   citizen of a certain country, then you can be eligible for the citizenship of that country
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.900]   of your parents' citizenship because you come from that bloodline.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.540]   Now, there's a marked distinction in the world between these two different legal theories.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:46.540]   Much of the old world, including Europe, much of Africa and Asia, much of the old world
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.700]   goes by the theory of the blood.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:53.980]   So if you are British, born to British parents, the British government looks to see are your
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.300]   parents British, not exclusively were you born in Britain.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.420]   If you can, in this situation, or in Asia as well.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:06.140]   So if this, let's pretend this listener is living in China, but yet they're American
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:06.620]   citizens.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:11.580]   So two American citizens can be living in China and can have a baby in China, and they'll
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:16.780]   be able to have the baby, but the baby will not be a Chinese citizen just because it is
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.300]   born in China.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:23.500]   Whereas two Chinese parents could be living in the United States, not being citizens of
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.900]   the United States, but if the baby is born in the United States, the baby will automatically
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:32.140]   be considered a US citizen because it's born in the United States.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:38.860]   So there are 30-ish countries in the world that without regard to the parent's citizenship,
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:44.220]   they will confer citizenship upon the child that's born in their national territory.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:50.140]   And most of those 30-ish countries are in the Americas and in the Caribbean, the so-called
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:50.700]   New World.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:55.340]   So the idea here is where should you have your baby?
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.260]   What's an intelligent place to have your baby?
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:03.020]   And if you can give your child a second citizenship by birth, then why should you not do that?
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:09.180]   If you can go and have your baby in Canada as an American, and your baby is automatically
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:13.420]   then a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, well, then you can move right back
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.220]   to the United States.
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:17.980]   And as I just said, your baby will actually really have very little relationship with
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.780]   the Canadian government.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:24.220]   They're not going to be subject to taxation, et cetera, just because they were born there.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.220]   They can have a Canadian passport though and be a Canadian citizen, and they can always
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.100]   enjoy those benefits even if they never live in Canada.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.260]   And there's a list that goes around on the internet of about 29 countries.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.020]   I think, I'm not sure who started this list.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.740]   I think it was probably Andrew Henderson at Nomad Capitalist, but there's basically the
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.220]   same list.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:47.100]   You see it repeated on every site.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:53.980]   Where I would send you would be to start with a Wikipedia article at wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_solide.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:59.820]   J-U-S underscore Soli, S-O-L-I-D, where it talks about the different kinds of just solely
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.700]   which are unrestricted just solely and gives a bunch of countries and restricted just solely.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:08.940]   Now, I don't know if every one of these countries exactly is correct.
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:13.340]   It's probably, the Wikipedia article is probably pretty good, but when you're dealing with
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:19.260]   what, almost 200 sovereign states or whatever, it's a little challenging to keep on track
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:20.700]   of all those laws.
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:24.780]   But let's talk about what you would do first, and then I'll give you some ideas on different
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.340]   countries.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.780]   What are the benefits of having a baby abroad?
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:33.660]   Well, I think the benefits come into basically two categories, possibly three if you have
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:34.780]   other children.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.060]   So the first is, what are the benefits for the baby?
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:44.140]   If you go to a country that will confer citizenship on a child that's born within its geographic
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.420]   borders, that baby will have certain benefits.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:51.580]   That baby will have the benefits of citizenship of that country.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.460]   So what are those benefits that are the most important?
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:16:02.220]   In my mind, the first obvious benefit is the ability to live in that country and to work
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.420]   there as a person who's in that country.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:12.060]   If you think about the concept of citizenship, about the only ultimate right that citizenship
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:18.620]   confers is the legal right to live within certain geographic boundaries of a sovereign
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:19.180]   government.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:20.220]   That's about it.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.820]   That's the basic right.
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:28.620]   Now, depending on the government, there may be other benefits, but that's the basic right,
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:32.380]   the ability to live and work in a certain place.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:36.620]   And so if you're going to get that, you have to think about what's going to be in the best
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.980]   interest of this baby.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.100]   Give an example.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:45.580]   One of the countries that has a citizenship of the soil, just Sali, is the country of
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:46.220]   Tuvalu.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:53.180]   Now, I don't know how familiar you are with the country of Tuvalu, but it is a tiny little
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:59.340]   island nation down in the Pacific, and its total landmass is about 10 square miles.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:04.460]   It's just a long, thin strip, not that long, but about 10 square miles.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.620]   And there are, I think, how many people live there?
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:18.380]   11,000, about 11,000 people who live on the island of Tuvalu, and they have a GDP of just
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:26.780]   under $40 million, basically, of total GDP for the country, or about $3,500 of GDP per
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.820]   capita, per person.
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:33.980]   So if you go to Tuvalu and have your baby in Tuvalu, your baby is going to be legitimately
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.300]   proven by the constitution of Tuvalu.
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:40.300]   Your baby is going to be, what do you call it, Tuvaluan, I think?
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:40.940]   Tuvaluan?
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:47.740]   But the question is, how big of a benefit is that going to be to your baby?
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:52.460]   Well, if the benefit is a place to live, it's probably not a great benefit.
[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:56.380]   I'm sure Tuvalu is very nice, but it's not exactly a big place.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:02.620]   And if the benefit is economic opportunity, it's probably not that big of a place where
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.300]   there's a lot of economic opportunity.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:10.300]   So that might not be really a huge benefit for your child.
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:17.420]   Now, if you were to compare that with a country like Canada or the United States, of course,
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:23.340]   you're already American, so we can skip the United States largely, or Mexico, or maybe
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:32.140]   Panama, or Chile, or Colombia, or Brazil, all of these countries offer birthright citizenship.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:38.300]   But compared to Tuvalu, they are huge countries, which provide massive geographic area in which
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:43.420]   your baby can live, and a massive economy in which your baby can participate.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:48.380]   If you have a baby in Mexico, there are many, many more economic opportunities available
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.020]   to your child than if you have your baby in Tuvalu.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:53.980]   So you need to think about, what are the benefits that I'm trying to get for my baby?
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:58.220]   And think about, well, I'm trying to give my baby a place that they can legally live
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.300]   and a place that they can legally work.
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.300]   Now, the obvious solution here, of course, is the United States.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:07.340]   But since you're US Americans, you already have that you can already confer upon your
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:12.780]   child US citizenship, because you are US American parents, no matter where they're born.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:18.860]   And so what else, what other place would be in the benefit or the interest of that child?
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:22.780]   Now, when you're thinking about access to live and work in a place, you should consider
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:28.620]   if there are opportunities even beyond a certain country into a certain region.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:33.260]   So some countries are big enough in and of themselves that they can provide benefits,
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:36.860]   but then some countries are also part of larger blocks.
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:40.940]   So the most well-known block would be something like the European Union.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:46.220]   Now, I'm not aware of any countries in the European Union who will provide birthright
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:51.100]   citizenship exclusively for a child who's born there, regardless of the citizenship
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.220]   of their parent.
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:57.180]   But what you should consider is if you have some claim on citizenship yourself, can you
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:00.220]   help your child to have that citizenship by being born in that country?
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:08.380]   One of the short sight things that I see people look at is they look just to the 30-ish countries
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:11.420]   where the child can be automatically a citizen because it's born there.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:15.980]   But you need to consider if you're having your child in a certain place can help them
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:20.860]   to receive a citizenship that you have, because there are actually a whole set of countries
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:29.020]   in addition to those 30-ish countries that you read on the internet that have some sort
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:33.340]   of more restricted right of birth.
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:43.580]   So for example, one example would be a country like South Africa.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:50.300]   If a child is born in South Africa, of course, a child born in South Africa to South African
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:51.580]   citizens would be a citizen.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.740]   But if a child is born in South Africa to permanent residents of South Africa, that
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:58.380]   child can be granted South African citizenship.
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:03.980]   Or the United Kingdom has a law that at least if one parent is either a British citizen
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:09.740]   or legally settled in the country at birth or upon the 10th birthday of the child, regardless
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:13.740]   of their citizenship status, that child can be a British citizen.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:18.700]   So could you do want to be legally settled in Great Britain under those terms?
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:22.380]   There are actually more options than just the 30 countries.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:26.860]   But in terms of in that one, depending on what happens with Brexit, that one would be
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:30.620]   the kind of thing that could potentially give you access to the EU.
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.300]   There are other regions though.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:37.420]   For example, in South America, there's a large region called Mercosur, which includes, let's
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:47.340]   see, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, and as primary members and associate members
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.980]   would include Chile and a couple of the South American countries.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:56.700]   The point is residents or citizens of any of those Mercosur countries have fairly unrestricted
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.740]   ability to move and to work in those other countries.
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:05.100]   It's not quite as seamless as the EU is, but it is fairly easy.
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.900]   So if you are the parent of an Argentine citizen, you can move to Brazil.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.820]   If you're a Brazilian citizen, you can move to Paraguay and you can live and work there
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.420]   with an expedited system.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:21.580]   In the Caribbean, there is an alliance called CARICOM, which can have certain benefits as
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.420]   well in the Caribbean islands.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:28.380]   So think about those benefits to the baby and try to think about what will give the
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.860]   best benefit for the baby.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:37.660]   One, I guess another interesting thing for you to consider would be often there are aspects
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:42.540]   of this that George has talked about in the blog post that you read about, such as other
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:48.780]   benefits with relationships that certain countries might have with a place that the child can
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.260]   be born.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:53.980]   And one example would be it doesn't have to be just necessarily outside of the country.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.940]   So let me give an example.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:23:07.500]   If I were a Mexican, if I were a Canadian, a Canadian couple wanting to have a baby,
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:14.060]   and if I wanted my baby to be an American by birth, on the basis of birthright citizenship,
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:18.540]   I wouldn't necessarily just automatically go to New York and have the baby in New York.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:22.060]   Now, that would be good because that would automatically confer dual citizenship upon
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:27.660]   the baby with, of course, the obligations to the US government, which can be, you know,
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:28.380]   it's probably helpful.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.980]   I mean, the US is such a massive financial powerhouse.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.540]   It's a valuable thing to have a US citizenship financially.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:39.980]   But I would consider going and having the baby in a place like Puerto Rico because now
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.780]   I can get multiple benefits for my baby.
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:49.660]   Children who are born in Puerto Rico are automatically citizens of Puerto Rico by birth
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:52.860]   and also citizens of the United States.
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:58.540]   So by the basis of being born in Puerto Rico, my child will automatically be an American
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.860]   citizen, can get an American passport, et cetera.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:07.100]   But as a native-born Puerto Rican, that child has additional benefits with Spain.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:13.180]   Because Puerto Rico was formerly a Spanish possession, then a Puerto Rican who was native-born
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:19.500]   in Puerto Rico has the opportunity to have the expedited path to citizenship that Spain
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.940]   offers, which is as little as two years of residence.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:26.780]   So now, if you're thinking about, let's pretend you're a Canadian, and you're saying,
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.900]   "Where can I have my baby so that it has multiple benefits?"
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:34.700]   Going and having the baby in Puerto Rico gives it automatically US citizenship by birth.
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:39.740]   Then you can move to Spain, spend two years in Spain, and now there's an expedited path
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:43.820]   to citizenship for that child to have now an EU passport.
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:45.260]   So what have you done with something like that?
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:50.620]   Well, now you've opened up the European Union and Canada and the United States to that child,
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:53.580]   where they can legally live anywhere in those three regions.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.740]   They can work anywhere in those three regions.
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.700]   They can travel.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:02.220]   And if they follow that path through, they can have major benefits.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:07.740]   There are a lot of these little countries, whether it's a place like Barbados or possibly
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:08.460]   Jamaica.
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:14.300]   But Barbados, being a former British possession, people who are born in Barbados automatically
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.780]   are citizens of Barbados by birth.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:19.100]   You say, "Well, what benefit is that?"
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:20.220]   Well, it's maybe not bad.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.340]   There are certain benefits to it, although it may not be a huge region.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.500]   It does provide access to the Caribbean under the CARICOM agreements, etc.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:33.260]   But then you have the opportunity to have possibly an expedited path to British citizenship
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.820]   and possibly a British passport.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:38.380]   So you can look into things like that for yourself.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:44.620]   There are opportunities there with the French government, with some of the European governments
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.420]   through being born in their island communities.
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.180]   Now, other benefits for the baby.
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:55.260]   I'm not sure that necessarily being born in the biggest place is always necessarily the
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.220]   best thing.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:00.220]   And this is where I think a little bit about the value of smaller countries.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:05.180]   Now, being Americans and assuming you're going to pass on American citizenship to your baby,
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:10.300]   you're already now doing business with a very large country.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:14.940]   But what opportunities would there be for your child if they were a citizen of a smaller
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.740]   country?
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:22.540]   One of the dangerous trends is that most of the large countries, the United States, the
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:31.100]   Canada, many of the big Brazils, the Mexicans, as they have financial resources, these countries
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:37.020]   are pursuing the path of engaging in much more global spying.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:44.140]   They're imposing more and more obligations onto their citizens.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:49.820]   So I think if you care about freedom, there's actually a really good argument in favor of
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:54.140]   your child being a citizen of a much smaller country.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:59.260]   I mean, imagine if your child were born in Nicaragua and were a native-born Nicaraguan
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:26:59.660]   citizen.
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:05.260]   On that, you can have a baby in Nicaragua, automatically citizen by birth.
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:08.620]   Now, Nicaragua is a pretty poor place.
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:13.420]   And even worse, in the last couple of years, it had a major turn towards heavy leftism
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:16.940]   and socialism, which is at this point kind of in the DNA of the Nicaraguans.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:22.620]   But there's no possibility that the Nicaraguan government, at least in our foreseeable lifetime,
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:26.380]   is ever going to have the money to be able to spy on the world.
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:30.460]   And so if you're a Nicaraguan citizen traveling on a Nicaraguan passport, you can be pretty
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:34.300]   free to float around the world and not have to deal with them kind of tracking you down.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:40.300]   So there's kind of a freedom argument in favor of for an individual that goes against
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.100]   big country.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:45.100]   Now, I think it's more compelling to give the child access to live and work in other
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:48.700]   places, but you can consider that for yourself.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:51.500]   Now, let's quickly talk about benefits for the siblings.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:56.380]   If you already have children, there may be certain benefits for the baby, but then also
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.140]   benefits for the siblings.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:03.900]   For example, the siblings might be able to qualify for a residency visa and/or to qualify
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:09.340]   for an expedited path to citizenship, especially when they are minor children.
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:12.460]   For example, I'll talk in a moment about a country like Brazil.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:20.380]   Brazil has an interesting law where if a child is born in Brazil, then they are automatically
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:26.300]   Brazilian by birth, and then the siblings, the minor siblings of a child born in Brazil
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:33.100]   can have an extremely expedited path to citizenship once after really, in many ways, as little
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.100]   as six months or eight months of residency.
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:45.500]   Then the siblings of a child born to a Brazilian baby by birth can have an expedited path to
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.220]   citizenship.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.580]   So there are some things for siblings.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:48.300]   Consider that.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.660]   But then let's talk about parents.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.420]   What about the benefits for parents?
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:57.500]   There may or may not be any benefits that you would like to have as the parent of a
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:02.220]   child, and they're much harder to come by than the benefits for the child.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.900]   So you might choose something that's in the best interest of the child, but actually won't
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:08.460]   benefit the parents in any way, or you might not.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:09.420]   So let me give an example.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:14.300]   It's my understanding of the Canadian immigration system that any child born in Canada is
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.060]   automatically a Canadian citizen.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:24.300]   But Canada doesn't have any possibility or any recognition for immigration for the parents
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.260]   simply based upon the fact that they're parents of a Canadian citizen.
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:34.620]   If you want to move to Canada, you have to qualify for a residency visa based upon the
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:37.820]   Canadian system of law, based upon their point system in their case.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:38.860]   Are you a valuable worker?
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.820]   Can you get enough points?
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:41.900]   And can your application be approved?
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:45.900]   So you don't get any benefits as the parent of a Canadian child.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:49.100]   Now, that's different than a country like Mexico.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:54.860]   So Mexico has the ability, if you have a baby in Mexico, the baby is automatically Mexican.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:30:00.300]   And then you can apply for a residency visa as the parent of a Mexican baby.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:05.900]   And under their doctrine of family reunification, that residency visa will be issued to you
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.140]   so that you can now live in Mexico.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.020]   A country like the United States is kind of interesting.
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.500]   It's not really one or the other.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:20.220]   There is no automatic rights to stay, no automatic residency for parents who go and have their
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.820]   baby in the United States.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:27.180]   But there is the possibility once the child is older and working to sponsor their relatives.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.860]   But it's a much harder process.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:35.740]   I find that particular debate so ironic in the political space, where in reality, people
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:39.580]   who often rail against birthright citizenship, there was a big scuffle in the United States
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:44.140]   a couple of years ago about ending birthright citizenship, et cetera, and somehow changing
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:44.300]   it.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:46.460]   You need to have a constitutional amendment to change it.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:51.020]   But in reality, based upon the way the US taxes its worldwide citizens, no matter where
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:54.220]   they live, people should be clamoring for everybody to come to the United States and
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.980]   then leave again and go somewhere else.
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:00.620]   Because a baby who's born in the United States is saddled with a lifetime tax obligation,
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:03.900]   even if they never again set foot in the United States.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.500]   So it's pretty amazing.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:10.860]   The major benefits for the parents would primarily be a right to get a residency visa.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:17.820]   And on this basis, it can be a big benefit.
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:28.220]   To your question, there is no country in the world that will automatically confer some
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:33.100]   form of citizenship on the parent because they're the parent of a child born in that
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:33.740]   country.
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.940]   So there's no country in the world that you can go there, have a baby, the child's
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.260]   automatically a citizen, and then a week later, you're a citizen.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.460]   Doesn't exist.
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:44.060]   The fastest in the world, when you start reading the articles around this, the fastest in the
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.700]   world that you'll read about again and again is Brazil.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:51.820]   And the idea is if you go to Brazil and have a baby in Brazil, Brazilian law allows you
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:59.580]   to apply for citizenship as the parent of a Brazilian child after one year of residency.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:04.460]   So the way it works is you go to Brazil, you have your baby in Brazil, you apply, the baby
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:08.220]   is a citizen by birth, you apply now for your residency visa.
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:13.580]   Once your residency visa is issued, then you wait one year and then you apply for citizenship.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:16.060]   So the idea is it could be as fast as one year.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:20.460]   Now, what the law says and what the practice is are night and day different things.
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:26.060]   So what it actually is in Brazil, it's not one year of residency to apply for the visa.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:30.220]   It needs to be more like two because you're dealing with the local officials and they
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.260]   want to see if they're going to take the application, they want to see that you're
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.900]   legit a resident of Brazil.
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:39.660]   And so that means that you can't just go there and show up every now and then.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.500]   You've got to go and you've got to build a life there.
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.500]   You've got to buy a house or rent a house.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:49.020]   You've got to get a job or start a business in Brazil using your Brazilian residency visa.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:56.460]   You have to go and you need to pay taxes to Brazil under their tax rates on your worldwide
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:56.780]   income.
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:02.220]   You need to become a legit Brazilian person who's integrated in the local society.
[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:05.020]   Then you go and you apply after usually about two years.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.300]   They want to see at least two years.
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:11.340]   And then the process itself is of issuing the paperwork on the ground right now is about
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.460]   two more years.
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:16.540]   And so in reality, if you're going to go and have a Brazilian baby, it's going to be
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:22.940]   for the path to citizenship for you is going to be closer to about four years at the very
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:23.420]   fastest.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:27.500]   Maybe I mean, sorry, I shouldn't say the very fastest, but the normal thing to expect
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.860]   would be about four years.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:32.140]   So if you're going to get that Brazilian passport, you need to be there for about four
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:32.300]   years.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.540]   And by the way, then you have, there's also the language test.
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:40.380]   You have to be able to pass a Portuguese fluency exam in order to become a Brazilian
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:41.260]   citizen.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.260]   So you need to think about it.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:48.300]   The biggest benefit for the parent is going to be the ability to either now or in the
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.420]   future apply for a residency visa.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:55.420]   So the reason I asked about the time, you don't necessarily have to do this all at once.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:59.420]   Let's use Brazil as an example, because that's the one you always, always read touted in
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.660]   this series of articles that you can find online.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:05.420]   If you think about Brazil, you could go to Brazil.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:10.220]   You could be there for a month is probably a little fast with Brazil, maybe a little
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:14.060]   longer, but a month, a month or two, you go there, you have the baby.
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.820]   The baby becomes a Brazilian citizen.
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:19.020]   You finish up the paperwork for the baby, get their citizenship, and then you can leave
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.020]   and you take the baby back to Asia.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:25.180]   Now, six years from now or 10 years from now, you can now go back to Brazil.
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:28.620]   Of course, you go on a tourist visa in that case, but you go back to Brazil.
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:32.860]   And then once you're in Brazil, you apply for your residency as the parent of a Brazilian
[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:38.140]   child, unless something happens with the law in terms of a constitutional change, which
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.580]   is pretty unusual.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:43.340]   Unless something happens with the law, you could exercise that right of residency 10
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:44.300]   years from now.
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:50.380]   And so this is the same thing that happens with Canadians and with or people who, you
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:52.940]   know, say you're Chinese, you come to the United States, have your baby in the United
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:55.900]   States, the baby is a US citizen, you go back to China, you live there.
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:59.100]   But then when your baby is an adult, then they can move to the United States and then
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.220]   potentially sponsor the parents to come to the United States as well.
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:06.700]   So your biggest benefit to think about is going to be a residency visa.
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:11.900]   So I ask you the question, is there a place that you'd like to have residency where you
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.940]   can get benefits for the baby and benefits for you?
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:19.580]   Now, as we move into this a little deeper, then you would want to consider, is it a place
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:24.380]   that's fairly easy for me to get residency, even if I'm not the parent of a Brazilian
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:24.780]   child?
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:25.420]   Give me an example.
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:29.660]   Let's say you want to Panama, right?
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.180]   Panama would be a really great place to live, to work.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:38.220]   Panama has, it's a bustling economy, booming economy in Central America.
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:43.820]   It's a financial hub for, in many ways, the world, but definitely of the Americas.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:45.020]   It's a financial hub.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.300]   It's in a wonderful, it's in the same time zone as the Eastern time zone.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:51.260]   And so it's very connected and very easy to live there and work and do business in the
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.380]   East Coast of the United States.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:55.180]   What else about Panama?
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:58.380]   It is easy to get to.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.020]   They have a wonderful tax system, a territorial tax system.
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:03.500]   So you can live there and have a very efficient tax life.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:08.380]   But the thing is, do you need to go and have a baby there that's a natural born Panamanian?
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.780]   It's not hard right now.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:15.500]   If you're from one of the friendly nations, it's not hard to apply for a Panamanian friendly
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:19.580]   nations visa and for you to go and live in Panama under the friendly friendly nations
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:24.060]   visa to cost you some few thousands of dollars of lawyer fees, make a deposit in a bank.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.380]   But it's not that hard for you to get that visa.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:32.220]   So if you're going to go to the hard work of going to Panama and doing that, do you
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:35.500]   really want to have the baby there or do you want to just get the friendly nations visa,
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.660]   which you can do with a few thousand dollars of legal fees?
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:42.700]   Similarly, many countries have various visa options that you can get.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:46.780]   It's not that difficult for an American to go and get residence in Mexico.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:48.140]   You can get residence in Brazil.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:51.900]   You become an investor and apply under their investor program, or you can go to Colombia,
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:55.580]   or you can apply for pension auto visas throughout Central and South America.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:57.500]   So there are a lot of these.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.580]   So you're going to think, is this really where I want to have it?
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.220]   It's not easy.
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:03.260]   Then we go to other considerations.
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:11.980]   So you want to consider what obligations would I be signing my child up for by having them
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:13.420]   in this country?
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:16.460]   And so let's use the United States as an example.
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:21.740]   It's a major obligation to have a child in the United States because you're signing your
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:28.300]   child up with the burden and the possibility of US citizenship by having your child in
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:29.500]   the United States.
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:33.180]   But that's a burden that will flow with them throughout their entire lifetime.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:38.300]   Now, in many cases, I think the economic argument would say it's still worth considering,
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.460]   but that's the kind of thing that you have to consider.
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:44.940]   One obligation for you to be very careful of would be something like military registration.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:49.180]   Some countries mandate military service for their citizens.
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:53.500]   So let's see, having Israeli citizenship.
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:58.620]   In Israel, all young men and all young women are obligated to serve in the Israeli Defense
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.420]   Force.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:01.740]   So your child will have to serve.
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:06.220]   Now, some places may have a military obligation, but it's a little bit less likely.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:07.660]   So for example, Brazil.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:11.900]   If you have a baby in Brazil, that baby will be obligated to Brazilian military service
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:16.620]   in the Brazilian Army once they're a, I think it's just for men is my understanding there,
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:17.660]   but at 18 years old.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.500]   So they require to report that.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:24.380]   And even if they're a Brazilian living abroad, they still have to go and request exemptions
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:25.340]   to that.
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:30.140]   Now, it's not that I don't think it's that big of a risk in that in their case, who is
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:31.980]   Brazil necessarily going to go and fight?
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:36.380]   They're not that inclined to military conflict.
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:38.060]   There's fairly easy to get out of.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:43.340]   So I don't think it's a huge risk, but you want to consider something like military registration.
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:48.940]   You also want to consider other obligations of the that you're potentially exposing your
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:49.820]   child to.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:53.420]   For example, some places you would have to pay into the national health system.
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:59.340]   And so are you obligating your child to some system of taxation, especially if that obligation
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:07.980]   would be on an ongoing basis, and especially if it's not funding things that you think
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:09.180]   should be funded.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:13.660]   Some countries impose an obligation to vote where you're legally required to vote in
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.620]   that country's elections.
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.940]   Do you want to impose that obligation on them?
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:25.900]   Residency in some places can bring other challenges that especially Americans are not used to
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:26.860]   thinking about.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:32.780]   Things that are important to me, for example, would be things like the ability to homeschool,
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.860]   homeschooling versus government schooling.
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:39.260]   In the United States, homeschooling fought all the big battles back in the 1970s.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:42.780]   And so now it's fairly easy for you to homeschool.
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:44.700]   And in most states, it's pretty easy to do.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:46.940]   It's not the same in the rest of the world.
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:50.860]   You may find yourself, if you're trying to live and work in another country, you find
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:55.980]   yourself and your child, especially as a citizen of that child, with significant challenges
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:01.020]   dealing with the government if you want to do something like homeschool.
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:07.820]   And then I would say one of the big challenges is even the process itself of giving birth.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:12.300]   The entire process of birth in and of itself can be very, very challenging.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.700]   It's a very vulnerable time in a woman's life.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:20.460]   It's a very challenging time in a couple's life as you learn new things, especially if
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:21.500]   this is your first baby.
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:24.060]   I remember when my wife and I had our first baby.
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:29.100]   And just the challenge of birth itself was difficult to think about.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.940]   What kind of birth do we want to have?
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:33.260]   Where do we want to give birth?
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:38.380]   And there are all these big questions that have to be solved with the whole birth process.
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.220]   Are we going to give birth in a hospital?
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.460]   Are we going to give birth out of a hospital?
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.060]   What kind of care are we going to have?
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.900]   Who are the people that we're going to have involved?
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:49.820]   What classes, what birthing methodology are we going to follow?
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:51.100]   What convictions are we going to have?
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.860]   Are we going to have a higher or a doula?
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:53.900]   Are we going to vaccinate?
[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:54.940]   Are we going to circumcise?
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:41:00.220]   Are we going to like all these big questions that new parents that face.
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:05.180]   And it's really challenging to give birth even in a culture that you're totally comfortable
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:05.680]   with.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.580]   And this in and of itself can be challenging.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.940]   Now to take it out of a culture that you're comfortable with and move it into another
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:17.580]   place where now you're navigating the birthing system in an unfamiliar place and you're
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.420]   navigating unfamiliar laws.
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:23.260]   For example, my wife and I have never had a baby in a hospital.
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:27.420]   Now thankfully we've had smooth low-risk pregnancies, but we've never had a baby in
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:27.920]   a hospital.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.620]   I've received all my babies when they were born.
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:36.700]   But that's easy and legal in the United States, but it's not necessarily easy nor is it
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.420]   necessarily legal in other countries.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:42.300]   And so navigating the birthing system can be a challenge.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:46.860]   Things like understanding what your rights are in that process.
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:53.660]   I'm fairly comfortable throwing my weight around if I'm in an American hospital because
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:57.740]   I understand what my rights are, I understand what my wife's rights are, I understand
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:58.460]   who's in charge.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:04.380]   I'm a little less comfortable in other places where the laws are not on the side of the
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:08.140]   individual, but the laws are much more in line with what the government says should
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:08.640]   be done.
[01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:14.540]   And then navigating these things in a language you don't speak can be challenging.
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:19.500]   So now you've got to bring in an interpreter and figure out how to get your wishes done
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.100]   in an interpreter.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:27.100]   And then in some cases you just simply don't have the legal rights that you do in other
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:27.900]   places.
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:33.180]   For example, in the United States, one of the challenges that parents have to face is
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.980]   if they're going to vaccinate their children or not.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.620]   And it's not as simple as just saying, "Yeah, I'm in favor of vaccination."
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:40.460]   You have to decide, "Am I going to vaccinate my baby?
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.420]   Am I going to do it right away?
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.540]   Am I going to do it at some point?
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.700]   Am I going to do the standard CDC schedule?
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:47.740]   Am I going to not vaccinate at all?
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:49.580]   Am I going to vaccinate according to a modified schedule?"
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.780]   Really, really tough.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:55.340]   And it's one of the most contentious, difficult issues that you see it on the news every day,
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:57.020]   measles outbreak and all this stuff.
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:00.940]   But in the United States, if you don't wish to vaccinate, you can do it entirely fine.
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:05.180]   And the only time you face is a handful of states if the child goes to a government school
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:05.980]   or a private school.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.740]   But it's not the same in many other places in the world.
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:10.860]   So if you're going to...
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:13.260]   Well, let's leave it at that.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.220]   It's not the same.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:15.340]   It's not legal.
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:18.860]   You don't have the legal right to opt out.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:22.300]   Now, whether you have the practical right or not, that depends on who's going to help
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:22.860]   you with the birth.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:24.380]   What are you going to do?
[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:25.660]   And so it's a tough...
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.140]   There are a whole bunch of things that are often not thought of.
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:32.620]   And then the documents, the process of getting the documents can be really, really challenging.
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.100]   So what documents do you bring from home?
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:36.780]   What documents does the baby need?
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:39.660]   How do you, in many ways, get the baby out of the country?
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:45.740]   You go to a place and have the baby, the baby is going to be trapped in that country until
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:49.980]   the baby gets a passport issued and the permission of the government to leave.
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.020]   Some countries, they don't care.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:52.300]   They don't track anything.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:57.020]   Other countries, you've got to have all kinds of permission slips and etc. filled off.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.740]   So this is the stuff that the articles don't tell you.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.860]   This is the stuff that we learned by doing it.
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:07.820]   So that's why I like to write a course, because at this point, I can now write a course on
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:15.100]   all the stuff that I wish the articles had said, but that they didn't.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.980]   And it's not as easy as you think it will be.
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:22.380]   So I would give you kind of a couple of summary things for you to consider.
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:27.420]   This is not at all an exhaustive list, but just some things for you to think of.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:33.420]   First, expand your thinking beyond just the 30 country list that you read online.
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:37.740]   Think about your ancestry and your heritage and consider if there's anything unique to
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:38.540]   your situation.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:41.580]   Do you have, do you already have another citizenship?
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.820]   Because you might actually want to give birth in a country where one of you has a connection
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:50.780]   or a tie because of the benefits there, even if it's not one of those 30 countries that
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:54.940]   automatically confers unrestricted birthright citizenship on the child.
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.780]   Consider that.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:03.260]   Consider how much time you actually have available and consider, I would be remiss, I didn't
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:07.340]   mean to make this, but you have to also then consider the medical, the quality of the medical
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:07.740]   system.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:11.980]   Sounds silly, but I guess I shouldn't have kind of breezed over that.
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:15.580]   I'm sure Tuvalu is a lovely place.
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:16.300]   I haven't been there.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:18.940]   I've seen pictures and videos of it, but it looks like a beautiful place.
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:25.100]   But you cannot say that the, that Tuvalu is going to have the same medical resources that
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:26.380]   are available in Mexico City.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:33.340]   Mexico City, and any city in Mexico, is going to have top tier, class A, excellent medical
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:33.900]   care.
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:37.980]   And that's super important because you're dealing with the lives of your wife and the
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:39.100]   lives of your baby.
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:44.380]   And so you, especially as a father, you don't want to be careless or cavalier about that
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.340]   in any way.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:47.020]   It's too important to be careless or cavalier.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:50.220]   So you need to think about medical care as well, which is going to probably point you
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.780]   to a handful of countries.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:46:01.260]   You know, Chad offers, the country of Chad in Africa offers Chadian citizenship to a
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.900]   child who's born in Chad, according to the Wikipedia article.
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:09.260]   I'm not confident in the medical situation in Chad.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:11.660]   Canada, on the other hand, I have no questions.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:12.860]   Mexico, got no questions.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:14.060]   The United States, no questions.
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.420]   Brazil, no questions.
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.060]   Easy.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.980]   You know, Chile, no questions.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:21.980]   There's top tier medical care available.
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.980]   So consider that.
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:29.980]   And consider if you and your wife want a certain benefit for yourselves and/or if it's just
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:31.100]   for the child.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:35.100]   It's not wrong for you to want benefits yourself.
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:38.700]   The ability to apply for a residency visa is an extremely valuable thing.
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:44.540]   And if I were, in one case, it's so different for you being a US American and your wife
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:48.460]   being US American than it is for, say, somebody from Pakistan.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:53.420]   I mean, if I were from Pakistan, there's no question that I would be working like crazy
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:59.180]   to make sure that we had a baby in some other place that conferred birthright citizenship.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:03.980]   And I'd be doing that for the baby and then also for us as a parent, because it's pretty
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:10.380]   hard for me to really make it really excellent for my family in Pakistan.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:16.940]   And earlier, I kind of skipped over even the travel benefits of the passport of that country.
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:20.700]   One of the big things that Americans are not used to thinking about and most Westerners
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:24.620]   not used to thinking about is the quality of a passport from a certain country.
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:29.980]   But a Pakistani passport makes it almost impossible for a person to move without constant
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:32.220]   visa applications all around the world.
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:38.060]   Or if you're from Afghanistan or from Iraq or from Iran or one of these countries, citizens
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:41.660]   of those countries, especially citizens who want to travel, who want to live and work
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:45.500]   abroad, do business, are often desperate to have a second passport.
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:53.820]   So there's a very compelling case for them to go and have their baby abroad and get the
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:58.860]   benefit of a residency visa in a new place where they can, over time, naturalize as citizens
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:47:59.420]   in time.
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:04.620]   So think about, is it just for the baby or are you also going to consider benefits for
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.540]   you and your wife?
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:09.260]   It's not a right or a wrong, necessarily.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:12.540]   I think that you'll have to think about the overall benefits.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:17.420]   So a few highlights, and I'm going to run, just run down the list of countries in alphabetical
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:21.260]   order from the Wikipedia article, and then I will wrap up here.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:25.100]   So here are the countries that, according to Wikipedia, are available for unrestricted
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:26.380]   birthright citizenship.
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.220]   Antigua and Barbuda.
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:32.060]   Possibilities, small Caribbean countries.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:34.300]   I'm going to lump all the Caribbean countries together.
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:37.180]   Antigua, Barbuda, Barbados, etc.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:41.340]   With the exceptions of the ones that possibly provide citizenship by investment programs,
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:44.700]   you should consider those because if you actually want to live there and naturalize, you may
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:51.740]   be able to get basically a pretty decent travel document that gives you benefits without necessarily
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:54.780]   having to pay the however many hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:58.140]   So Antigua and Barbuda, don't have any comments.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:59.340]   Argentina.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.180]   Argentina is an interesting choice for you for a number of reasons.
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:10.140]   First, Argentina has one of the fastest paths to citizenship of really two years of residency.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:14.220]   Now, I don't know what the actual time on the ground is with dealing with the bureaucracy,
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:18.460]   but the law is two years of residency and you're eligible to apply for Argentinian citizenship.
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:25.660]   And Argentinian citizenship is actually a pretty decent citizenship to have, in addition
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:29.820]   to the fact that Argentina itself is a huge country.
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:34.700]   And so back to that place to legally live, huge country and part of Mercosur.
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:40.300]   Problem with Argentina is figuring out how to deal with the current economic system can
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.820]   make certain things very cheap.
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:45.420]   I mean, if you go down to southern Argentina, I think you'd probably find a safe place
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:46.060]   to live.
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:48.300]   And yet it's incredibly low priced.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:54.940]   And so it'd be a great place to go for to live worldwide taxation for residents.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:59.900]   So Barbados consider the is guaranteed.
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:02.140]   Consider the path into the UK if that's important to you.
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.220]   According to Wikipedia, there's some arguments that they're proposing ending birthright
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.180]   citizenship.
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:07.740]   Belize.
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:11.820]   I don't know what to say about Belize.
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:16.940]   It's kind of a wacky Central American country, largely English English speaking, primarily
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:20.620]   black Afro Caribbean place.
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:25.340]   Interesting place, interesting, but not exactly the nicest of places that you might want to
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:25.580]   live.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:29.340]   Not hard to get residency yourself in Belize.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:29.900]   It's not.
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:31.660]   I don't think it's what I would pick.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:33.020]   Bolivia comes next.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:34.940]   Interesting socialist country, South America.
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:41.020]   I don't serve any significant benefits to choose Bolivia over some of the other options.
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:44.940]   Brazil is a really interesting choice.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:50.140]   First class medical care, really diverse country, which is a real benefit.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.940]   If you're black, if you're white, if you're brown, if you're red, if you're yellow, doesn't
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:53.580]   matter.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.820]   There are some people of your color in Brazil.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:57.660]   Huge economy.
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:01.820]   200 something million people there in South America, part of Mercosur.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:05.980]   Not really any negative baggage associated with the passport.
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.500]   I mean, who hates the Brazilians?
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.420]   I don't know of anybody that hates the Brazilians.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.860]   So there are a lot of good solutions in Brazil.
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:17.340]   Brazil will be touted as being one of the fastest paths to citizenship for the parents.
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:19.020]   I warn you, it's not true.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:19.900]   I researched it.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.020]   I know what I'm talking about.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:22.300]   It's not true.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:26.300]   It's four years of residency, basically plan on a four year pathway.
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:31.900]   Heavy taxation for residents and taxation on your worldwide income.
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:37.500]   Very kind of socialist police state, which can be hard to take if you're more freedom
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:38.140]   oriented.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:43.500]   They're famous for having just elected President Bolsonaro, who's supposedly right wing, but
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:48.700]   you're kind of got this long history of socialist police state, which is a little bit hard to
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.420]   deal with.
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:53.100]   But Brazil, I think, should be very high on your list for consideration.
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:58.060]   Just don't expect what you read about online to be true about the one year path to citizenship.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:58.860]   Canada.
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:05.820]   Canada, I think, is a really excellent option, but it may be superfluous for an American,
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:10.140]   for a US American, especially if you don't think you or your children would ever renounce
[01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:10.700]   citizenship.
[01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:15.740]   For people who might renounce citizenship, I think Canada is a really great option because
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:24.700]   you have a powerful, powerful passport, good economy, kind of first world, very easy English
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:26.380]   speaking in the majority of it.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:30.380]   And one of the most important things, you have very easy access to the United States.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:33.500]   Canadians have a special relationship with the United States, more special than any other
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:34.540]   country in the world.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:37.580]   Six months, fairly automatic entry into the United States.
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:41.260]   They don't even have to complete ESTA to pass US immigration.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:42.620]   So I think Canada is a...
[01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:46.860]   Canada, that's what I always call it with a Canadian buddy of mine.
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:52.060]   Canada, I think, is a really strong option, but in many ways it kind of ebbs and flows
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:53.660]   with the United States.
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:54.620]   So you don't...
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:58.140]   I think there's more benefit if you're thinking about your child, think about South America,
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:01.740]   think about some economies that might grow rather than Canada.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:04.460]   Chad is an option.
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:07.900]   I have never been to Chad, but you could consider it.
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:11.740]   Chile is, I think, a very powerful option for you to consider.
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:12.940]   Chile, the biggest...
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:18.620]   One of the biggest and most modern economies in South America, very much on the right path.
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:25.020]   Really compelling place to consider living, working, etc.
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:28.300]   Very much growing, unique in many, many ways.
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:28.940]   Beautiful.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:34.380]   The cities are not inexpensive, but they're just really neat option would be Chile.
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:38.940]   Downside of two reasons not to consider arguments against Chile would be number one, worldwide
[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:44.620]   taxation on residents if you trigger the residency and you'll have to if you wind up moving there.
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:52.380]   But Chile and passport, very good passport for your child and really, really compelling
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:52.700]   option.
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:58.380]   Another argument against Chile, however, would be that Chile right now, at least, is a fairly
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:05.260]   easy place for you to get a visa to live even without having a baby there.
[01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:09.660]   So it might make sense if you're interested in a residency visa for yourself, it might
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:15.900]   make more sense for you to consider a place where it's harder to get a residency visa.
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:18.300]   But you're living in Asia, so you're probably not going to go there anyway.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.980]   Costa Rica is next.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.300]   Costa Rica is a really interesting option.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:26.460]   One of the major benefits of Costa Rica would be it's...
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:33.580]   No military, so you don't have to worry about your child getting drafted in some dumb war
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:34.620]   or something like that.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:40.700]   Costa Rica has a very peaceful reputation, one of the strongest, kind of safest places
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.500]   in Central America.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.340]   It's very convenient to the United States.
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:46.780]   Costa Rica is a very beautiful place.
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:50.300]   It makes most of its living on tourism, especially ecotourism.
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:55.900]   Economy is not that strong, not nearly as strong as a place like Panama, but it's not
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:56.220]   bad.
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:55:01.260]   And one of the great things, Costa Rica would be good if you're looking for that kind of
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:07.180]   small country option for your child where, "Hey, I want to be a citizen of a smaller
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:07.900]   country."
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:11.260]   Very easy to get to, first-class medical care in San Jose.
[01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:17.100]   Costa Rica is the benefit of a territorial tax system, can save you money if you wind
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:20.140]   up living there and give you a residency visa.
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:21.820]   So I think Costa Rica is an interesting option.
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:29.020]   It's not going to give your child access to a big market or to a big job market or a big
[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:31.100]   place to live.
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:32.380]   It's a small country.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:36.220]   Dominica, island down in the Caribbean, interesting.
[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:40.860]   Dominica is interesting because it also provides an economic citizenship, citizenship by
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:45.260]   investment program, but I'm not too familiar on the details of that.
[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:47.340]   Ecuador, don't have anything to say.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:52.860]   El Salvador, don't have much to say other than murder capital of Central America right
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:53.260]   now.
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:55.660]   Doesn't mean everywhere is dangerous, but be careful.
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:58.860]   Now you're in Asia, so the next option I think is interesting, Fiji.
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:06.060]   Fiji confers citizenship on children who are born there, and I think it's worth considering
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:10.140]   because it might be easier for you to get to Fiji than it would be for you to get to
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:11.340]   El Salvador.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:16.860]   The way that most of these countries work is if you apply for a residency visa after
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:21.580]   you have a child in that country is in order for you to maintain that residency visa, you
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:23.500]   need to show up semi-regularly.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:27.740]   Some countries every year, with some countries every few years, depends on the country.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:31.260]   Some countries every year, every few years, and then doesn't really matter.
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:35.660]   But a place like Fiji might have certain values and benefits, and especially if you are in
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:38.300]   Asia, it could be worth considering.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:41.980]   I don't know much about the Fijian passport, but could be worth considering.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.220]   Granada, don't have much to say.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.620]   Guatemala, interesting place in Central America.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:51.900]   I always think of Guatemala, it doesn't participate in CRS, which doesn't really matter for
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:55.740]   Americans, but for Europeans, it's kind of an interesting thing about Guatemala.
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:01.820]   But beautiful, mountainous country, really lovely, don't know much about the passport.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:07.580]   Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Lesotho, don't have much to say.
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:09.340]   Big one next would be Mexico.
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:15.660]   I think Mexico is a really interesting and compelling option for you to consider.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:19.420]   It's easy to get to, well not in your case from Asia, but for other American listeners,
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:20.380]   it's easy to get to.
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:25.180]   You can basically automatically get the six-month visa when you pass in.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:32.300]   First-rate medical care, easy to get to in a car, really wonderful place, massive, great
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:37.420]   economy in many ways, depending on, of course, where you are and what you're doing.
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:41.820]   One of the most interesting things about Mexico, I think, is the university system.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:47.580]   Mexico has government-run university systems, including even things like government-run
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:50.220]   medical schools.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:58.220]   I spoke one time to an optometrist who did all of her advanced education, went through
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:03.900]   medical school, went through advanced specialty, etc., in the Mexican government schools for
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:09.980]   medicine and only ever paid $50 per semester for her own fees.
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:11.100]   It was all government-paid.
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:14.780]   Interesting things like that for the access to medical school.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:19.740]   One of the challenges of financial planner I've always wrestled with is how do you help
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:24.300]   a somebody avoid the potential for $200,000 of student loan debt?
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:30.060]   One of the interesting solutions is go to a place, go through medical school where it's
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:31.980]   cheaper, and then test your way in.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:36.860]   Most countries, if they have a doctor who comes from another country that doesn't have
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:40.300]   the accredited school system of that country or residents don't have a medical test that
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:41.100]   they can have.
[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:45.020]   I'd assume, rather, if I were doing that, I'd rather go to Mexico, go through the Mexican
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:49.500]   government school system, build the knowledge, then test my way into somewhere else versus
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:53.260]   having the risk of $200,000 of medical school debt, things like that.
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:55.180]   But Mexico is an interesting option.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:57.260]   You could do that, of course, if you're an American in and of itself.
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:00.860]   Nicaragua, I don't really have anything good to say about Nicaragua.
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:02.700]   Your mileage may vary.
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:06.940]   Pakistan, I don't see any benefit of having a baby in Pakistan.
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:11.900]   Panama, I see benefit of having a baby there, but I would say, why bother when there are
[01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:13.340]   better places?
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:15.420]   Paraguay, I think, is really interesting.
[01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:20.780]   Paraguay is a place that you can have a baby and the baby is automatically Paraguayan.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:27.260]   Paraguay is part of Mercosur, so that gives you relatively easy access to other countries
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:31.740]   in the Mercosur agreement, including Brazil, Argentina, etc.
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:38.140]   And Paraguay has kind of a reputation for having fairly lax residency requirements for
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:41.260]   people who get a Paraguayan residency visa.
[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:46.060]   And so having a baby in Paraguay could be interesting, and then getting a Paraguayan
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.940]   residency visa could also be interesting.
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:53.260]   The trick here is I don't know of a benefit of having the baby in Paraguay that couldn't
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:58.460]   be had by simply taking the one month old there and applying for the Paraguayan residency
[01:59:58.460 --> 01:59:58.780]   visa.
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:04.540]   So why not have the baby in Brazil or Argentina or Uruguay and then go to Paraguay and get
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:06.220]   your residency stuff in order?
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:08.300]   Peru is, I think, really interesting.
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:14.780]   In my opinion, the most interesting thing about Peru is the visa-free access to Russia.
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:19.820]   Russia is an interesting and difficult place to get into, but if you're interested in doing
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:22.860]   business in Russia, you can, of course, apply for visas.
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:29.500]   But Peru has some more unique relationships that you don't get with other places.
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.500]   So consider Peru.
[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:38.460]   I don't love it, but it's worth your consideration if Russia is something interesting to you.
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:43.580]   St. Kitts and Nevis, another Caribbean program, research that.
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:45.260]   You can get citizenship by investment.
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:48.700]   St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tanzania.
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:51.820]   Tanzania is worth considering.
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:52.620]   I don't know much about it.
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:55.660]   Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, already discussed.
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:57.820]   The United States, already discussed.
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:58.700]   Uruguay.
[02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:07.340]   Uruguay is a really fascinating little country there in South America with a very European
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:10.540]   kind of cosmopolitan flair, which is different than other places.
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:14.060]   Uruguay is not a hard place to get visas to, though, in and of yourself.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.580]   So I'm not sure it'd be number one.
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:18.780]   And Venezuela, don't go to Venezuela right now.
[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:20.220]   It's not worth the risk.
[02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:25.260]   Do consider the list of restricted, just solely countries to see if any of those pique your
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:25.500]   interest.
[02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:28.220]   But I'll give you just a few ones for you to consider.
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:36.540]   I think number one would be Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Chile,
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:40.300]   and Argentina.
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:45.980]   Those, I think, would be five that, if I were in your shoes, would be at the top of my list.
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:51.180]   Different benefits of each one, but I think those five would be at the top of my list.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:56.380]   Given what you've said about your situation, I think that since you're already living in
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:02.380]   Asia, most likely just choose a place where you'll go, you'll have the baby, and then
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:04.220]   you'll plan to leave again.
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:09.420]   And you probably won't bother with applying for residency yourself, unless I'm wrong.
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:14.140]   Consider, do some research on those options that are available closer to you, especially
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:15.340]   in places like Fiji.
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:20.620]   And I would just say, do some research and see if you can find anything that, if you
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:25.580]   did get something like residency in a different place, having a baby there that would help
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:25.900]   you.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:30.860]   I don't know about that with the Asian countries, but just do some thinking to see if there's
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:35.180]   a way of having the baby there as a resident.
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:41.580]   I was just reviewing the list here of restricted countries, just solely countries, thinking
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:43.660]   about if I were living in Asia.
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:44.860]   A couple things stand out to me.
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:50.860]   Malaysia, according to Wikipedia, Malaysia indicates a person born in Malaysia with at
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:56.460]   least one parent being a Malaysian citizen or permanent resident is automatically a Malaysian
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:56.940]   citizen.
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.220]   So that could be interesting.
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:04.380]   It might be possible for you to get your Malaysian permanent residency in some number of months.
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:04.780]   I don't know.
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:06.300]   You would have to dig into that.
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:10.700]   And possibly having the baby in Malaysia could result in the baby being a Malaysian citizen.
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:14.780]   Another option might be New Zealand.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:16.780]   A little, New Zealand's not close to anything.
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:23.980]   A person born in New Zealand acquires New Zealand citizenship by birth only if one parent
[02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:26.620]   was a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident.
[02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:30.380]   So, and that includes Australian citizens and permanent residents.
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:36.620]   So maybe there might be an opportunity that you could get New Zealand or Australian residency
[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:40.220]   quick enough to do something in New Zealand.
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:45.820]   Other than that, I'm just not sure any specific solution.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:51.500]   Cambodia, in 1996, Cambodia changed the law to grant citizenship to children born to foreign
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:53.500]   parents living legally in the Kingdom of Cambodia.
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:57.500]   Might be a solution depending on where you are in Asia.
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:00.140]   Bahrain, I think is interesting.
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:04.780]   The Gulf States, a lot of possibilities.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:08.780]   Children born to a foreign father with valid residency permits who himself was born in
[02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:10.060]   Bahrain have right to citizenship.
[02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:15.100]   So that won't work with you unless you happen to have been born in Bahrain.
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:17.500]   So perhaps a strategy is in order.
[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:22.220]   If this is your first baby and you don't have a residency, go to one of those countries
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:26.300]   and then make sure that you're a permanent resident of Australia or New Zealand or something
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:27.820]   like that before your next baby.
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:28.460]   All right, that's it.
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.580]   I obviously didn't do it in 20 minutes.
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:33.980]   It took me more like 45, but I hope it was useful to you.
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:35.820]   I love this topic.
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:38.620]   I have, again, wanted to do a whole course on it.
[02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:41.260]   We've just scratched the tip of the iceberg of some of what my notes are.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:44.300]   I've kept a few things private and of course I've not shared with you what I've done.
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:44.940]   I'll just say this.
[02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:45.580]   I've done it.
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:46.540]   It's very doable.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:52.060]   You know, our newest, my son has a passport from the country that we're living in now.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:56.940]   So, you know, right here on my desk, it's possible.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:57.820]   He's got two passports.
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:04:58.620]   I could go.
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:00.860]   The process with the United States is fairly simple.
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:01.660]   You'll go and register.
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:04.940]   If you're going to give him US citizenship, which is an interesting question whether you
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:09.100]   should or not, you're going to give him US citizenship.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:13.100]   You go and file a consular report of birth abroad, follow the systems with your local
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:13.660]   embassy.
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:16.060]   You can get an American passport and an American.
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:21.660]   So your child will have a birth certificate from the country of their birth and also a
[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:26.140]   consular report of birth abroad designating that child and American citizen.
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:27.180]   One interesting thing.
[02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:29.660]   Let me, I said, I love this stuff.
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:32.140]   So here's one more interesting thing to consider.
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:40.940]   I think there is a real benefit for internationally minded Americans to have their baby outside
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:42.140]   of the United States.
[02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:47.420]   One of the benefits, which is minor, I admit it's minor, but it's not insignificant.
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:52.540]   One of the benefits is that the United States is not listed as a place of birth on their
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:57.260]   passports with almost any passport from almost any place in the world, at least that I'm
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:01.740]   aware of your place of birth is going to be listed on that passport.
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:06.300]   So even if you're, you're Australian, but the Australian is born in the United States,
[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:07.820]   it's going to say USA.
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:14.220]   And what happens is that can make your financial life very difficult due to the coercion that
[02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:18.940]   the United States foists upon the rest of the world financially with especially the
[02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:20.780]   FATCA legislation in the last decade.
[02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:27.180]   If your child goes to a bank and presents a passport, even if the passport is Australian
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:30.220]   and Australian's back because they're big government too, but let's say your child is
[02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:33.180]   Cambodian and you go to Hong Kong and you want to open a bank account.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:39.420]   If your child has a Cambodian passport, but it says place of birth, Florida, USA, they're
[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:43.260]   automatically going to be understood to be a US citizen subject to FATCA.
[02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:48.940]   Because, and that's considered to be an indicia, an indication of US citizenship.
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:52.700]   And so in order to, if the bank doesn't do business with US Americans in a situation
[02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:58.540]   like that, your child will have to produce a document industry indicating that they've
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:02.860]   renounced US citizenship to be able to bank with that, with that place.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:08.300]   So there's an actually an interesting debate among expats about whether they should even
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:13.180]   register their children as US citizens at the time of their birth or not.
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:19.340]   If you go and you have your baby in Chile, right?
[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:26.220]   You go to Chile, you have your baby in Chile, your baby have a Chilean birth certificate
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:29.100]   and you get your baby, a Chilean passport right away.
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:33.100]   And then you can travel the world with that baby as a Chilean, and you never actually
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:37.260]   have to register that baby as a US citizen.
[02:07:37.260 --> 02:07:42.300]   And then your child could decide later if they wanted to register as a US citizen or
[02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:43.020]   not.
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:46.780]   So you can keep the option open to your child to be a US citizen.
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:50.540]   So they go to school in the United States or, or easily travel to the United States
[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:54.540]   without a visa or work in the United States, take advantage of the economy, things like
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:55.100]   that.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:58.540]   But you don't have to subject them to the burden of US citizenship right away.
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:00.540]   They could wait for many, many years.
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:05.020]   Now, most Americans would just kind of automatically register their child, but you should
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:07.820]   know that there's actually a really interesting argument against that.
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:11.740]   And I've thought a lot about that, that there's a decent argument to be said for not even
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:12.940]   registering your child.
[02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:15.900]   It's an option if they want to move to the United States in the future, you have to keep
[02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:19.820]   all the documentation to prove citizenship because your, your, your, your child will
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:24.300]   automatically inherit American citizenship based upon having two American parents.
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:28.060]   And there are some laws about one American parent and the amount of time in the United
[02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:28.940]   States, but it's fairly simple.
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:30.860]   You can look it up on the consulate website.
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:32.140]   So consider that.
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:34.060]   But I think that's all I have to say on that subject.
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:35.820]   Hope you enjoyed the Q&A show.
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:37.980]   That is the kind of Q&A show that I like doing.
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:41.500]   It's the kind of diversity of questions that I find to be really fun.
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.900]   And so I hope that you have enjoyed it as well.
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:49.900]   I'm always careful with making forward-looking statements on the show, but ideally I should
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:56.140]   be able to be able to do these Q&A shows fairly regularly going forward.
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:09:02.140]   So I would encourage you come on by patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, sign up as a patron so that you can join me
