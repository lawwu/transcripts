[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.280]   I'm Becky Cortman from Nomad Together podcast for location-independent families and those
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.160]   who aspire to be one. Get ready for it. Today's podcast is the first of a two-part series on
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.040]   money. That thing we love, hate, need, want, and spend way too much time thinking about. Essentially
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.320]   it's what gives us freedom or chains us down. Today's guest is Joshua Sheets from radical
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.080]   personalfinance.com, who really digs into how to handle money in a radical way. It's not just the
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.960]   70s. It's money today, but it's still radical. Parts of this episode might be a little heady
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.160]   for some of us, like me, who don't necessarily get all the talk about assets and total cost of
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.240]   ownership calculations, et cetera, et cetera. But stick with Paul and Joshua here as the tips
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.680]   Joshua gives at the end are fantastic and quite applicable for anyone listening. And listen for
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.200]   it. Paul almost gets Joshua to say that home ownership is a bad investment. You have to listen
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.000]   to the whole episode to get the full truth, people. This is episode number 35 of the Nomad
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.800]   Together podcast. To get the show notes for this episode, please go to nomadtogether.com/financial.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:36.880]   iTunes and Stitcher Reviews. Fantastic show by Amar V. from India. One can live a life that is
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.720]   not as bound by the rules, such as a steady location, a permanent home, and schooling of
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.440]   kids. This should not be a reason to stay in one location. In today's day and age, an internet
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.680]   nomad is a possibility, and this show proves that. The hosts are not the only ones doing it. Their
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.240]   guests are as well. Great Show by MadYali289 from the United States. This is an amazing show with
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.040]   tons of valuable content that has inspired me to make it work and travel more. And Can't Wait
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.880]   to Hear More by Brenda Lommely from the United States. My husband and I plan to start traveling
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.840]   together in a few months, and this podcast has given us some great ideas and insight. Thank you,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.680]   Amar and MadYali and Brenda for your reviews. We appreciate it. Keep it coming, people.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.000]   Each week, we read your five-star iTunes and Stitcher reviews here on the show. We'd love it
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.880]   if you said thank you by simply writing a review for us on iTunes or Stitcher. Head on over to
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.000]   nomadtogether.com/podcast to see how to give a review. We're the Cortmans. We are deep in the
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.360]   jungles of the Amazon. Just kidding. We're still in San Miguel de Allende. Every week, you're going
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.520]   to hear us say that for a while, so I thought I'd just shake it up a bit. Loving it here. Still
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.320]   seeing some good thunderstorms and working on some health issues, and then we'll see where we go from
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.920]   there. But San Miguel de Allende, it's only 10 miles from the Texas border, Laredo, Texas, right
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.800]   there. So, hey, you know, it's a really nice little trip down into Mexico and a really nice little
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.920]   place to stay. So, y'all are looking for like a weekend getaway? Come on down here and visit us.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   We're staying at an RV park that's connected to a hotel, and it's a great place to come visit. So,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.880]   we're going to be here for a couple more months, probably. So, hey, stop on down.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.360]   Okay, let's get down to business. Let's learn more about how you can save,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.640]   spend less, and is home ownership really worth it?
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.160]   Welcome, Joshua Sheets. Thanks for being here on the Nomad Together podcast.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.360]   And the little that I know, you have two kids, a wife, and you're Mr. Money Man, right?
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.800]   Something like that. Two dogs, too. But yes, I'm married. I have a two and a half year old son
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.640]   and a one year old daughter. And we live here in West Palm Beach, Florida, and I run a business
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.240]   called Radical Personal Finance. Radical Personal Finance. Not just
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.120]   personal finance, but to the nth degree that it's so radical or because it's different than
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.600]   everything else. I was looking for a descriptive title for my show and my platform. And when I
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.200]   came up with the idea of radical, I realized it fit just about everything that is important to me.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.400]   To give you an idea, I talk about everything from the extremes of... I did a show one time,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.840]   very popular, on the lessons that we can learn from dumpster divers and vagabonds and hobos.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.040]   And I've done shows on how to do multimillion dollar estate planning. And so, I'd cover all
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.880]   of the extremes. And I also have some extreme and unusual political viewpoints. I have unusual
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.400]   religious viewpoints. I have unusual perspectives on many things. And so, what I try to do is I seek
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   out all of the interesting extreme cases, and then I like to present that information to my audience
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.200]   so that they can look at their own situation, learn from what other people are doing, and then
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.120]   figure out what some of the tactics and tools are that they can apply to their own situation.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.080]   So yes, radical in every sense. Well, welcome to being the extreme and the
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.360]   outcast and those weird people on the fringes, because our audience is definitely that. We've
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.160]   given up the American dream and set out to do something completely strange and different,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.080]   although it's becoming more of the norm now that it's more acceptable to sell everything,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.280]   quit your job and live as hobos. But what's really interesting, and I think my audience is going,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.720]   "Wait a minute. So where's the catch? Is this guy location independent? Why do you have a personal
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.480]   finance coach on the podcast?" And so, I do want to run that through. I'm going to ask,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.320]   are you location independent? I actually am. And for many years,
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.800]   even though I live in West Palm Beach and I live in a fairly traditional looking lifestyle,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.960]   for many years, I've had a goal to build a location independent lifestyle. And I've been
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   working towards it for many years, and I have achieved it with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.960]   I started the business two years ago. In the beginning, I had a clear idea of what I was
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.920]   working towards. I didn't know if it were possible or not. But today, I am working from my third
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.400]   bedroom here in my house, and it doesn't really matter where in the world I'm working from.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.160]   I can do my business anywhere in the world. And that's been a major part of my planning
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.240]   all along the way. - So do you sell the house
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.600]   and leave West Palm Beach or just stay there and enjoy?
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.240]   - I don't think so. Neither of those, actually. We did actually sell our house about a year ago.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.280]   We sold our house, and that was a tremendous blessing and I've thoroughly enjoyed moving
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.040]   into a rental apartment. But although I could go and travel the world, it's not something that is
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.320]   on a full-time basis. It's not something that's a priority for me to pursue aggressively for a
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.600]   few reasons. I've been a lot of places and at this point in time, I don't really have a desire to go
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.720]   and be on the road full-time. I do enjoy traveling, but the full-time kind of going out for
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.440]   months or years at a time is not particularly important to me right now. My kids are very young.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.640]   So at this stage, I'm working to build a business and build many things in my family and in my kids.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.160]   And then the reason that I live in West Palm Beach is not necessarily because it's my favorite place
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.680]   in the world, although I am from here, but I feel like this is where God wants me to be at this
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.160]   point in time. And so I don't feel free to do anything else, even though I could do it
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   financially. I don't feel that that's what I should be doing. So I'm here and I'm pretty
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.240]   content for now. I do think in the future at some point in time, we'll go and build the full-time
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.920]   on the road lifestyle. At the very least, I intend to take my kids to all 50 state capitals and do a
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.240]   tour of the US and show them around there. And we do enjoy traveling. I just bought a camper van.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.920]   And one of the goals with what I do see appropriate to our lifestyle right now is I do a decent amount
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.840]   of traveling for my work. And whether that's going to industry conferences or things like that,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.960]   I'd like to be able to take my family with me. And I don't particularly like the whole jet
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.640]   traveling. Let me get on an airplane, go away and stay at for five days in a hotel,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.240]   leave my family at home. I enjoy taking them with me. And so I actually just bought a couple
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.280]   weeks ago, I bought a camper van, a small class B RV, a road trek camper van. I've been fixing a
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.520]   couple of things that need to be fixed on that. And I think in the future that will allow us to
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   do much more of the integrated family travel. It kills two birds with one stone. If you study the
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.680]   IRS regulations on travel, it's fairly simple to be able to use some of the expenses that are
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.000]   associated with traveling to business conference, things like that, to deduct the business aspect of
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.560]   those expenses, which helps to defray some of the costs for my personal travel. We will be doing
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.480]   much more of that type of travel, just not planning to go out on the road for years at a time at this
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.760]   point. - Understood. So what's your background? Do you come at this from a registered investment
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.880]   advisor? Are you an accountant? Are you a lawyer? Or are you totally self-taught and don't have any
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.040]   credentials? - I began with a deep interest in personal finance when I was a kid. I always wanted
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.240]   to be rich. - Nice. - So I was always reading books on personal finance and money and investing and
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.480]   things like that. I went to college. After college, I was working for a marketing company, doing
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.800]   market research in the corporate environment. And I quickly learned that the corporate world was not
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.600]   for me. I wound up getting laid off from that job. And while I was deciding what to do next,
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.800]   I was having lunch with my former boss. And I was telling him the five different criteria that I had
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.160]   for a job or a business that I was interested in. One of those, as is appropriate to this
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.480]   conversation, was that I didn't want to be stuck in one place. I didn't like to be stuck in one
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.960]   office. And I was hoping that I would be able to build something that would go beyond even one
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.080]   geographic town. So that was one of my criteria from when I first got out of college. He wound
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.440]   up suggesting that I go into the financial planning business and did a lot of research and
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.400]   realized that the financial planning business would fit many of my goals. So in 2008, I joined
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.160]   the financial planning business, starting with a company called Northwestern Mutual. And I spent
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.440]   six years there with Northwestern Mutual until I wound up starting Radical Personal Finance and
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.560]   decided that Radical Personal Finance was much closer to my skill set and my personal goals.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.600]   And so in July of 2014, I left Northwestern Mutual. What I was doing was mainstream
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.400]   practicing as a financial advisor. I sold life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.560]   insurance. I sold investments. I became a certified financial planner. I actually, at this point,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.080]   have a master's degree in financial planning, certified financial planner, chartered life
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.560]   underwriter, chartered financial consultant. I've done a lot of academic study in the areas of
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.280]   financial planning. The mission that I have with Radical Personal Finance is to connect the world
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.160]   of formal academic financial planning with the world of people who are actually trying to go out
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.440]   and achieve something unique and special. And it often seems like there's this great gap in the
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.720]   financial discussion where you have what I call mainstream personal finance advice. Hey, put money
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.560]   in your 401(k) so you can retire at 65. Open a 529 account for your kids' college, blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.360]   And then there's this kind of fringe perspective of people who are interested in building more
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   aggressive financial goals. And that can be everything from somebody saying, "I want to
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.920]   build a real estate portfolio and be a millionaire at a young age," or "I want to retire at 30," or
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.520]   "Hey, we don't have any money, but we want to go travel the world. How do we do that?"
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.240]   And I believe all those things are possible. And what I didn't see was anybody merging those
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.200]   two worlds. Because, for example, if somebody wants to go and figure out how to improve their
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.760]   lifestyle and improve their family life, doing good tax planning is going to make a tremendous
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.880]   difference in that. Depending on the situation, I would guess that 20 to 40% of your income is
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.440]   going to taxes. Well, you can make a substantial difference in that, but you can't do it by
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.760]   dreaming about something ethereal. You need to do it by sitting down and looking and figuring out
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.440]   where is our money going and what are some strategies to adjust it. So what I try to do
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.400]   is merge these worlds, this aggressive goal achievement dreams. You give me any goal,
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.360]   we can work out a plan to get there. But we also need some academic integrity from the world of
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.640]   financial planning. Because at the end of the day, you need a dollar to buy a plane ticket,
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.680]   you need a dollar to buy your meal at night. And that dollar is going to need to be earned in a way
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.920]   that is conducive to your lifestyle. And it's going to need to be managed in a way that allows
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.960]   you to achieve the ultimate end. A couple of things before we get into specifics for our audience.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.840]   What makes your recommendations and such different from those of like, say,
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.240]   probably the most popular one our audience would know, Dave from Financial Peace University.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.880]   Dave Ramsey.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.960]   Dave Ramsey. What's the difference between what you're presenting and what the big Dave is?
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.520]   I wouldn't say there's so much difference of what I'm presenting. Listen, money advice is
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.680]   money advice. Dave Ramsey's slogan is we give you the same financial advice that your grandmother
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.760]   does, only we keep our teeth in. That's his joke that he does every day. You're not going to get
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.120]   some unique, different money advice. In fact, I came up with a framework that's a total of 10 words
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:25.440]   and five points under which I can explain every single aspect of personal financial advice.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.160]   So financial advice is actually quite simple. Now, of course, we may disagree on a few steps,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.640]   but that's just normal. Most of those things are talking points. Whether you have to pay off your
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.400]   debt, you only have a thousand dollar emergency fund for baby step one for Dave Ramsey's plan,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   and then pay off all your debt, or whether you should use debt, those things are workable.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.000]   I would say the biggest thing that would differentiate me and my message from Dave
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.240]   would be two things that are important. Number one, I don't try to approach the subject of
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.960]   financial advice as telling people what they should do. This actually hurts me with regard
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.360]   to the idea that my message is not as clear as, for example, Dave's is. Dave's message is very
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   clear, and that's helpful. I don't tell people what to do. I tell them how to think about what
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.320]   they're trying to do. And so I try to put myself in different situations and say, if this were your
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.040]   goal, here is what you would need to do. If this were your worldview, here is how you would approach
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.520]   that question. If this were your philosophy, here's how that philosophy would affect your life.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.800]   Number two is I'm much less mainstream than Dave Ramsey is. In every business and every kind of
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.280]   thing, you have to deal with a specific situation. So Dave Ramsey's avatar is a median income,
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:33.520]   earning household, husband and wife, earning $45,000 each, or household income anywhere from
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.880]   $40,000 to $80,000, two kids, young kids, credit card debt, car payments, etc. And so his message
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.640]   is going to be tailored to that. Well, there are a lot of situations of people that doesn't serve.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.120]   And so I try to serve all of those aspects by giving people ideas and information that's
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.960]   applicable in a broader context. We've got a lot of folks in our audience who are sitting there,
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.880]   working their nine to five and listening to us on the weekends or evenings or whatever, and
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.600]   trying to make ends meet to be able to, I don't know, sell their house or fly around the world.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.320]   And they're like, how do they do this without burning through their savings account? What
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.920]   ideas would you have for them? Say they have a desk job, location dependent. I'd say they're
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.320]   a little bit above that median income. They're probably both bringing in 60, or if they only
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.240]   have a single working parent, they're bringing in 60, 70. What sort of suggestions do you have
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.760]   for them? What would you say? So let me start by giving you the framework, how I think about money,
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.640]   because I think it'll be really useful, especially in this context. There are five points to it. And
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.600]   the first three are the only things that you can actually do with money. So step one is
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   increase income. When it comes to actually physical tactical steps, one of the things you
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.080]   always have to remember is you can always increase income and people often forget about that.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.400]   That's actually one of the most powerful things that you can focus on, increasing income. Number
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.680]   two is decrease expenses. That's the other thing that you can do. You can't predict what Coca-Cola
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.760]   is going to do. You can't predict what the valuation is going to be between the dollar
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   and the pound, such as when is the most advantageous time to travel to Europe, which
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.360]   can do is decrease expenses. Number three is invest wisely. Those are the three things that you do
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.000]   with money that will make the difference, the biggest difference. So I think of that as a
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.480]   triangle where you go continually around those three things, increasing income, decreasing
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.280]   expenses and investing wisely. Number four is avoid catastrophe. I'll minimize the discussion
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.520]   on that right now. But basically, I think of that as simply putting on my disaster glasses
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.880]   and looking around and saying, what's the worst thing that could happen to me? And that's where
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.440]   you cover everything from life insurance to having savings account to if you're traveling,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.520]   you think about buying the trip insurance and you make a decision on whether or not you need that
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.320]   based upon what's the worst thing that could happen. And then number five is optimize lifestyle.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:55.360]   And here's where I think the biggest wins will be for many listeners. There's an ideal way for each
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.000]   person to earn an income, to spend their money and to invest their money. There's an ideal way
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.960]   for them to do that. You can earn forty thousand dollars a year doing a job you hate or you can
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.280]   earn forty thousand dollars a year doing a job you love. The financial impact of that is going to be
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.320]   the same on your financial plan. But the experience is going to be very different in the same way you
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.120]   can earn forty thousand dollars a year doing a desk job in Chicago, Illinois, or you can earn
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.600]   forty thousand dollars a year working virtually with a business that you can run through your
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.400]   laptop sitting on a beach in Mexico. The money will be the same, but your experience of earning
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.960]   the money will be dramatically different. So under the scenario that you're presenting me with,
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.080]   I would advise somebody who's in a situation like that to start to take a comprehensive view
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.000]   of their life, a holistic view. First thing with money goals is to get very clear on what the
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.720]   actual goal is. If somebody's goal is to be able to set up a location independent lifestyle so that
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.840]   they can travel with their family, that is a great goal because it's specific and it's clear.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.760]   Next step, on what budget? You need to know what that budget is because if you need a budget of
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.280]   ten thousand dollars a month or a budget of three thousand dollars a month, those will be a
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.640]   dramatically different set of options. The best thing that somebody can do in that situation is
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.280]   work to transition their income from a location dependent scenario to a location independent
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.320]   style of income. And this has never been easier in the history of the world. There are so many
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.800]   jobs and so many businesses that can be done on a location independent perspective, and the trend is
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.760]   only in that direction. The trend is increasing where more and more people are working from
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.200]   different locations. I have a number of people that work with me in my business. I don't care
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.680]   where they are. And in fact, I don't want to even go to the perspective of hiring people,
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.320]   especially not in the United States. When you get to the cost and the regulations that are involved,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.040]   it is so tremendously expensive to hire people and to put office space and to handle the taxes
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.880]   and to cover the health insurance and all that stuff. It's much easier for me to work with people
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.640]   in other places. The way you get there is you look at your skills and you look around and you say,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.800]   "Is there a way that I can imagine this type of work succeeding in a location independent way?"
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.520]   For some businesses, that's relatively simple. If you are programming software or you're involved
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.240]   in anything where you're staring at a computer for most of your workday, you can do that on
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.320]   a location independent basis. We could give tips and strategies for how to get into that. We'll
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.560]   save that for another time. If your workday consists of you primarily looking at a computer,
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   you can do that on a location independent basis, and it might take you a year to transition to be
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.320]   able to do that. If your workday involves you doing something else that's not staring at a
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.440]   computer, then you might need to think a little bit more creatively. But even in these occupations,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.160]   there are tons of ways that people can do it. If somebody is a plumber, there's no reason why you
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.240]   have to be a plumber 12 months a year. You could be a plumber six months a year, six months on,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.360]   six months off. If you're a builder, there's no reason why you have to build houses in West Palm
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.320]   Beach, Florida. You can build houses anywhere you want to go. If you have the skills or are trying
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.040]   to learn the skills of a farmer and your long-term goal is to go and be a farmer, you can volunteer
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.960]   as a woofer on various organic farms all around the world. You can arrange many, many ways for
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.040]   you to travel. You can work along the way. Believe it or not, people earn their income in every
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.600]   country in the world. Now, some countries it's easier, but people earn a living in every country
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   in the world. There's bartenders in every country in the world. So if you've got the skills of a
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.720]   bartender, you can certainly earn a living. And I think that's the simplest place to focus,
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.040]   is to recognize that I don't have to do this job here where I am. I can get a job and do a
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.160]   different job anywhere I want to be. Then from there, you can go back to some of the basics that
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.040]   might free you up. The next thing to do is once you get clear on a goal, recognize that first and
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.160]   foremost, you want to get the income thing figured out. Now, recognize that there are a couple ways
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.960]   to do that. You could get the income thing figured out by working along the way, or you can get the
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.840]   income thing figured out by saving money to be able to fund an adventure. And here's where you
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:02.400]   have a big difference between, do I want to travel into perpetuity or do I want to travel for a year?
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.240]   Traveling for a year is super, super easy. Here's all you need to do. Live on 50% of your current
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.520]   income, save 50% of your income, and go and you'll have a year on the road. For every year that you
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.480]   save 50% of your income, you buy yourself a year of freedom. It's as simple as that. And so where
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:24.240]   that should direct your attention is to your expenses. Many people could put themselves in
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.480]   a situation where they could become completely financially independent and be able to travel
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.640]   into perpetuity in anywhere from seven to 15 years, depending on the approach. If you want to do it
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.600]   faster, the simplest way to do it is to save a very high amount of your income. And so some of
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.320]   your listeners might have excellent jobs. You might be earning six-figure salaries. Maybe you have
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.480]   a dual-income household. Well, you give me a household with an income of $150,000,
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:55.520]   and we just put the monthly living budget on, say, $2,500, $3,000 a month by making some simple
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.920]   adjustments in lifestyle. And in under a decade, that person can be completely financially
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.320]   independent and be able to travel into perpetuity. I've interviewed a number of people who've pursued
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.680]   this plan on my show. There are a number of people who've done that. That's a very simple thing to do.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.960]   Are you talking like retire in 10 years?
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.840]   Absolutely.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.040]   Viable option for anybody to do that in 10 years?
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:23.520]   Anybody. I am profoundly convinced that anybody who wants to and who has some basic skill,
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.280]   I can't solve the problems of, say, somebody who's mentally handicapped, things like that.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.920]   But normal people can retire in 10 years, and it's a very simple function.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   It's a function of your income and your expenses. See, what happens is most people
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.560]   think that, "Well, if I'm saving 10 or 15% of my income, then I'm in good shape." Well,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.480]   you don't have to save 10 or 15% of your income. You can save 75% of your income.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.840]   The reality is that if you save 75% of your income and you invest that money,
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.280]   you'll be financially independent in under a decade. But most people don't think of saving
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.640]   75% of their income. A couple of resources people have interviewed on my show,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.720]   and this is what Radical Personal Finance is all about. A super extreme one would be
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.800]   Jacob Lund Fisker at Early Retirement Extreme. If your audience is not familiar with that,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.360]   they'll find that to be interesting and useful. He has a book which is called Early Retirement
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.760]   Extreme. It's one of my favorite personal finance books. Definitely a recommendation.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.080]   There are two episodes of the show on Radical Personal Finance in the early days where I
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.800]   reviewed the book in detail. Also, I've done extensive interviews with Jacob Lund Fisker.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.320]   Another very useful resource would be somebody like the most popular personal finance blogger
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:36.560]   that I'm aware of is Mr. Money Mustache, MrMoneyMustache.com. He is an excellent writer,
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.680]   and he's done a great job at talking about some of the ways to accomplish this.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.160]   This is the way to financial independence. It's called extreme savings by saving a very high
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.760]   percentage of your income. But the way the math works, and I've got an episode and I'll look it
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.440]   up in a second here and give you the episode number, but the way the math works is that if
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.800]   you save a very high percentage of your income, you'll be able to maintain that income for a very
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.760]   long period of time without needing to earn more money. The reason it is, if you think about this,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.920]   if you are earning $10,000 a month and you're living on $2,000 a month, I'm not promising that
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:16.240]   by saving 80% of your income, I'm not promising that you can cover $10,000 a month of expenses.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:22.880]   What you're actually doing is you are covering $2,000 a month of expenses. And so that's why
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.480]   there's a very simple mathematical approach that high savings gives you freedom.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:35.360]   Could we look at it this way that making huge sacrifices for 10 years will allow you to live
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.560]   a life of financial freedom, but you'll still have to make those same sacrifices because you'll still
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.200]   only be living off of $2,000 to $3,000 a month?
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.280]   I wouldn't necessarily call them sacrifices. I think that's a limiting way to look at it.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.840]   The people who pursue this approach generally don't view themselves as sacrificing.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.520]   Generally, the people who view this approach are looking at it and realizing,
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.160]   "Look, you're telling me I don't have to go to work and you're telling me that I have freedom
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.880]   to be able to do whatever I want to do." It's a really powerful concept.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:10.960]   So for me, I live in a very inexpensive apartment, not because I can't afford to live in a more
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   expensive apartment, but because I don't value what the more expensive apartment or the more
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.000]   expensive house gives me. And so the key is to adjust your mindset. If you go into it with a
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.120]   typical US-American idea that spending less money is deprivation, you'll never successfully retire
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.680]   early. You'll never be able to achieve it because you'll always be viewing it as deprivation.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.920]   But if you go into it thinking about it from the perspective of abundance,
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.680]   in the sense that you gain an abundance of time and abundance of freedom,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.960]   the reason I won't give up my $1,000 a month apartment or the reason I won't give up my $500
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.480]   car—I drive a $500 car, a $5,000 minivan for my family and a $500 car that I drive—the reason I
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:56.000]   won't give those things up is because what they get me is worth so much more than fancier stuff.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.400]   What they give me is time. They give me the ability to say no to anybody I want to. They
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.160]   give me the ability to work at home and do something I care about, whether or not the
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:10.400]   money is—and not to make decisions for purely financial reasons. And so people who approach this
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.120]   are not looking at it from the perspective of deprivation. They're looking at it from
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.920]   the perspective of gaining something valuable. Now, you don't have to just do it on $2,000 a
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.480]   month. I try to use small numbers, relatively small numbers, to make these things accessible.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.160]   But there's no reason why you can't earn half a million dollars a year. There's lots of people
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.560]   that earn a half a million dollars a year. But usually when I say things like that, I lose people
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.120]   and they just don't identify with that. So I like to use examples of somebody earning $80,000 a year.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.760]   You don't own a house and you're renting. What's the financial decision there?
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.720]   I thought owning a house is a good investment and mortgages are great investments.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.960]   - So go and listen to a couple episodes on the show. I hate to sound like I'm plugging my podcast,
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   but a couple of entire episodes dedicated to this topic on radical personal finance,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.480]   specifically analyzing the numbers. One of the most important calculations you should make is
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:09.600]   to actually look at what the expenses are of your house and what your house is actually costing you.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.640]   Most people who approach their personal finances with the idea that owning a house is a good
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.840]   investment are getting bamboozled. Specific examples from my own situation of the simple
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:27.520]   math behind it. When I owned a house, I bought the house for about $225,000 and I put 20%
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.160]   down. So I basically put $50,000 down into the house and I had a mortgage and my mortgage payment
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:40.720]   was $1,250 a month. Now of that mortgage payment, the $1,250 a month, about $250 a month was
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.240]   actually going towards principal reduction. The rest of it was going to taxes, interest,
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:53.200]   and insurance. So from the simplest analysis that my rent is $1,000 a month now, I was able to
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:27:00.880]   transition from $1,000 of expenses on my house to $1,000 of expenses with my rental payment.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:07.440]   And most importantly, I was able to free up and gain back the income and the interest that I could
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.360]   earn from that $50,000. Now I'm not saying that you shouldn't consider your primary residence and
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.120]   try to figure out how to make money off of it. You can do it. And I wound up, I sold the house,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.440]   made a nice profit on it. That was part of the ideas. That profit was tax-free. I lived in the
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.400]   house for over two years. And anytime you've owned a personal residence for over two years,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.000]   you can gain up to $500,000 for a couple married filing jointly on their taxes and paid no income
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.480]   taxes on the money. And so I was able to free up some money and take some tax-free income from the
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:43.760]   house. But I spend less here in the apartment financially than I did on the pure cost of owning
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:49.280]   the house. Now my apartment is smaller than the house was. Comparable rental rates on a house
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.920]   would have been something around $1,800 a month. So if I were moving in and renting a house,
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.480]   then I had to redo the math. But here was what made the biggest difference. For the lifestyle
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.360]   of our family, our lifestyle in this rental apartment is far better than my lifestyle was
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.680]   in the house. As I'm building this new business on the house was requiring a tremendous amount of
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.480]   time, constantly fixing things, constantly just dealing with the normal aspects of home ownership.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.560]   Now in a rental apartment, I don't need to do that stuff. And so we actually like the floor plan.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.120]   We like the amenities of the apartment better than the house. And it frees up the time. So
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.400]   tonight when I finish up this interview, I can just say, "Hey, let's go to the beach or take
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.000]   the paddle boards out. And I don't have to worry about fixing the water softener. It's somebody
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.440]   else's problem." And so there are ways you need to actually go through and calculate the actual
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.520]   cost. And there are a couple of episodes that will teach the audience how to do that in the
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.760]   archives of Radical Personal Finance. So by cost, you're saying total cost,
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.040]   time, emotional involvement, that sort of thing? Right. Total cost. And I'm being very specific
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.720]   on the financial aspect as well as other things. But I'm saying you can do a side-by-side financial
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:58.160]   calculation. And most people don't do that. See, the way most people imagine the rent versus own
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.400]   scenario is let me use those numbers from a comparable house. They look at it and say,
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:08.720]   "Well, if I rent for $1,800 a month, but I can have a mortgage payment of $1,250 a month,
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.520]   then I'm automatically going to be better off. Because if I rent, I'm losing $1,800 a month.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.520]   But if I own the house, I'm building equity." So a couple of major mistakes that people make.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.160]   Number one, they assume that they're building equity with their entire mortgage payment.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.760]   It's factually incorrect. Of my $1,250 mortgage payment here in Florida, about $600 of that was
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:34.720]   for taxes and insurance. And those taxes and insurance are a pure cost. You never recoup any
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.520]   of that money. The balance of the $650 payment was a payment on a mortgage. However, that mortgage
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   payment, due to the way that this was a traditionally amortizing 30-year fixed-rate
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.280]   mortgage, due to the way mortgages are amortized, of that, only about $250 in the beginning years
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.920]   of the mortgage payment are actually going to a reduction of principal. The rest of it is all
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.920]   interest, which is pure cost. So from a financial cost, it's actually the difference in that
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:09.600]   situation would be I'm spending $1,800 a month on rent, or I'm spending $1,000 a month on the
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.960]   cost of owning a house. The next calculation you have to do is what are the costs of ownership?
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.040]   When you own a house, there are constant costs of ownership. That's fine. It's the same with
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.560]   everything. I'm not saying people shouldn't buy houses, but you should calculate the cost.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.640]   Whether it's a new $3,000 water softener system, or a new $10,000 roof, or a new $8,000 septic
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.840]   tank, or a new $3,000 air conditioner, there are always lots of costs. There are both costs for
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.720]   maintenance items and also for improvements and ways to make things better. You're calculating
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.040]   the cost of a fence. So you've got to calculate the cost of those maintenance items in terms of
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:48.480]   dollar figures and with actual time. And the other one, the big one that most people miss,
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.240]   is you need to calculate what the opportunity cost is that you're giving up on the foregone
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.200]   investment earnings of the money that you're putting down as a down payment. So I put $50,000
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   down on the property, and let's say that I were earning 6% interest per year. That's $3,000 per
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.560]   year of cost that I'm giving up because I don't have the money invested, because I had to put the
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.360]   money down into my personal house. That's interest I'm not getting because I put the money into a
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.440]   down payment. Now, yes, I do own the house, and I have the potential to experience appreciation
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:26.480]   of the property or depreciation of the property, but that's interest that I'm not getting.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.880]   And so when you actually line these things up, what you find is that the difference in cost
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.640]   between renting and owning for many people is much closer than they would otherwise say. And then when
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.600]   you add on the other lifestyle factors, like I mentioned, time freedom, location freedom,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.320]   the ability to simply move to a different job, the ability to live closer to a job, the ability
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.200]   to move countries if you want to, to go get a better job, those things are compelling.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:56.640]   And that's the big picture. To apply it, you have to do an analysis in a local market,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.160]   because in some markets, rents are dramatically higher than our ownership costs, and in some
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.000]   markets, the other way. And so I'm not giving blanket advice, but I am saying,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.840]   don't buy the lie that owning a house is a great investment.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.560]   Even in your situation, just let's stick with West Palm Beach and all that.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.120]   Sure.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:21.440]   You're talking about right now in the early years of a mortgage, but if you stick it out for 30
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.920]   years, those numbers change. You don't have to pay the interest, you're paying more to principal,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.800]   and you don't have to pay for the insurance. And so those numbers dramatically change,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:38.480]   you know, 10, 15, 20 years into a 30-year mortgage. And if you compare apples to apples,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   even on your cheaper, smaller apartment, over 30 years, when you're done in the apartment,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.760]   after 30 years, you have no asset. And when you're done in 30 years in the house, you have
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:56.240]   the house free and clear as an asset. But even still, what I'm guessing that you're going to say
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:01.120]   is the total cost of ownership, the financial side of the total cost of ownership,
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.680]   all of the upkeep and maintenance that you had to do on that house over the 30 years,
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.040]   it'll be closer to the same loss, if you will, of renting?
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   I wouldn't necessarily say that, although I think it would be important to consider it.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.280]   Because if, in a scenario like you described, if you had two identical houses, two brand new
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.680]   houses side by side, this person is in a very healthy financial situation, because we didn't
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.560]   even get to the risk factor. So many people buy houses and their houses wind up sinking them when
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.800]   they lose their job or run out of money and have an unexpected illness or something like that,
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.320]   because it's very risky to buy a house, because now you're on the hook for a tremendous amount
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.800]   of money. But if you were going to put them side by side, and you were going to give me a scenario
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.160]   where a family is going to live there for 30 years, I would say most likely buying the house
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:54.320]   would come out to be financially superior. But that's not the normal experience for most people,
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.520]   especially not in our modern world. Very few people live in a house for 30 years. Very few
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.560]   people stay in one property for a long time. And my example, in my case, would be a good example
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.120]   of that. When I bought the house that I bought, see, the decision you make with housing is one
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.680]   of the most important decisions that will drive your overall wealth. If a listener is interested
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.840]   in studying the academic research on that, start with the work of Dr. Thomas Stanley, who wrote
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.560]   the popular book, The Millionaire Next Door. The reason the housing decision drives everything else
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.080]   is because housing is often associated with lifestyle. If I buy a house in a middle class,
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.880]   blue collar type of neighborhood, it'll be perfectly acceptable for me to park a Toyota
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:38.240]   Camry and a Ford F-150 pickup truck in my front yard. It'll be perfectly acceptable for me to go
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.560]   over to my neighbor's house for an afternoon barbecue and barbecue some ribs and smoke some
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:48.400]   cigars in the back room. But if I buy a house in an upper middle class neighborhood, my F-150 and
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.080]   my five-year-old Camry are going to look out of place. And so I'm going to feel the pressure
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.440]   to increase the cars that are in the driveway. Now I need to park a Mercedes and a Lincoln in
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.160]   the driveway. And now all of a sudden, instead of going over for a backyard barbecue with a Budweiser
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.360]   and a cigar, now all of a sudden we're going to go down to the club. And my $10 evening turned
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.200]   into a $100 evening because these are the friends that we're associating with. And now my kids,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.560]   instead of their friends in the neighborhood going to the local government school where we're not
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   paying anything out of pocket, now my kids are going to be associating with people who are in
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.800]   private schools. So the actual housing decision that you make will drive many other areas of
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.840]   your spending. My example is when I chose the house, I chose a house that was half a mile from
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.560]   my office. My office and my job at the time I thought were very, very stable. I've been there
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:37.680]   for five years. We had a 15-year lease on the office. I chose a house that was half a mile from
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.880]   my office so I could walk to work. Diminishing commuting expenses is a tremendous place to save
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.440]   money. Most listeners, if you have a long commute, you should seriously look at adjusting that.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:52.720]   For anybody, commuting expenses are non-deductible expenses. And driving is expensive. It's expensive
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   in money and in time. So it's better to trade non-deductible high expenses of vehicle maintenance
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.440]   for deductible interest costs and buy a more expensive house that's closer to your office.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.280]   For us, it allowed me to walk to work every day and we were able to get rid of a second car.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.760]   So we chose that carefully. Bought a house that was big enough but not too big, big enough to
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.080]   handle kids and family, but not so big that we had a lot of wasted space. Bought a house that
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.000]   was nice enough but not too nice. It wasn't a starter house. I didn't think we were going to
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.120]   have to move up and out in three years because the friction. Buying and selling houses is very
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:30.160]   expensive for most people. So you want to minimize the frequency with which you buy and sell houses
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.960]   because of the friction cost, the sales expenses, fixing the thing up, repainting it, fixing the
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.440]   things needed to do it. You want to stay put. If you're going to own a house, your best bet is to
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.280]   generally stay put for a long period of time. So we bought a house that was nice enough. We'd be
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.600]   happy there for a long time, but not so nice that we needed to drive Mercedes and BMWs.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.360]   And we bought a house that fit what we wanted. It was half an acre right in the middle of the city,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.320]   walking distance to great stores and to the library. It was what we defined as perfect.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.760]   I told my wife before we bought it, I said, "I think this will be a 40-year house for us."
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.320]   Well, two and a half years later, I quit my job, closed one business, started a new business,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.440]   and our life was completely turned upside down. I never expected that. But those things happened.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.360]   And so I moved into the house thinking it was going to be a 40-year house, and I sold it with
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.240]   less than three years of ownership. I think that's the normal case for most people. A lengthy story,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.920]   just to point out that who's the person that you know who actually lives in a house for 30 years?
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:29.520]   They exist. Not saying it's a bad idea, but for most people, it's not going to happen.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.040]   They're going to move after a few years. I want to be very clear on the point, Paul.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.960]   I'm not saying that renting is financially superior to owning. I am saying that you need
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:45.760]   to approach the calculation much more carefully than most people approach it. And I'm saying that
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:51.200]   owning a house is not necessarily a good investment. The reason it seems to be a good investment for
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.960]   most people is because most people don't invest or save any money other than what they're forced
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:02.320]   to invest or save in their house. But that's their choice. They're choosing not to save other money.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.920]   They're choosing not to invest other money. I think that's their choice, and they can do that.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.720]   But recognize that it wasn't buying the house that made the difference and made them wealthy.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.600]   It was the fact that they actually bought an asset and they paid it off over time. Well,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.080]   you can do that living in an apartment and buying rental houses. I'd much rather live in an apartment
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.400]   and buy rental houses and see somebody. If I were giving financial advice to a young,
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.240]   enthusiastic, highly motivated person who wants to build wealth, I'd tell them,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.840]   "Don't buy a house unless you're doing it with what we call house hacking, where you're filling
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.600]   up all the spare bedrooms with renting them out and things like that. That can work really well
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.680]   because you get great financing rates on residential mortgages. So that can work."
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.000]   But in general, I'd tell somebody, "Rent a cheap apartment and buy rental houses. And then when
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.560]   you own 10 rental houses and you've got $10,000 a month rolling in, then go and buy yourself a
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:56.080]   fancy house." Your primary house is not best viewed as an asset. It's best viewed as a
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.880]   consumption item. Nothing wrong with consuming money. Just don't confuse your consumption items
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.920]   with your investments. Fast forward a little bit. We've got folks who have made these decisions.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.440]   They're now out on the road. They're living a life of location independence. They have whatever
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:18.720]   assets floating around in different places. But this whole concept of retirement is elusive.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:24.000]   A lot of people I've met are living within their means. So they're not going into debt.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.480]   They're not living a typical Western mindset of where they're spending more than they can
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.760]   or more than they should. But when it comes to actually investing and saving and that sort of
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:39.600]   thing, it's meager. And they really don't know what vehicles to put their investment in.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:45.520]   Now, we have lots of other people who are making plenty of money and they're looking for rental
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.640]   properties and that sort of thing to actually make serious business investments into. And also
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:58.400]   Amazon FBA and that sort of thing, where you can tie your money into an appreciating asset. But
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.040]   what would you recommend for somebody who's location independent, living a lifestyle and
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.720]   thinking about retirement, assuming, you know, those of us from the States that Social Security
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.880]   isn't going to be there, it's kind of social insecurity. What would you recommend?
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.360]   Before answering the question, I'd like to just step back one point and then I'll answer the
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:23.760]   question to the person who is considering embracing that type of lifestyle first,
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.080]   because I find that's where the biggest problem is. It's been my observation and experience
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.160]   working with people who have embraced an unusual lifestyle, lifestyle of perpetual travel,
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.960]   things like that. It's been my experience that they don't have that question as much as the
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.320]   person who hasn't yet started on it. And I think retirement, the question of retirement and college
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:48.480]   is often something that keeps people mentally trapped. And so the first thing to do is to adjust
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:55.280]   your mindset and to realize that most people who are wealthy and can afford to retire don't actually
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   ever retire. And I say that partly from academic study and partly from just observation. And I
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.720]   challenge any listener of this show to look around at the wealthiest people that they know and ask
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.840]   themselves, are they retired? Now, you'll find some people that are retired, but my experience
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.240]   has been generally the people who can afford to retire usually don't because they're too busy
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:23.760]   doing something that they care about. And so they're too busy making an impact in their business.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.400]   They're too busy, you know, running for president of the United States. They're too busy working
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:34.080]   with a local charity and building houses. They're too busy with the affairs of their life to retire,
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:39.520]   and they don't want to retire. The whole idea that we've been sold of retirement being a positive
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:45.600]   goal is pretty much bunk. When retirement was first invented, people looked at it and said,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   why would anybody want to retire? Retirement was a penalty, not a reward. If somebody's interested
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.840]   in an in-depth discussion of that, there's a show in the archives of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.160]   something called the Untold History of Retirement, What They Never Told You. Retirement was invented
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.120]   as a penalty, as a way to lower the unemployment rate, and it was marketed to be this award.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.920]   And when you actually look at the satisfaction, life satisfaction of people who retire,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.480]   it varies. And that's why I've got to be careful not painting with too broad of a stroke.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.720]   It varies. Some people are very happy with it, but there are also a lot of people who find that
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   their sense of meaning and their sense of purpose is removed from them, and it's not particularly
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:27.280]   joyful. So to free yourself up, I just say, first, before you say, how do I save to retire?
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.560]   I recommend you say, what would I do if I knew I could never retire? I find that a powerful
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.200]   question to ask yourself, and I recommend it as a journaling exercise. What would I do if I knew
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.360]   I could never retire? Because what you might find is if you knew you could never retire,
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.880]   you'd go ahead and leave the corporate job that doesn't particularly meet your needs or meet your
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.800]   goals, and you might start the travel company specializing in exotic adventure travel to
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.920]   Patagonia. You might figure out a way to do it, because that'd be a job you wouldn't want to
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:43:00.160]   retire from. Now, for those who have figured out their work and have transitioned into something
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:05.040]   that they wouldn't want to retire from, say, the person you described, a traveler who's living on
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:09.600]   the road, earning an income, they're enjoying exactly what they're doing, I recommend not
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.920]   starting with an account or things like that, but starting with impact. What are you trying to
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.440]   invest for? Major mistake that people make is they don't figure out what they're trying to invest for
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.640]   before they start investing. They toss money in a 401(k) without figuring out, "Do I actually want
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.440]   to retire at 65 or after 59 and a half when I can access the money without a penalty? Do I actually
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.920]   want to invest in public-traded securities, or do I want to go and start a grass-fed beef farm
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   by renting some land from a guy in Missouri and starting to run cows on it, because that's the
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.000]   lifestyle that I'd like to have?" When you look at accounts and look at things like that, if you
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.520]   know what you're investing for, it'll be much simpler. In essence, you have a few options.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:52.960]   You have the ability to invest in paper assets. Paper assets are assets that are reflecting the
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.240]   underlying value of something else, like stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, things like this.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.960]   These are paper assets. You have the ability to invest in real assets, things like real estate,
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.840]   physical property, or you have the ability to invest in businesses, privately-run businesses,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.960]   which are almost a reflection of paper assets. Those are your basic options. I think that for
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:18.400]   somebody in a traveling lifestyle, you should, while you're considering buying an S&P 500 index
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.760]   fund over here, you should also be looking at the beautiful little beach spot on the beach in Panama
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.600]   and say, "You know what? A bed and breakfast, a high-end bed and breakfast would go really well
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:33.280]   here," or, "Hey, I could start an eco-farm here, and that would be really perfect, and I see the
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.680]   market where I could sell my products into. Let me go ahead and do that." I think these are all
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.160]   valid investments. Back to my framework, optimize lifestyle. You want to optimize the way that you
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.960]   invest. I think many people make a mistake by jumping straight to mutual funds or straight to
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.440]   index funds or anything like that without first considering, "Do I want to start a surfing
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.480]   company? Do I want to start this insert option here?" That's how I'd approach it. I do think
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.000]   from there, I can't get any more specific without knowing more specific scenarios, but you should
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.920]   definitely consider for a traveler. You should definitely consider expatriating from the United
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.240]   States. You should definitely consider renouncing citizenship. There are some really compelling,
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.320]   depending on how your income is earned, if you can escape the clutches of the US government,
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   that can be really, really powerful. There are some great ways to do it. The perpetual travel
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.720]   market has done a great job on this with the five flags theory, things like that. You can move to
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.800]   another country, gain citizenship in another country, renounce US citizenship. That may save
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.360]   you a tremendous amount of income taxes. You should also pay attention and thoroughly understand the
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.720]   foreign earned income exclusions and how that works. You should look seriously at the technical
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   details of that, but that's beyond what I can just jump into off the cuff like this.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:43.200]   Totally understood. I appreciate the setup for that because folks who are listening,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.880]   we do have an expert in sovereignty, permanent traveling, and flag theory coming onto the
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.920]   podcast in a couple of weeks. This is a great introduction to that of like, "Wait, wait, what?
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:46:00.800]   Renouncing? What? How do I do this?" There is so much to learn there about how you can actually
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.480]   save more of your money by not letting the US government have it. Just by doing that alone,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:13.840]   you'd "decrease your expense" by not impacting your income at all, but just spending less. That's
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:19.680]   going out the door. There's fun hacks around doing that. So stay tuned for more information on that.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:25.600]   Joshua, we've just been blown away by all of this information. Obviously, we can go find you
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:32.000]   at Radical Personal Finance on all the social channels and iTunes and dot com. But what are
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.440]   some things you want to leave us with? What's one thing either that we didn't cover or a major tip
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:43.120]   that would be really beneficial for our audience? We have two practical tips. One is related to the
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.200]   question of perpetual travel, but it's expandable beyond that. The very first action step that if a
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.960]   listener is listening and they say, "I want to achieve something I'm not achieving. What do I
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:58.320]   do?" The very first action step you should do is you should start to build for yourself first a
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.560]   balance sheet, a statement of financial position, what are my assets, what are my expenses,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.400]   to show in the archives of Radical Personal Finance if you'd like details on that. Also,
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.480]   a cash flow statement. The most important thing with a cash flow statement is that it should be
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   comprehensive of all of your expenses. What I mean is most people are aware that they should
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   somehow set up a budget. But what they mean by that is, "I should take my income and figure
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.680]   out how to expend it." When I say a cash flow statement, you should have all of your income,
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.440]   the gross income before anything is deducted. Then you should itemize what every one of your
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:35.600]   expenses is, including things like employment taxes, including things like income taxes,
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:40.080]   including things like health insurance, including things like real estate taxes,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:46.160]   including things like any expense that you have. Because you need to know those things so that you
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.400]   can evaluate different courses of action. My understanding is you're down in Mexico right now.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:55.440]   So if I'm looking at the options and saying, "Well, maybe I should move to Mexico, maybe I
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.960]   shouldn't." If I look and say, "Well, I need to spend $3,000 a month here in the United States,
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.040]   how am I going to do that in Mexico?" If I miss the fact that I can adjust my health insurance,
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.760]   if I miss the fact that I can adjust my income taxes, if I miss that, I might not be able to
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:15.360]   figure out how to actually get there. But if I recognize that by moving from West Palm Beach,
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:20.080]   Florida to Mexico, I'm going to be able to save here, here, here, here, but this expense over
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.720]   here is going to go up, up, then I can figure out the budget. So get actual data. And that's
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.320]   one of the things, if you are earning $40,000 a year, there's no reason for you to go and renounce
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.400]   your citizenship and go be a perpetual traveler. You're not going to save enough, in my opinion.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.200]   You're not going to save enough in that situation to make a big difference. If you're making $400,000
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.360]   a year, or if you're going to build significant assets in the future, now all of a sudden,
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.480]   you need to seriously consider it and you want to do it in advance. But you only know that if you
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:54.000]   actually have the data. So you need to have data. That's tip number one. Tip number two is once you
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.440]   have that data, look at your expenses and ask yourself a question. I think it's okay to start
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.880]   with little expenses like, "Hey, what am I spending on coffee?" Fine, but most people are not spending
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.520]   a latte every day. Most people are not spending that much money on coffee. I think it's great to
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.080]   look at the big expenses first and to say, "How could I cut... What's the biggest line item in my
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.560]   budget?" For many people, it'll be tax. For many people, it'll be housing. For many people, it'll
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.840]   be transportation. Those big three are simple. I would say, "How can I look at this line item and
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.680]   how can I cut this by 50% and get a better standard of living?" Not just how can I get it a
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.240]   little bit cheaper. Think in big numbers. Sometimes when you have a compelling goal, all of a sudden,
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.000]   you realize, "Well, I'm going to move out of this house and my goal is to go and buy an RV and
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.320]   travel the world, but as an interim step, what I can do is I can move out of this house. We can
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.760]   move into a smaller apartment. I can cut my monthly expenses by 50% and we can have a better lifestyle.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.960]   That'll free me up to work more so we can save more money." The most accessible way for most
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:59.120]   people to fund a goal like travel is going to be to save. You can save aggressively for a period
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:05.120]   of time. When you save, that'll allow you to have money behind you. It'll allow you to cut your
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.880]   expenses and it'll open up many more opportunities for you to figure out how to earn income on the
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.680]   road and stretch the amount of time that you can spend on the road. Look at your big expenses and
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:21.760]   start with your big expenses. Fix your housing, fix your transportation, fix your taxes, fix your
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.560]   food. If you fix those things, some people need to fix your insurance. If you fix those four or
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.840]   five things, that'll all of a sudden free up thousands of dollars a month and you can reallocate
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.360]   that money in a direction that's more suited with your long-term goals. Love it. Man, I wish I had
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:43.280]   talked to you three years ago when we started planning all of this. Really appreciate you being
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.760]   here today and we will have lots of links shared in today's show notes. Joshua, just thanks for
