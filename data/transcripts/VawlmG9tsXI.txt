[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Now, should everyone wear a face mask? That's one of the big questions people all over the
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.440]   world are asking at the minute. This week, Singapore made wearing masks compulsory in
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.100]   public and in the state of New York. They are also required whenever social distancing
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.180]   is not possible. But many countries are still advising people not to use them unless they
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.180]   are sick.
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.960]   Well, to help us understand the science behind this, I'm joined by Jeremy Howard, a scientist
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.200]   at the University of San Francisco and co-founder of the FAST.AI Research Institute. Jeremy,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.960]   thanks for joining us. You've reviewed the research around face masks. What are the main
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   things that you found?
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.520]   Yes, I'm the lead author on the latest study here, which is a cross-disciplinary international
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.560]   review of the evidence around face masks from 19 of the top world experts in this area.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.500]   And what we found is that the evidence is surprisingly clear. When we speak, we can
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.220]   transmit this disease by little droplets that come out of our mouth so small that we can't
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.280]   see them. And any kind of simple cloth mask or paper towel mask actually stops them in
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.340]   their tracks, about 99 percent effective at stopping them.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.600]   We looked at the data around this and we saw that there's actually countries that have
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.520]   already figured out how to keep their economy going without mass destruction like we're
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.440]   seeing in London and New York, mass death. For example, Taiwan and Hong Kong, their economies
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.840]   largely continuing as usual with just a few social distancing measures, but not a lockdown.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.640]   And they only have 10 deaths each, despite Taiwan, for example, having a population of
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.240]   30 million. They're doing the testing, the tracing, the quarantine of potentially infected
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.480]   and face masks. There's a magic four-piece solution, which we're already seeing working
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.400]   and face masks are part of it.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.480]   Yeah, it's really interesting you mentioned Taiwan and Hong Kong there. Why is there this
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.600]   divide between Asia and the West over this? Because countries that you mentioned, Japan,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.960]   China, Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, masks have been the norm for quite a few years now.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.000]   Well, there's been an important change in East Asia. Masks have been the norm for people
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.800]   with symptoms. And unfortunately, that doesn't really help in this case because we now know
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.280]   that about half of the infections come from people that don't have symptoms at the time
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.920]   that the infection happens. So what happened is in Taiwan and Hong Kong, they were pretty
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.460]   close to the epicenter of this pandemic. They had people on the ground in Wuhan. They saw
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.080]   the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread. And so they very quickly realized, OK, everybody
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.640]   needs to wear a mask. They already had the mask wearing culture because they have, unfortunately,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.600]   a history of respiratory pandemics in that region. So they know about the importance
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.680]   of masks. And with this vital new scientific fact, which is you can transmit the disease,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.840]   even if you don't know who you have it, very quickly, everybody realized we need everybody
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.120]   wearing masks. Otherwise, people are at risk. And briefly, Jeremy, your advice then to anyone
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.720]   in a city with a significant coronavirus outbreak as well as social distancing would be simply
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.840]   to wear a mask. Yes. And really any mask, you can literally take a piece of paper towel,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.480]   you can staple the rubber band onto each end and you can stick it over your face. And that
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.200]   is incredibly effective at stopping the droplets. It won't necessarily keep you safe from those
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.340]   around you, but it will keep those around you safe from you. So if you make sure that
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.360]   everywhere you go, everybody's wearing a mask, that's going to do a great job of keeping
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.560]   you safe. So we really need help here from governments, from unions. And so London today,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.840]   the London mayor is saying we want to enforce masks throughout our city. And this is why.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.960]   Jeremy Howard, really interesting to talk to you about that. That's Jeremy Howard live
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.840]   there from Houston in Texas. Thanks so much.
