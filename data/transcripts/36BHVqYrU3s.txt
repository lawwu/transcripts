[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Do unbelievers get a second chance at salvation after death?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   This is a common question in the inbox. It's an important question, too.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   So important that two people asked the same question at the same time,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   inspired by the same biblical text.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   "Hello, Pastor John. My name is Florin. I am a Romanian, but live in London.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   I have asked a few different pastors, but they could not give me an answer.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Can you explain 1 Peter 3, verses 19-20 and 1 Peter 4-6,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   this idea that the gospel was preached to the dead?"
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And the question also recently came from a listener named Jason.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   "Pastor John, could you please explain 1 Peter 3, 19 to me?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I've heard so many explanations to what Jesus was doing and why he was there.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Some go so far as to imply a second chance salvation.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Is there one?"
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I've returned to this text, and I'm thinking particularly now of 3.19.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I've returned to this text over and over in the last 50 years
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and have to admit that I don't have complete confidence
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   that I know for sure what Peter is referring to when he says that Christ,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   in the Spirit, preached to those who are now in prison.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Here's what the verse says, so everybody can be up to speed with us.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   "Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   but made alive in the Spirit."
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And here it comes.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   "In which," that is, in that Spirit,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   "he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   because they formerly did not obey when God's patience waited
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   in which a few," that is, eight persons, "came safely through the water.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Baptism," which corresponds to this, "now saves you,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   not as a removal of dirt from the body,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   but as an appeal to God for a good conscience
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   with angels' authorities and powers, having been subjected to him."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And I read the whole thing because the context is going to make a difference
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   in the various interpretations that are put forward.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So here's what Martin Luther said about this text.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   "A wonderful text is this, and a more obscure passage perhaps
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   than any other in the New Testament,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   so that I do not know for a certainty just what Peter means."
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That's Martin Luther.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's pretty much the way I feel as well.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   "I do not know for a certainty."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So I'm going to mention the three main interpretations
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and then tell you the one I lean toward and why,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   and then step back and say a word about handling texts
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   where you're not sure all that it means.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So here's the first one.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   One interpretation is that between Good Friday and Easter, those days,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Christ in the Spirit, in his Spirit, went to the place of the dead and preached.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   This is linked then to Ephesians 4.8, where it says that when he ascended,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   he led a host of captives.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So he led Old Testament saints out of the temporary place of the dead
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   with him into heaven.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now this may well be the right interpretation,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   but it does seem odd to me that the focus of Jesus' preaching
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   would seem to be limited to those who did not obey in the days of Noah.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   If the reference is to all the Old Testament saints
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   and the fact that they disobeyed is an odd way of referring to them as well,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   then I'm just still puzzled.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So that may be right.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I've got good friends who hold that view.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's a pretty traditional view.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Here's the second one.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Another interpretation argues that the preaching of Jesus after the crucifixion
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   refers to his ascended proclamation of victory over those angelic forces
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   referred to in verse 22 that I read at the end of the passage,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So this view says that the spirits in prison are the evil angels in prison
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   for their disobedience, and Jesus is simply announcing after the resurrection
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   his victory over them.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And again, that may be right.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I've got a good friend who wrote a commentary who thinks that's the right interpretation.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But I have a hard time following Peter's thought from the days of Noah
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   to that conclusion.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So here's the third one, and it's the one I have leaned to.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I've circled back to it again and again.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   The view that I keep coming back to is it seems attractive to me
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   because the strangeness of this text has already been set up for us
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   by the strangeness of another text back in chapter 1.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Here's what 1 Peter 1, 10, and 11 says.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   "Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   was indicating."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   That's amazing that he's talking about the Spirit of Christ in the prophets,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   like Noah perhaps, in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   and the subsequent glories.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So Peter has already prepared us for thinking that Christ in his Spirit
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   during the Old Testament went and preached through the prophets.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So 1 Peter 3, 19 can very legitimately be translated that Jesus,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "in the Spirit, having gone to the spirits who are now in prison,"
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   they're now in prison, "proclaimed to them in the days of Noah."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So on this interpretation, there's no preaching to the dead
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   between Good Friday and Easter, whether that happened or not.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I'm saying that's not what this text is about.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Instead, there's a reference to the fact that the very Spirit that raised Jesus
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   from the dead was the Spirit in which he had gone and preached through Noah
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   to the world of Noah's day.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Most were disobedient.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Most people were disobedient, and they're now in prison,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   awaiting their final judgment.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Now, it seems to me that this interpretation has the advantage
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   of making good sense out of why there is a focus on Noah
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   and the people of his day.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Why did Noah even come to Peter's mind to think of Noah at this point
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   in the argument?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   What brought him to mind as he was writing this text?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Now, I said that I would try to explain how I think about handling text
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   where I'm not clear on some things.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Well, in this case, what I do is to step back and look at the larger flow
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   of Peter's thought and ask, "What's he trying to do in verses 18 to 22?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Why did the issue of Noah and the disobedience of so many people
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and the salvation of so few in the ark, namely eight,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   why did that even come to his mind?"
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And I think the answer is that the churches that Peter was writing to
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   were very small and insignificant in comparison to this gigantic
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Roman Empire.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Most of that empire were being disobedient to the gospel in Peter's day.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   The salvation of such a few people in this huge Roman Empire caused Peter
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   to think of the days of Noah when only eight people came safely
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   through the waters of judgment.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And Peter says over in chapter 4 that in his day it's time for judgment
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   to begin with the household of God, similar to the days of judgment
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   in Noah's day.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And as he ponders this parallel between the salvation of a few in Noah's day
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   and the salvation of a few through baptism in his own day,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   it strikes him perhaps as he thinks back on chapter 1, verses 10 and 11,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   where Christ was preaching through the prophets in the Old Testament,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   it strikes him that it might be helpful to mention that the analogy
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   between Noah's day and his own day is even fuller and deeper
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   than the people might think.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   In other words, the analogy is not just that vast numbers
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   of people were unbelieving and disobedient in Noah's day,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   just like they are in Peter's day, and only a few were saved
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   through the ark, just like only a few were being saved
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   through the waters of baptism.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   But also the analogy extends to the fact that Jesus himself,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   by the Spirit, through Noah, was preaching in the days of Noah,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and Jesus is preaching by the Spirit through the apostles
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   in Peter's day.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So, even if I'm wrong about my understanding of the details
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   of Christ preaching through Noah to the world of his day,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I think this bigger picture is right.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   That's what I meant when I said trying to understand,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   "What do you do with the text if you don't understand all the details?"
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You try to get, "What's the bigger picture that you can see clearly?"
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I think it's right and has a huge significance for that day
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and for ours.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Noah came to Peter's mind because only a few were saved
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   in the ark under God's judgment, and now salvation through faith,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   through baptism, is like that.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Through water, God saves his people, whether few or many,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   at any given time and place, and we should rejoice
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   that Christ died to bring us to God through his judgment.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   The whole world may laugh, as in the days of Noah,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   but by faith we do.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   We come safely through the judgment.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Great point about letting the flow of context help decipher
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   the meaning of confusing text.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   That's really helpful.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Speaking of hard texts in Peter, why does Peter say that we are
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   saved through baptism?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That's his claim in 1 Peter 3.21.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Why does he say it?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   What does he mean by that?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   We will be back here on Wednesday to look at that text,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   1 Peter 3.21.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   [end]
