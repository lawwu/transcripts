[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460]   Is it possible for somebody to have a lot of muscle, but their muscle health is poor?
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.860]   Yes.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.700]   Okay.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.140]   Conversely, can somebody have a moderate to low amount of muscle, but their muscle quality
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.640]   is high, or is that less common?
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.240]   Well, the first thing that you said is absolutely something that we see, is that in an individual
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.960]   that carries a lot of muscle and say they're inactive, there is a big discussion about
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   how heavy individuals will have more muscle mass.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.760]   But what we have to recognize is the health of that skeletal muscle is fat deposition can
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.180]   be visceral fat deposition, fat around the organs, and it can be also fat infiltrate into the
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.300]   tissue, like, not to gross anyone out, a marbled steak.
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.100]   And that's exactly what can happen to unhealthy skeletal muscle, which then affects its ability
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.680]   to contract, which also affects, there's a ton of mitochondria in skeletal muscle, it affects
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.720]   the efficiency of skeletal muscle.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.380]   So yes, someone can have potentially more muscle, but more unhealthy muscle.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.240]   Interesting.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.540]   When you say a marbled steak, I think at the extreme, a wagyu, a raw wagyu looks like there's
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.840]   as much white fat in it as there is red meat in it.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.420]   And it's a very different taste and texture.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.640]   So that's what we're talking about.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.020]   My understanding is those cows don't move around much.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.400]   They're somewhat sedentary compared to, say, a free-range grass-eating cow.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.840]   Is that right?
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.440]   Okay.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.620]   That's absolutely correct.
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.960]   Okay.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.540]   So we want quality, healthy muscle, and then we can talk about muscle amount.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.960]   And then the other thing that I'll say about it is part of what defines muscle health is
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.220]   that flux, that movement.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.900]   So if you were to think about skeletal muscle like a suitcase, and an individual was, say,
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.940]   going on a trip for four days, but chooses to eat or pack for 30 days.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.180]   We know these people.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.680]   Yes, I know I'm maybe one of them.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.820]   I have my suitcase here.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.980]   I was only coming in for a day, but I may have packed for four days.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.120]   Not sure what I was doing, but that's besides the point.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.280]   When an individual is overeating calories, overeating carbohydrates, I had mentioned earlier
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.680]   that skeletal muscle, one of its primary roles is glucose disposal.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.920]   And I'm sure we're going to get in the mechanisms of glucose disposal, whether it's
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.540]   insulin-dependent or insulin-independent, depending on if someone is moving or contracting
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.080]   that muscle.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.400]   When an individual is eating food, carbohydrates, it gets stored in skeletal muscle as glycogen
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.180]   because, as we know, glucose at a high level is toxic to the body.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.140]   So the body must move glucose out of the bloodstream into the cells.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.320]   Now, what happens is there becomes this stasis.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.300]   So if an individual is inactive and not exercising, then that skeletal muscle becomes
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.020]   overpacked.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.020]   Skeletal muscle at rest burns primarily free fatty acids, which is interesting.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.860]   Most people think about skeletal muscle as burning carbohydrates, but actually at rest, skeletal
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.100]   muscle burns fatty acids.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.600]   As you can imagine, when that muscle is full and you are not exercising it, then the substrates
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   have nowhere to go.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.660]   And it remains in the bloodstream.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.620]   And that would be a sign of unhealthy skeletal muscle, which then loops back to what you see
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.160]   in blood work.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.540]   Elevated insulin, elevated blood glucose.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.660]   Yes.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.440]   Elevated free fatty acids, elevated branched chain amino acids, all of these things, which
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.520]   again, as skeletal muscle, as the metabolic sink, have nowhere to go.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.360]   So I'm starting to get a picture where in order to have healthy muscle, we need to think about
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.520]   the feeding of that muscle, the providing of nutrients to that muscle, that is, as well
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.800]   as the use of that muscle.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.340]   Let's start with the feeding or the providing of nutrients to that muscle.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.020]   You mentioned that muscle at rest mainly burns fatty acids.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.680]   It can store glycogen.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.760]   How do we know when a muscle is full of glycogen?
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.040]   I mean, there's the visual representation of the muscle seems fuller as opposed to flatter,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.640]   you know, but these are not specific or these are not precise terms.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.040]   You know, how much carbohydrate does it take to fill all the muscle of the body with glycogen?
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.560]   And then what sorts of things perhaps deplete that?
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.060]   I think it's a great question.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.700]   We know that when we're talking about glycogen, the liver stores glycogen, maybe 100 grams.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.380]   And then skeletal muscle, depending on your size, for example, you might store much more
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.960]   muscle glycogen, whether it's for 500 grams compared to someone who is my size.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.040]   And can we do the standard conversion of four calories per gram?
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.400]   So if the liver is 400 grams, you know, we just say, okay, there's about 1600 calories worth
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.560]   of energy there.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.920]   So if I go out and I do some exercise and burn 1600 calories over time, does that mean
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.540]   that the liver is then completely depleted?
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.540]   So, well, the liver will deplete through an overnight fast.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.200]   So the liver maintains blood glucose.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.840]   So skeletal muscle doesn't maintain blood glucose directly.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.180]   The way that you would leverage muscle glycogen would be through exercise.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.000]   The way in which you would deplete muscle glycogen would be through more intensive exercise.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.060]   And when you think about the foods and the way in which, you know, your original question
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.060]   is how would we know how much muscle glycogen or how much we need to refuel, I typically think
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.800]   about it as overall activity levels.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.200]   So if someone is sedentary, then the current recommendation for carbohydrates would be 130
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.620]   grams.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.240]   Per day?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.720]   Per day.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.260]   At four calories per gram?
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.640]   At four calories per gram.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.180]   And is that both simple and complex carbohydrates, fibrous carbohydrates?
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.540]   Yes.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.100]   It would just be overall.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.040]   130 grams.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.220]   Yes.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.400]   If they're completely sedentary.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.740]   Yes.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.840]   So just a little bit of walking, getting up, going to the computer, to the bathroom, to the
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.600]   car, et cetera, but basically sedentary.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.840]   Yes.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.420]   And the average American takes in 300 grams of carbohydrates a day.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.100]   So more than double.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.680]   And as you can imagine, this can distort metabolism.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   When we think about glucose disposal, the way in which I think about glucose disposal, if an
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.620]   individual is sedentary, is thinking about how many carbohydrates an individual can ingest
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.680]   at one time that would mitigate insulin response and would be able to be disposed of safely.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.660]   And that number is between 40 and 50 grams of carbohydrates at a meal outside of exercise.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.540]   The rest of carbohydrates would be earned through exercise.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:46.020]   And through every hour of exercise, depending on the intensity, that could be between 40 to
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.140]   70 grams, depending on how intense an individual exercise is.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.580]   And that would be safely disposed of in a two-hour period.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.760]   I mean, when you think about an oral glucose tolerance test, that's a 75-gram load.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.400]   You assume within two hours that that blood sugar regulation should come back to a normal range.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:13.600]   So at 40 to 50 grams of carbohydrate every two hours, does that mean that if somebody were to eat
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.380]   40 to 50 grams of carbohydrates every two hours?
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.140]   Which they shouldn't.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   Which they shouldn't, right?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.960]   But because you're going to quickly exceed that 130 grams per day.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:29.720]   And even if exercising with resistance training, say, hard for an hour, which can afford somebody
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.620]   maybe, what, another couple hundred, 300 grams of carbohydrates?
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.620]   Probably not that much.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.060]   Okay.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.580]   You know, I think that if people care about body composition, which I would say everyone should,
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.800]   because you want to have an appropriate level of body fat and healthy skeletal muscle,
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.080]   then you wouldn't necessarily, unless you're doing some kind of cardiovascular activity,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.600]   you're not using a ton of muscle glycogen, depending on how much you're training.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.040]   And how much glycogen is the brain using?
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.420]   So that is a good question.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.480]   The brain uses a lot of carbohydrates.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.860]   That would be a primary source.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.060]   When they come up with the numbers of 130, it's really based on brain and then the rest of the body.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.960]   Can we safely say that for somebody that's thinking a lot, they need more carbohydrates?
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.100]   You could say that.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.980]   Then your brain, yes, your brain is very metabolically active.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.580]   Interesting.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.820]   So we're kind of drawing rough estimates, not knowing people's body weight,
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.060]   not knowing their body composition.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.460]   But what I'm arriving at here is, you know, if somebody does a little bit of cardiovascular training,
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.760]   maybe a little bit of light resistance training, I'm describing the activities of many people out there,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.620]   maybe 250 grams of carbohydrates, you're kind of at the threshold.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.200]   That's a lot.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.280]   That's a lot.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.640]   Four calories per gram of those carbohydrates.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.740]   So let's say 200 grams of carbohydrates per day.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.760]   But that's not a ton of calories overall.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.120]   So what should the remainder of the calories be made up of?
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.780]   So, you know, I think what we're really talking about here is how do we design a nutrition plan
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.120]   for people to have healthy skeletal muscle?
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.600]   Right.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.140]   And, you know, if I were to say, okay, what are we thinking about for the listener or for the people out there?
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:23.940]   They're thinking, you know, I really want to have a healthy body composition and healthy skeletal muscle mass.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.280]   The way in which they would do that is, number one, you have to prioritize dietary protein.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.700]   So we're talking about carbohydrates here, but carbohydrates shouldn't be the primary focus.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.680]   Nobody has challenges getting carbohydrates in.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.420]   130 grams would be a safe recommendation.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:45.460]   If someone is overweight or struggles with type 2 diabetes or any of these other metabolic conditions,
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.940]   there is evidence to support a lower carbohydrate intake.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:55.440]   I mean, 130 grams is, you know, one little micro packet of pretzels on an airplane ride.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.200]   You know?
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.260]   So that actually has probably closer to 37 grams of carbohydrates.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.840]   Okay, good.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.620]   Not that I had a pretzel packet before or threw one at Rob on the way in, but no.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.120]   Right.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.880]   Okay, so I'm way off there.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:16.480]   So they have one of those, a bagel in the morning, and they shouldn't, but they do.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.320]   And then they have some, you know, pasta at dinner.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.420]   And so most people are probably exceeding that 130 grams by a huge margin.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.340]   Yes, they are.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.720]   And there's a couple things there that it's really important that you said is that individuals,
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.360]   when we're thinking about designing a plan for skeletal muscle health, that first meal
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   is most important.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.820]   That first meal of the day, having dietary protein will set you up metabolically for the rest of
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.060]   the day.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.040]   And when you say first meal, and we'll talk a little bit later about intermittent fasting
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.860]   and, you know, I, for instance, eat my first meal at usually 11 a.m.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.900]   It's just kind of how I'm wired.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.580]   I've never wanted to eat breakfast first thing.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.940]   I've forced myself to eat some eggs first thing in the morning from time to time, and it
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.580]   felt fine.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.260]   But do you recommend that people eat a true breakfast, like within a certain number of
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.880]   hours of waking up for sake of muscle health and metabolic health?
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.460]   When we think about that first meal, I frankly don't care when you have it.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.880]   One also has to understand that you're coming out of an overnight fast.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.800]   If you are young and healthy, then the timing of that first meal likely doesn't matter because
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:33.660]   you are robust, your body is very efficient and capable to withstand protein degradation.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:39.460]   It's able to withstand protein degradation and protein turnover, which is ultimately why
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:39.980]   we're eating.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.260]   So that's one reason why we're eating.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.360]   And we'll talk a little bit more about that.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.640]   That first meal of the day, if you are young and healthy, the timing doesn't really matter.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.380]   And I would say when it begins to matter is when you're older.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:12:00.440]   When you are in your 60s, continuing to fast may be a negative, a negative for muscle health.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:07.640]   That first meal of the day is important because we know that when you get between 40 and 50 grams
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.520]   of protein, that first meal of the day, you stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.380]   Muscle protein synthesis is by proxy what we use to measure as a marker for overall muscle
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:18.720]   health.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.000]   Now, there's a lot of history here when we think about designing a meal plan.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.580]   That first meal has between, we'll say, give it between 30 to 50 grams of dietary protein.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.140]   That will do a number of things.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.320]   Number one, it will stimulate skeletal muscle, what we would consider the health of skeletal muscle.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.500]   It also will affect the brain.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.060]   It'll improve satiation.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.580]   You and I were talking previously.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.360]   It releases a handful of gut peptides.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.180]   Like glucagon-like peptide one, which later we'll talk about.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:59.040]   GLP, yes, GLP, CCK, PYY, things that will affect appetite for that second meal.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.800]   There's some very interesting research out of Heather Leidy's lab.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:10.560]   Basically, when she put individuals, younger adolescents, on a meal of 30 to 40 grams of
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:18.460]   protein, they were much less likely to choose, say, donuts or something outside of what we would
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.680]   consider a healthy nutrition plan.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.360]   Later in the day or in the same meal?
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.000]   Later in the day.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.120]   It was essentially augmenting their willpower.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.780]   Okay, so it sounds like for young people, they can delay breakfast if they want.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.140]   For older people, probably not.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.020]   But that the first meal of the day should include what you're calling dietary protein, 30 to 50
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.460]   grams.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:36.920]   Yes.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.280]   And maybe we should talk about the quality of that protein.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.520]   Because I think a lot of people understand that there are meat proteins, there are plant proteins.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.860]   How important is the quality of that protein?
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.780]   This tends to be a hot topic and somewhat very controversial.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.340]   Great.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.520]   Great for you.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:56.960]   I know.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.840]   Great for everybody.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.140]   I mean, controversy on this podcast is embraced in the following way.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.100]   We state what we know.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.280]   We state what we don't know.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:13.460]   And we are always happy to return to the conversation in a future time to adjust any stances based on
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.840]   the data and how we evolve as people.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.660]   Okay.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.740]   Well, I love that.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.780]   Dietary protein, we speak about it as if it's one thing.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.940]   But actually, it's 20 different amino acids, nine of which are essential.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.080]   The rest we can generate in our body.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.940]   And when we think about skeletal muscle, we think about the essential amino acids.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:39.160]   And the essential amino acids primarily for skeletal muscle health are the branch chain
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.820]   amino acids, leucine being one of those.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.880]   So leucine is uniquely stimulating to skeletal muscle.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.780]   And when you have enough leucine, it triggers muscle protein synthesis.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.960]   And when you say stimulating and muscle protein synthesis, I think a lot of people get a picture
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.280]   in their mind of a muscle growing.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.100]   But you're not necessarily talking about that.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:05.780]   You're talking about the organ that is muscle, that its health, its metabolism being cultivated
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.540]   so that it can do all the hormone endocrine related things and the glucose disposal related
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.300]   things that we'll get into in a bit more detail later.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:12.840]   Is that right?
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:20.000]   And so when you have a breakfast of 30 to 50 grams, you appropriately stimulate muscle
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.700]   protein synthesis.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:27.520]   And one has to recognize that if you eat below that threshold, you do not stimulate the health
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.380]   of that skeletal muscle.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:35.560]   You do not stimulate muscle in a way that would be necessary for outcomes that matter.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.980]   And outcomes that matter are sarcopenia.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.740]   Outcomes that matter are body composition, prevention of obesity.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.780]   You must get this nutrition right.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.060]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   It's the thing that 100% of people do is eat.
