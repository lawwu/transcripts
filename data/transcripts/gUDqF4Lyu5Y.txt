[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.960]   A man who is anonymous, but who listens to the podcast
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   and who does not give us his age, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.920]   Hello, Pastor John, blessings to you.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.800]   I have a faith question for you today.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.840]   My dad recently died of a brain tumor.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.660]   And man, we're sorry to hear about this.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.200]   I prayed with all the faith I could muster
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.780]   to ask God that he not die,
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.400]   but he did.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.640]   I wonder if I had more faith, would my dad be alive today?
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.220]   In the Bible, I always see Jesus healing people
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.680]   who had faith, even healing them because of their faith.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.280]   In Matthew 9.22, Matthew 15.28,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.280]   Jesus refused to heal people in his own hometown
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.500]   because of their unbelief, in Matthew 13.58.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.420]   And he even connects the probability of seeing miracles
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.120]   to the size of one's own personal faith in Matthew 17.20.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.120]   So could my lack of faith be a factor in my dad's death
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.880]   or was it simply the will of God for him to die?
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.580]   I'm sure this is a question for many people who like me
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.480]   get attacked often by guilt.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.600]   I'm gonna take my cue from that last sentence.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   I'm sure this is a question for many people
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   who like me get attacked often by guilt.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.960]   So our friend is saying he is often attacked by guilt.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.340]   In this case, it's guilt for the death of his father
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.360]   because of the possibility, he raises,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   that if he had had more faith, his father may not have died.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.600]   And so he is attacked by guilt
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.040]   that he may not have had enough faith.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.460]   So where I wanna start is this.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.460]   Suppose I said, yes, your father would be alive today
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.720]   if you had had more faith.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.760]   And suppose I was right, just two big suppositions,
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.640]   just saying, try it out.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.760]   Suppose I was right and suppose you believed me,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.920]   what would you do?
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.120]   Now, I think the answer to that question
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.360]   is more important than the question
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.080]   whether your father would have died
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.560]   if you'd had more faith.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   Because my question has to do with your eternal standing
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.900]   in God and how you live in it.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.400]   But your question has to do only with the length of life
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.600]   on this earth of your dad
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.160]   and the relative quality of your faith.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.840]   So what would you do if I said, yes,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.800]   your father would be alive today if you'd had more faith?
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.880]   I hope you would say this.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.640]   I would get down on my knees
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.000]   and I would tell God how sorry I was
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.980]   for being so weak in faith.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.200]   And I would grieve over my lack of faith
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.240]   and I would grieve over the loss of my father.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.840]   And I would cry out to Jesus who loved me
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   and gave himself for me.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.640]   And I would tell him that I trust him
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   and I would receive from him afresh his forgiveness.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.480]   And I would ask him to heal my memories,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.160]   protect me from the destructive,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.680]   paralyzing accusations of guilt
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.840]   and the evil one that I feel so often
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.520]   and get tangled up in.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.000]   And I would resolve in a fresh way
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   to put my faith in the promises of God's daily help,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.160]   which I so need now to walk in as I move forward.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.640]   Now, if that's the way you would respond
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.680]   to my telling you that your father would be alive
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.400]   if you had more faith,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.040]   then you're in a very, very good position.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.720]   Whatever the answer is to your question.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.880]   In other words, the question about your faith
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.640]   in regard to your father's healing
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.040]   is not nearly as important as your faith
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.760]   in regard to your standing in the grace of Christ.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   This means that you can rest deeply and soundly in Christ.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.520]   Whatever else I have to say, and I'm gonna say more.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   So here we go.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   You ask, "If I had more faith, would my dad be alive today?"
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.080]   Here's my answer.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.520]   I don't know.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.200]   And the reason I can say that
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.520]   and still believe in the sovereign will of God
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.040]   working all things according to his infinite wisdom,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.960]   including life and death,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.280]   is that James said, "We have not because we ask not."
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.120]   James 4, 2.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.760]   "We have not because we ask not."
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.600]   In other words, when certain secondary causes,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.840]   praying in this case, asking,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.120]   when certain secondary causes are not in place,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.760]   then certain effects of those missing causes
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.600]   don't come about.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.560]   And since God rules over the causes as well as the effects,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.760]   this is not a contradiction of his sovereign rule.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.120]   Here's an analogy.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.800]   Would more people,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.680]   and I'm with you now in this kind of question.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.440]   So these are my questions, and they're like your question.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.600]   Would more people have been converted to Christ
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.880]   when I preached if I had prayed more in preparation?
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.880]   If I had preached with greater earnestness and tears?
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.560]   If I had prepared a better sermon
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.120]   and not given people so many distractions
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.840]   in the way I stumbled around?
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.240]   If I had looked people in the eye
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.160]   and communicated greater personal compassion?
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.800]   If I had put my sin of pride and self-consciousness
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.400]   to death more effectively?
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.600]   If I too had had more faith, more faith,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.960]   would more people have been converted?
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.080]   And my answer is, I don't know.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.160]   What I do know is that I would go insane
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.880]   if I had to figure out that every time I preached,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.080]   that when I preach, I've got to know what would have happened
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.600]   if I had done things differently.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   And when I preach, it's not just what's at stake earthly,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.800]   it's what's at stake eternal.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   Eternal lives are at stake when I preach,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.560]   not just my dad's few years of life on the planet.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.320]   I cannot bear the burden.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.520]   I can't bear it, having to answer the question,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.080]   what if, what if, what if, what if?
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.040]   So it is with our prayers for those we love,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.440]   whether physical healing or spiritual salvation.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.280]   Would more faith heal?
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.040]   Would more faith save?
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.400]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.080]   Jesus healed when there was no faith.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.480]   The widow's son at Nain and the man in John 9
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.800]   who didn't even know Jesus was after he was healed.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.640]   And he healed in response to little faith.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.760]   He healed in response to great faith.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.280]   He withheld healing for lack of faith.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.760]   And Paul called faith a gift.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.240]   And he said, you can have faith to remove mountains
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.800]   and not have love and amount to a big spiritual zero.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   So I think the way forward is to seek to grow in faith
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.680]   and to grow in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.840]   according to 2 Peter 3, 18.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.240]   Never, never, never be content
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.800]   with what you already possess in faith.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.600]   Always want more of all that God has to give,
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.160]   but realize that faith is a gift
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   and you can never presume that God owes it to you.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.360]   James teaches us to say,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.520]   if the Lord wills, we will live,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.600]   live and do this or that.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.840]   God decides who lives and who dies.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.680]   And he decides when.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.720]   And our main job is to trust his promise.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   And his promise is not to heal everyone we want healed.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.640]   His promise is to do good to those who trust him
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.520]   and to conform us to Christ
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.640]   and to give us the grace we need
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   to persevere in love and holiness to the end.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.880]   - Amen.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.760]   Those are precious, load-lifting promises to all of us.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.280]   because he makes Christianity look intelligent?
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.800]   Hmm, that's an interesting question.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.720]   It's one I did not see coming,
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.060]   but it's arrived and it's on the other side of the weekend.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
