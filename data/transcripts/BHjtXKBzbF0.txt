[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   Applied mathematicians. Okay, where do we put them in society where they can have the biggest benefit? That's such a good question in some ways
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.880]   I'm like the worst person to ask about that, but this isn't gonna answer your question
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.000]   But instead it's gonna like fan the flames of why I feel it's an important question
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.160]   I have actually been thinking recently about if it's worth making an out of typical video
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.040]   That's specifically addressed it like inspiring people to ask that especially students who are graduating because I think
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.680]   This thing happens where when you fall in love with math or some sort of technical field by default in school
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.260]   You you study that and when you're studying that
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.560]   Effectively, you're going through an apprenticeship to be an expert in that or a researcher in that
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.700]   You know the structure of studying physics in a university or math in a university
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.360]   Even though they know that not all majors are going to go into the field
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.840]   The people that you're gaining mentorship from our academics and our researchers in the field
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.520]   so it's hard not to effectively be apprenticing in that and I also have noticed that when I go and give talks at universities or
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.640]   things like this and
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.080]   Students come up after and they're like saying hi. There's a lot of them like grant
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.720]   The videos were really inspiring like you're the reason that I studied math or that you're the reason I'm like going into grad school
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.960]   And there's this little bell in the back of my mind. That's like cool. Cool. I'm amazed
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.240]   I don't know if I believe I was wholly responsible for it, but like cool to have that impact
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.960]   Do I want that?
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.240]   Is this a good thing to get more people going into math PhDs on the one hand?
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.600]   I unequivocally want more people to self-identify as liking math
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.440]   That's very good. But that those who are doing that necessarily get shuffled into the traditional outlets like math academia
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.160]   Yeah, I think you highlight it very right. It's like math academia finance and
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.400]   Computer science data science something in there in general
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.680]   Are very common things to go to and as a result, they almost certainly have an over allocation of talent
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960]   All three of those are valuable, right?
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.160]   I'm not saying like those are not valuable things to go into
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.640]   But if you were playing God and like shifting around where do you want people to go again? I'm not answering your question
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.160]   I'm just asking it in other words because I don't really know
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.680]   I think you should probably talk to the people who made that shift of which there aren't a huge number
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.820]   But like Eric Lander is maybe one good example
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.360]   Jim Simons would maybe be another
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.480]   Whereas people who were doing a very purely academic thing and then decided to shift to something very different
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.040]   now I have sort of had this thought that it's very beneficial to
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.760]   Insert some forcing function that gets the pure mathematicians to spend some of their time in a non pure math setting, you know
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.400]   NSF grants coming with a
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.920]   Requirement that 10% of your time goes towards a collaboration with another department or something like that
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.020]   the thought being these are really good problem solvers and a
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.200]   specific category of problems and to just distribute that talent elsewhere might be helpful and when I when I like run this by
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.280]   Mathematicians, sometimes there's a mixed response where they're like, ah, I don't know if we'd be all that useful
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.320]   Like there's a sense that the aesthetic of what constitutes a good math problem is by its nature
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.000]   Rooted in the purity of it such that it's maybe a little
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.080]   elitist to assume that just because people are really really good at solving that kind of problem that somehow their
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.440]   Abilities are more generalizable than other people's abilities
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.160]   you know why ask about the applied mathematicians rather than saying like shouldn't the applied biologists go and work in
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.400]   Logistics and things like that because they also have a set of problem-solving abilities. That's maybe generalizable the back of my mind
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   I think no, but the mathematicians are
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.600]   Really is something general math
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.560]   so I
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   Don't have the answers
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   I will say I'm actually very curious to hear from people for what they think the right answers are or from people who made that
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.720]   Switch, let's say they were a math major or something adjacent like computer science physics
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.800]   and then they decided that they wanted to pour themselves into something not because
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.280]   That was the academic itch that scratched that they were scratching by being good at school and getting to appreciate that
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.320]   But because they stepped back and said what impact do I want to make on the world?
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.840]   I'm hungry for more of those stories because I think it could be very compelling to
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.160]   Convey those specifically to my audience who is probably on
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.840]   Track to go into just the traditional math type fields and maybe there's room to have a little bit of influence to disperse them more
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400]   Effectively, but I don't know. I don't know what more effectively looks like because at the end of the day
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.600]   I'm like I'm a math youtuber, right? I'm not someone who
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.280]   has a career in logistics or manufacturing or all of these things in such a way that I can have an in-tune feel for
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.360]   Where is there a?
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.440]   Need for this specific kind of abstract problem-solving. It might be useful to
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.280]   speculate on how an
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.520]   Undergrad or somebody who's a young math whiz might even begin to contemplate. Here's where I can have an edge
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.000]   I'm remembering actually it just occurred to me a former podcast guest Lars Doucette
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   he was a game designer actually and
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.920]   he
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.040]   Started learning about Georgism, which is this idea that you should tax land and only land
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.000]   And so he got really interested in not only writing about those ideas
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.160]   But also with well if you're gonna tax land you had to figure out what the value of land is
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.520]   I mean, how do you figure out the value of land?
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.400]   there's all these algorithms of how you do this optimally based on neighboring land and how to average across land and
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.560]   There's a lot of intricacies there
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.360]   And so he he now has a startup where he just contracts with cities
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.080]   To implement these algorithms to help them assess the value of their land, which makes property taxes much more feasible
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.840]   You know just that's another example, right where the motivation was more philosophical
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.400]   But his specialty as a technical person helped him, you know helped to make a contribution there
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.560]   I think that's perfect
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.800]   Probably the true answer is that you're not gonna give a universal thing for any individual
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.880]   It's gonna be based on where their life circumstances connect them into something either because they he had an interest in Georgism for whatever reason
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.000]   but if someone I don't know their
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.120]   Their dad runs a paper mill and they're like connected to the family business in that way and realize they can like plug themselves in
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.040]   A little bit more efficiently you you're gonna have this wide diversity of the ways that people are applying themselves
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.880]   That does not take the form of general advice given from some podcast somewhere
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.560]   but instead takes the form of simply inviting people to like think critically about the question rather than following the momentum of
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   What being good at school implies about your future?
