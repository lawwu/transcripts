[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Today, I'm going to share with you a one-year update of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.220]   I'm going to share with you some changes to the format of the show and the content
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.240]   coming up in future days.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.160]   And then also, I just want to say thank you.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.920]   We've officially hit 200 patrons and $2,000 per month of patron support.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:41.200]   I'm going to talk about that and simply say thank you.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.520]   My name is Josh Weschetz, and I'm your host.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.560]   I'm your host.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.000]   I'm your guide to financial independence.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.640]   I'm your financial planner.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.720]   I'm your teacher.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.320]   And I'm your fellow journeyer on the pathway of financial independence here with you just
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320]   about every day.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.700]   We're going to talk about that today.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.840]   But journeying with you and guiding you to financial freedom and financial independence
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.720]   each and every day.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.180]   Today I'm going to share with you a little bit of behind-the-scenes stuff on the show,
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.360]   some things that I want you to be aware of, especially some changes to the content and
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.240]   the programming and the schedule of Radical Personal Finance coming up in the future.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.880]   I'm not going to be teaching you anything about personal finance today.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.680]   So if you would like to skip it because of that, feel free to skip.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.280]   But I do ask that you give a shot because as soon as I talk for just a moment about
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.600]   Patreon, then I'm going to talk about the changing format of Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   going forward.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.520]   So I'll try to keep this straight and to the point.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   But let's start with Patreon.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.440]   I just want to thank you, each and every one of you who have signed up for – with a Patreon
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.020]   account and supported the show as a patron of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.440]   There are a total of 201 of you.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   Actually, it's 200.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.300]   Two hundred of you.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.080]   I have a fake Patreon account that I use to keep an eye and make sure the content is going
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   out.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   So I'm one of my own patrons.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   I guess that's good.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   You got to believe in yourself.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.600]   So I patronize myself on Patreon.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   So you should too.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.440]   There are 200 of you who have taken the step to go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.720]   and sign up to support the show.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.640]   And we officially hit the first milestone goal that I really wanted to work towards.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.540]   And that first milestone goal is $2,000 per month.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.400]   And now that we've hit $2,000 per month, I'm going to be swapping out the new intro
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.140]   – swapping out the intro to the show and trying to work out a new introduction.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.920]   Now I may or may not switch the music.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.360]   When I said that I was going to be switching the music, I did that because I got a rash
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.000]   of emails and comments saying, "Josh, Radical Personal Finance has the worst intro in the
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   world."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.320]   But when I said on the show that I was going to be changing it, I got all kinds of more
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.440]   emails saying, "I love it.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   It gets me piped up.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   It gets me in the mood.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440]   I get ready."
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   And for me personally, it's kind of funny.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.640]   It's almost a Pavlovian response where when I hear the music, I go into character and
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.840]   I'm ready to go and it gets my energy up a little bit and reminds me to be peppy.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.040]   I like upbeat Latin music.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.280]   I will often – if I'm going to listen to music, one of the choices I'll go to
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.080]   sometimes is Latin music.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.840]   I'll listen to salsa or merengue or bachata, things like that.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.720]   So I like that being the intro to the show.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   But I may update it.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.480]   I may kind of swap it out a little bit.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   We'll see.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.160]   I'm going to figure that out and try to serve you guys in the best.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.520]   So that will give me the opportunity to keep going.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.680]   The biggest impact though that you have made on me is not reaching this first milestone
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.080]   of being able to swap out the music, although it's key.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.800]   At the end of this – I'm in the process of finishing out a contract that I've been
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.400]   working on, which has been how I paid my bills for the last year while building this show.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.080]   If it weren't for this Patreon account here, I mean every dollar of it is incredibly valuable.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.720]   It's not quite enough for me to live on, so I've got to build some other sources
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.880]   of income while I'm going.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.640]   But if it weren't for Patreon here, then I wouldn't be taking the track that I'm
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   taking, which is to keep on focusing 100% full time on the show.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.080]   Patreon is what has showed me that at least 200 of you believe in what I'm doing here
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.280]   and believe in the content and have benefited from it.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.120]   I mean just think for a moment about how incredible you are, that there's something that's
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.280]   available for free.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.520]   No one is charging you for it.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   You can listen to it.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.160]   You can do anything you want with it.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.960]   And yet you've taken the step to go out voluntarily and say, "I appreciate the
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   content.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.200]   I'm going to reward the content creator."
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.120]   I want to thank you for that.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.520]   It's been quite a journey and an incredible path.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.960]   It's what gives me the confidence to know that I'm on the right track and I'm going
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.520]   to continue going forward and continue building Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.760]   We've, like I said, hit a year here.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.120]   I launched the show full time on July 1, 2014.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.320]   As I record this, it's actually July 22, 2015.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.640]   So it's not quite a year, but I was a little busy around July 21.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.840]   I had a brand new little baby and she's still a brand new little baby, still settling
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.880]   into life.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.240]   I wasn't really actually ready on July 1 to tell you some of the changes that were
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   coming.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.360]   Now they're clearer in my head and I know what's coming in the future.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.480]   So the last year of the show has been awesome.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   It's been a lot of work.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.520]   I've released – today is episode 223, so I've released 213 episodes of Radical
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.560]   Personal Finance over the last year.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   Some have been good.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   Some have been bad.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.000]   A lot of them have been mediocre.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.320]   That's kind of the normal scenario.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.480]   But I've learned a lot all the way through.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.720]   I feel that as I've reflected back a lot on the past year and kind of figuring out
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.240]   what am I going to do, how am I going to build a Radical Personal Finance business, what
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.800]   are the different areas where I'm strong in, what am I weak in, it's brought me to
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.920]   the point of realizing that I need to make some changes to the format of the show and
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.360]   the content of the show.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.520]   And I've gone back and done a bit of analysis over which shows seem to resonate with most
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.400]   people and which shows I got the most feedback on, which were the ideas that really seemed
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   to resonate.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.360]   And it's brought me to the place of realizing what I need to do better going forward in
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.160]   the future.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.800]   And as I've listened to the content and looked through and just kind of considered
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.640]   the content I've released over the past weeks, one of the things that really has troubled
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.560]   me is I've felt like some of the content that I've created has been a little bit
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.040]   me too.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   It hasn't really stood out.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.200]   It hasn't been super radical.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.040]   It hasn't been necessarily playing to my core competencies.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.860]   It's just basically been a little bit me too, me kind of just doing similar things
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.240]   to what many other people are doing.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.960]   And for me to fulfill what I believe the unique selling proposition of Radical Personal Finance
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   is, I need to change that.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.240]   And so one of the things that's going to change about that is that the frequency of
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.600]   the show is going to slightly change.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.960]   From the beginning of the last year, I've had the goal of essentially releasing a podcast
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.540]   episode just about every day.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.920]   And at the beginning, I was going on a very strict Monday through Friday format of that
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   and that really helped me to build the skills.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.160]   And I released a show in the past called Why I Podcast Every Day and why you should emulate
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.920]   me and model me on doing what I'm doing.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.560]   But at this point, I believe that the usefulness of my being so focused on creating so much
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.320]   content and releasing it on a regular schedule has reached its peak.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.760]   And I say that for a few reasons.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.440]   Number one, because of the pressure of releasing shows consistently and it hasn't happened
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.040]   in the last few weeks with the birth of Baby Girl and June was pretty spotty.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.400]   But because of that pressure, what's happened is that the actual quality of the content
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.680]   has suffered.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.600]   So I've released show topics that were kind of ho-hum or I've released an interview that
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.560]   was a me-too interview and I just did it because it was convenient and because I didn't have
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:07.520]   the time to sit down and pour myself into the outlines that I need for a large show.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   The most difficult shows for me to create for you, just so that you know, the most difficult
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.360]   time-consuming shows are number one, the technical financial planning shows because there I need
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.800]   to take information, look back through and figure out what have I done in the past and
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.440]   what is a good way of keeping this at a deep enough level to be useful but to be able to
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.700]   articulate some of these concepts for you.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.700]   So those take a long time.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.440]   And then also the Q&A shows take a long time.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.000]   Well, what's interesting is the technical financial planning shows are the least popular
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.040]   of Radical Personal Finance episodes and the Friday Q&A shows are the most popular.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.560]   I'm not willing to give up the technical financial planning because I believe that really builds
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.640]   into the, again, the unique selling proposition of this show.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.480]   That's one of the things that I can do very effectively that many other people can't do.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.760]   There are many people with a cursory knowledge of finance that can do an interview with somebody
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.600]   on the basics of personal finance.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.680]   There are fewer people who can do a deep dive discussion of a technical financial planning
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.840]   topic.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.400]   And so that content is still underrepresented in the marketplace.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.960]   The Q&A is also important because the technical content actually drives the Q&A and oftentimes
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.600]   the questions that I get that are the most interesting that wind up being the most popular
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.620]   and the most listened to are questions that came out of your listening to the technical
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.980]   content of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:37.440]   So although I've said several times that I am not committed to the five-day-per-week
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.280]   format, I have said to myself, I've realized just in my own mind I still was working towards
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.000]   that as an ideal goal.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.560]   At this point in time I need to change that.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:55.960]   The reason is if you look at the survey, the marketplace of finance information and finance
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.280]   podcasts, there's more content out there than ever before.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:09.880]   When I originally tested the show in July of 2013, there were only a few personal finance
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   podcasts.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.840]   From 2013 to 2014 there were many more added.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:22.620]   And from 2014 to 2015 there have been many, many more and much, much more content.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.680]   So at this point the point of differentiation for Radical Personal Finance is not the frequency
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:35.840]   of the show, but rather my desire is that it's the unique nature of the content.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.080]   As I've listened to the feed over the past weeks, I've thought to myself, wait a second,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.400]   Josh was kind of straying a little bit from his core message.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.080]   And again, just the feeling I've had is this is a little bit me too.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.520]   And if it's me too, that's a problem.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.240]   So I've learned what I've needed to learn with the five day per week format.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.200]   I have gotten efficient as a broadcaster.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.800]   I've gotten better as a broadcaster.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.180]   I've built much more experience as a broadcaster.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:10.920]   And I believe I feel pretty good about where I have gotten to as far as the skills that
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   I have built.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.720]   I feel like I've become a much better interviewer.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.680]   I feel like I've become more coherent.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:25.280]   I feel like I've developed my ability to effectively articulate concepts and content without repeating
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.720]   myself ad nauseum.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.000]   So with that, I feel that I've gained what I need from the five day per week format.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.240]   At this point, the big gaping hole that I see out in the marketplace that still is needed
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   is deeper dive discussions, more technical content, and a deeper, more in-depth discussion
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.880]   of important topics that are not commonly talked about.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:57.480]   As an example, I've been wanting for months to do a series on things like the origin of
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.880]   the Federal Reserve System, to do a series on monetary discussions.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.880]   There's a big theme that runs around, not in the personal finance space, but in the
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.960]   economic space.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.880]   There's a big theme that runs around about potential inflation, deflation, all of these
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.480]   macroeconomic issues.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.600]   If you watch what's happening in Greece right now with the changes in the Eurozone, these
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.520]   are very important topics.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.600]   There are very few people who are effectively giving some kind of middle tier information,
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.000]   not just what you see when you're watching the evening newscast and not what you have
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.960]   to read when you read an economics book.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.360]   Not many people are doing a middle of the road discussion.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.360]   I'd like to really do that.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.800]   I'd like to provide some of that content.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.880]   It's time consuming to do it well and to effectively articulate it without getting on the microphone
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.680]   and saying the same thing over and over again.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.480]   It takes a lot of time.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:59.280]   I'm going to be backing off a little bit on the number of shows as far as the deep dive,
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.320]   hour a day shows that I release on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:08.960]   I'm also going to be focusing in on the content that seems to be the most popular with you,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   the audience, which is Q&A.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.240]   I'm going to be doing a lot more Q&A going forward.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.680]   I have a whole list of questions from many of you that I have not answered.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.560]   I have many questions lined up that I have not answered and I need to start answering
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   those questions.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.600]   I'm going to be doing that in a variety of formats.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.120]   The first thing is I'm going to be doing and creating much more video.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.360]   I plan to answer some Q&A in the context of video.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.760]   Video has a unique place as far as a format.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.840]   I love audio podcasting.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:45.240]   However, there's a tremendous value to YouTube and to the video marketplace.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.840]   There are some things that you can do in video that you can't do in audio.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.800]   I chose to start by focusing on audio because I believe that is my core competency.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.160]   That's what I believe has the most benefit.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.080]   Much of the information that I share on the show does not effectively articulate over
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   to video.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   With video, many times people are looking for shorter content.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.680]   Just frankly with finance, there's not so much that you need to see.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.120]   There's a lot that just you need to hear.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.140]   I think audio is much more flexible.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.140]   It can be released.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.280]   It requires less bandwidth.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.800]   It can be consumed while you're on the go.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.920]   So I've waited on video.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.760]   However, there is I believe a really growing hunger for people looking for information
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   with video.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.360]   So I plan to start doing a lot more regular video releases for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.120]   One of the aspects of that is I'm going to be doing Q&A.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.760]   So I'm anticipating – I was going to say five minutes but when am I ever going to be
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.560]   able to answer a question in five minutes?
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.800]   I don't see that happening.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.680]   I'm anticipating 10 to 20-minute videos as far as answering Q&A.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.440]   I've thought about should I just release that on YouTube and make all of the podcast
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.160]   listeners go over to YouTube or should I try to cross that over?
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.280]   Should I try to start a new channel on audio or what should I do?
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.040]   What I've decided to do is to simply adjust the format of Radical Personal Finance and
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:14.720]   release the audio for shorter format questions into the RSS feed, so into what shows up on
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:21.920]   your phone directly whether you're using iTunes or whether you're using my personal Radical
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.080]   Personal Finance app, however you're listening to it.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.480]   The reason is I really want to serve you with some of the content.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   Most people don't do this.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.520]   I've tried to figure out whether it's a smart thing to do or not.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.560]   Most people would split it out into a different channel and try to get people on different
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:44.080]   platforms but in my mind what I'm thinking of is how can I serve you, the core audience?
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.600]   If I'm the listener of a show that I really like and if that show releases some long format
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.860]   episodes that are an hour long or two hours long or an hour and a half long and then they
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.120]   also release some 10-minute episodes, I just as soon have them show up in the same place.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.240]   The reason is because I'm going to listen when and where I want and my thought is I'm
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240]   an adult.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.040]   I can look at your podcast feed if you're a podcaster and see, "Okay, here's a 10-minute
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   one.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   Let me listen to the 10-minute one and here's an hour one.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.440]   Let me listen to the hour one," and I can just go ahead and consume that.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.240]   You should be aware that in the future there's going to be a lot more shorter format content
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.800]   showing up into your podcast feed.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.440]   Some of it may be repetitive to ideas that we've talked about in the past.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.960]   There's still going to be long format content released here and you're just going to see
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   those labeled.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.160]   I'll try to label them clearly in the description somehow so you can know, "Okay, this is YouTube
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:44.040]   audio that's also showing up as a Q&A," and/or, "This is a normal episode of Radical Personal
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.320]   Finance."
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.000]   My hope is that you could just simply choose what's going to be valuable to you.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.840]   I will be releasing content on the video feed that I won't release into the audio feed.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.420]   That content will be things that are intensely visual.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.960]   That's where the breakdown often comes is if I'm speaking to you about something that
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.720]   is visual and you're listening to the audio only, which is showing up in your phone and
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.040]   I'm constantly referring to, "Well, look here and look at this and here's a consideration
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.400]   and look at this illustration," that can be maddening for an audio listener.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.440]   So I will be creating a lot of video content going forward in the future that I won't release
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   as audio.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.720]   But if there's something that I believe is easily digested as both, I will release it
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.000]   as audio and you can just simply look at it and decide, "Do I want to watch the video
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.580]   of this and actually see Joshua talking or do I just want to listen to this and hear
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.920]   Joshua talking?"
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.240]   And I'll just leave that up to you.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.840]   I also plan to be releasing a number of shorter format shows, almost like the coaching shows
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.880]   that I've done the last couple of weeks.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.740]   And I believe this is really, really important because this is filling kind of that crossover
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.760]   niche in personal finance.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.200]   There's too much talk in finance on the technical details and not enough talk on some of the
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   other aspects of finance.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.400]   I've worked with some people in an office recently and as I've worked with them, I have
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:15.600]   observed that – I just observed the dynamic of their working environment.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.160]   I said, "These people aren't going to have a job."
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.560]   In the next recession, these people are not going to have a job.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.160]   If I were the boss – and I know the bosses and I've worked with the bosses – they
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.720]   would be the first on the chopping block.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:31.440]   It's not a matter of – it's just some simple things, some simple personal development
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.800]   stuff, some simple things.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.960]   That stuff needs to be addressed.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:43.360]   And so I plan to be also releasing to you just some of the shorter format focused ideas
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.920]   on here's a specific idea.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.040]   It doesn't merit a long introduction to the show.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.640]   It doesn't merit a long outro to the show.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.200]   It's just a specific idea but I think it can be really valuable.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.900]   So you're also going to see some of those things show up and a lot of that won't be
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   video.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.240]   It's just going to be adding some different variety to your feed.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.000]   So don't expect – the synthesis of all of that is don't expect all of the shows
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.600]   going forward to be the normal 45 minutes to an hour length of radical personal finance.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:20.080]   Expect the frequency to vary as time goes on and also look to see the labels and you'll
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.760]   be able to figure out where this is from.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.200]   I think that will be really useful to you.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:32.080]   The core idea of radical personal finance is to be your guide and your encouragement
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.680]   to financial independence.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.080]   That's the core idea.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   That's it.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.240]   That's what I can tell you.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:44.940]   So the other reason why I'm making this change is I really want to do some interviews
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.960]   on things that aren't often done.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.120]   The biggest – one of the bigger frustrations that I've had over the past weeks is I
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.960]   haven't been able to bring you the interviews that I've wanted to bring you.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.840]   It's hard to get some of the people that I want to interview to sit down and do interviews.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:06.440]   But I want to do some really deep dive discussions with people who are – I want to bring you
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.520]   Jack Bogle on the show.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:14.280]   I want to bring you Mohamed El-Erian.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.280]   I want to bring you Bill Gross.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.840]   I want to bring you an economist.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:23.360]   I want to bring you some of the billionaires that come to Palm Beach and then live here
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.320]   during the season.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.600]   I simply haven't been able to get that content done because of the amount of time I've
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.240]   been putting into all the other content.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:38.040]   If I look at basically the 40 to 50 hours a week that I spend creating the five-day
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.760]   per week show, it doesn't leave enough time for me to do the additional work of figuring
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.640]   out how to get networked through to some of the billionaires that live here in Palm Beach
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.160]   or that come down and visit, some of the business tycoons, some of those people.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.600]   I really feel that's a market that's not being tapped.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.160]   If you want to hear an interview with an internet entrepreneur, there are about a gazillion
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   of them out there.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.920]   If you want to hear – I'm not saying it's bad.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.840]   I'm just saying there's other people doing that stuff.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.280]   There's no reason for me to waste my time doing things that other people are doing well
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.640]   and interviewing the same people that go around on every different show.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.600]   Rather, I'm going to be bringing you the content that I can bring you that's uniquely
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.520]   useful and uniquely valuable.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.720]   So that's the information going forward.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.320]   So what can you do to get connected and what are some of the changes going forward?
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.040]   I'm also going to ask you for some help and then we'll be done for the day.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.040]   Number one, the email newsletter is working again after months of problems.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.760]   So sign up for the email newsletter, RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.920]   Sign up, confirm and verify and that would be the best way to keep an eye on all of the
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.200]   content going forward.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.260]   That will be your best outlet.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.240]   So sign up for the email newsletter if you will.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.640]   I won't spam you but that way I'll try to make sure that I send out – if it's
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   a YouTube video or if it's show notes or whatever, do that.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.800]   I'm also going to be doing more writing.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.440]   I've been doing – posting more content on the site, more book reviews.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.960]   Oh, that was the other thing I meant to mention, book reviews.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.340]   For example, I've got a bunch of audio from some book reviews.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.760]   This is three-minute audio, four-minute audio from YouTube that I've been releasing on
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   the YouTube channel.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.800]   I'm just going to go ahead and slide that audio into the RSS feed because many of you
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.480]   won't want to watch a three-minute video but you'll listen to a quick three-minute
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.480]   book review and it will say, "Ah, that's a book that would be useful," or, "Oh,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.040]   that's a book that I'm going to ignore."
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.680]   Obviously it's not too repetitive to concepts that I have mentioned before.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.800]   I'm not taking the same content and recycling it which is what many people would recommend
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   that I do.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.320]   I'm not just adjusting it and recycling it.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.000]   So again, listen on a fast speed and it won't take that much time.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Sign up for the email newsletter.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.320]   I've got that working again.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.520]   Number two, I'm going to start using the hashtag #AskRPF on Twitter.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.080]   If you would like – if you have a question that you would like me to answer, please tag
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.480]   it with the hashtag #AskRPF.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.240]   I'm also going to be starting to do some additional social media discussions.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.840]   I'm going to be doing some Twitter chats, #AskRPF on Twitter and also some Periscope
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.680]   Q&A sessions.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.000]   The key is follow me @JoshuaSheets.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.120]   I think I'm going to shut down the @RadicalPF Twitter handle.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.680]   I don't like running two accounts and it really annoys me to do two accounts.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.760]   Just follow me @JoshuaSheets and ask questions there.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.880]   Use the hashtag #AskRPF and I'm going to be doing some Twitter chats and Periscope
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.680]   sessions on video Q&A.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:35.680]   The best way to keep abreast of that is follow me on Periscope @JoshuaSheets and on Twitter.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.800]   If you're not familiar with Periscope, it's an app that does real-time live video streaming.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.680]   Super easy because you don't have to fire up the computer.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.920]   It's all done right from the mobile device.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   It's pretty cool.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.700]   So I'm going to be doing more of that and I will use those questions and funnel those
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.840]   into the YouTube content.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:58.480]   I also have some of your other questions that I'll be using as YouTube content as well.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.320]   Finally for today, if you want to help, some of you in the past have made offers to help
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.360]   me with the show.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.320]   And so still bootstrapping this thing, kind of a one-man band, I'm going to be reaching
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.920]   out to some of you who have offered to help me in the past.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.320]   But I'll just go ahead and mention it here.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.880]   There are some things that I could use some help with.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.200]   And these are things that I will hire if I don't have a volunteer.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.400]   But it would help me if any of you just want to volunteer to help me with some things,
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   then here are some things that would be useful.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.860]   Number one, if any of you would like to help me with some notes on audio episodes and some
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.280]   time stamping as far as so I could put in the notes, time stamping, here's what the
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.460]   conversation was, here's what the conversation was, that would be really useful.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.520]   I haven't made the time to make that happen.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.480]   I've been focused on creating new content rather than trying to more effectively package
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.200]   the old content, but that would be useful.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.400]   If any of you have skills with graphic design, I could use some help with simple graphic
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.400]   design.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.120]   Again, I can hire that, Don.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.840]   I've done it in different ways.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.360]   But little things like making a fancy little graphic for the topic of the day, making a
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.400]   YouTube thumbnail for me, some of those kinds of things would be really useful.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.640]   I also could use some simple video editing and some simple audio editing.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.660]   So if any of you would like to do that, it's a matter of splicing together some audio bits
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.960]   and then on the video editing, it's a matter of taking some video from, for example, interviews
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.360]   that I'm going to do, things like that, and putting that together.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.440]   And then just some general help uploading and managing some different things on the
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   site.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:31.560]   What happens when running a site is all these little things don't take that long in the
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.640]   individual, but in the aggregate, they take a long time.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.120]   So if any of you just like to help me with some of those things on a volunteer basis,
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.680]   that would be great.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:46.240]   Or if you work in those areas, feel free to let me know and I'd be glad to consider working
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   with you.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.760]   So in summary, I guess, oh, the other thing I'm going to scrap the outro.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   I'm tired of it.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.780]   I don't know if you're supposed to have a disclaimer or not, but I'm tired of it as
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.520]   far as the disclaimer that I play at the end.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   I'm going to shorten that up.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.320]   I think that's those things I wanted to share with you.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.120]   So thank you each and every one of you for having been here and for listening to the
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.360]   show for last year.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.680]   It's been awesome.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.840]   Without your feedback, who knows, maybe I would have quit.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.660]   But each and every one of your pieces of feedback has been awesome.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:24.920]   As we close as far as this week, so next week I will be at Podcast Movement in Texas.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.480]   I'll be doing a Radical Personal Finance meetup.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.660]   As soon as I get these shows published, then that's one of the things I'm going to be working
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.720]   on is picking a time and the schedule.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   So I'll be at a Podcast Movement.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.400]   I think it's in Fort Worth, driving out there.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.280]   So I'll share some follow on the social media stuff if you care.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.320]   I'll try to do a better job posting.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:52.440]   I don't post as much as I probably should.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.480]   The thing that would be really helpful, going into Podcast Movement, I would love to go
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.240]   out there with Radical Personal Finance in something like the top 10 in the investing
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.320]   segment of iTunes.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.120]   So what would be really cool, if you haven't done it, and a bunch of you have this last
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.880]   over this weekend, if you haven't done it, please leave an iTunes review or any other
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.160]   platform as well.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.080]   So just take a moment, leave a quick rating and review on iTunes.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.840]   That would be super useful.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.120]   That'll help push the show up and that would be fun to be at Podcast Movement as a top
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.540]   10 podcaster.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.080]   That would stroke my ego a little bit and make me feel really good.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.640]   So if you haven't left an iTunes review yet, please do that.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.200]   Also if you haven't signed up, if you're one of the 4,300 daily listeners who are
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.680]   not one of the 200 patrons, 4,500 people listening and 200 of you signed up to support the show,
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.280]   please consider becoming a patron.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.080]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.200]   You can sign up for as little as a dollar a month or as much as a couple hundred bucks
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   a month.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.640]   The more money, the more access you get to me.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.000]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.280]   Thank you to each and every one of you who does that.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.880]   I appreciate you more than you know.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.280]   It's been an awesome ride this last year and I am excited about this next year.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.680]   I'm going to take over the world.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   Got the plan in my head.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.120]   I've just got to get the work done to make it happen.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.280]   Thank you all so much.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.800]   Have you experienced Slotzilla?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.980]   The world's ultimate zip line is at Fremont Street Experience in fabulous downtown Las
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:19.980]   Vegas.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.560]   Enjoy the thrill with two ways to fly.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.420]   Take off on the lower zip line from seven stories high and fly three blocks down Fremont
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   Street.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:33.920]   The higher zoom line launches flyer superhero style from 11 stories, traveling five blocks
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.520]   under the world's largest video screen.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.720]   Come zip or zoom Vegas style.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.960]   VegasExperience.com for tickets.
