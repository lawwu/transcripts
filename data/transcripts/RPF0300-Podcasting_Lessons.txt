[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.160]   Today on Radical Personal Finance we celebrate 300 episodes of the show.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.040]   And last week we hit a pretty cool milestone, over 2 million total downloads of Radical
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.380]   Personal Finance in the time that we've been doing this show.
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.420]   Almost two years, about a year and, what are we at, a year and 10 months or so.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.600]   And so today we're going to set aside the normal financial content and we're going to
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   talk podcasting.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800]   I'm going to talk to you about the business of podcasting, the technology of podcasting
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.040]   and the opportunity of podcasting because it's my hope that each and every one of you
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:26.480]   listening to this voice will start a podcast.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.160]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.640]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.880]   Broadcasting on location today.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.680]   I guess podcasting on location.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   I am in Nashville, Tennessee attending a conference and I've pulled myself aside into a side room,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.000]   found a table to sit at, got my iPhone on the table and I'm going to share with you
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   over 30 lessons on podcasting.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:58.600]   Things that I've learned the hard way and I'd like to save you some time.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.160]   Normally on Radical Personal Finance we talk day in and out about how to live a rich life
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.880]   That is the theme of this show.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.200]   And although today we're not going to be talking about IRAs or investments or stocks or real
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.680]   estate or any of that stuff, we're going to talk about podcasting.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.000]   This may serve you toward that goal.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.080]   I probably shouldn't have scared you away in the beginning by saying no financial content
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   today.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.680]   Podcasting has been the cornerstone of my financial freedom plan.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.360]   That was a major part of it.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.960]   Not the only thing, but a major thing because when I set out to do this show, I did it very
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.560]   intentionally while building a plan for financial freedom.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.080]   And frankly, I have, thankfully, thank you to every, thankfully to every one of you who
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   have been a part of this.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.640]   I've been able to achieve some very satisfying initial measures of financial freedom based
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.760]   upon this podcast.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.200]   I'm able to support my family and meet the needs of my family based upon income from
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   you, my listening audience.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.360]   And I'm able to do it in a way that is very gratifying for me.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.040]   It's very enjoyable for me.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   I get to talk about things that I love to talk about and it provides a lifestyle that
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.840]   is just really, really cool.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.800]   And so I owe a debt of gratitude to those who've gone before me and I want to pay that
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.960]   forward and just share all the lessons I've learned about podcasting.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.280]   And I don't want you to think that I think I'm not the world's greatest podcaster.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   I'm learning.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.240]   I don't know all there is to know about podcasting.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   Many of you listening perhaps know far more about the techie side, but I know something
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.240]   about the business side and I know something about building an audience because this show
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.720]   has not happened by accident and you'll hear that in today's show.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.600]   I have many listeners who have listened to all 300 episodes of the show and you can ask
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.760]   anyone in that situation and they will attest to you that this has not happened by accident.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.440]   So I do feel confident that I've got some lessons that I want to share with you and
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.680]   I hope these will help many of you do things a little faster and better than I have.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.640]   So let's start with lesson number one and it's really this.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.400]   I want each and every one of you listening to this show to start a podcast.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.320]   And the most important reason for you starting a podcast is not so that you will be able
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.480]   to say like Joshua, "Hey, I'm on 300 episodes and I can make my living from a podcast."
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.840]   It's not so that you can make lots of money on a show.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.980]   It's so that you can transform yourself from a consumer to a producer.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.520]   We are in this fascinating time in the world that we live in of a complete transformation
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.340]   of society where many of the means of production, the methods of production that have happened
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.960]   in the past, the way that people have shared their content, these are radically changing.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.080]   And the most important thing for you, for your career success, for your business success
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.520]   is for you to transform yourself from a mere consumer of content, consumer of information,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.160]   consumer of entertainment into a producer.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.040]   And I know of very few ways that are better to do that than a podcast.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.480]   We're in this wild and woolly frontier of podcasting right now where there's tremendous
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.000]   opportunity, which means there's a lot of things that won't work and a lot of things
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.060]   that will work.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.320]   But if you get started now on building and developing a podcast, you'll start the process
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.040]   of transforming yourself from a consumer of content to a producer of content.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.600]   And if you'll transform yourself in that manner, I promise you it will have a measurable impact
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.000]   on your life.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.500]   Now, it doesn't have to be a podcast.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.320]   It could be written content.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.920]   You could submit articles to the publications and journals that are influential in your
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   industry.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.060]   You could write a column for your local newspaper.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.040]   You can write a blog and publish it online.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.900]   You can write inspirational and thought-provoking posts on your Facebook page.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.620]   You can also create YouTube videos.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.620]   You can create Vine.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.160]   You can do something, but you've got to transform yourself from a consumer to a producer because
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.640]   the future belongs to those who are producers.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.480]   Podcasting is a really great way to do it.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.700]   The fundamentally most valuable thing that has happened for me with podcasting is I've
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.860]   been able to make that transformation.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.920]   And sitting here from almost two years after, I spent, for those of you who are just tuning
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.680]   into the podcast for the first time just because of the title about podcasting advice, I spent
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.160]   six years working as a financial advisor.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.380]   And as a financial advisor, I was barred from being able to create public-facing media based
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.120]   upon the industry regulations.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.440]   Now, at the time, I submitted myself to that voluntarily.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.880]   In retrospect, I don't know if I could ever go back behind that curtain simply because
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.920]   it's too damaging to your career.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.320]   It's too damaging to your brand, to your business, to your job prospects, or to your just enjoyment
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.760]   and entertainment prospects to be stuck in a place where you can't produce interesting,
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.080]   compelling content because the future belongs in many ways to those who are producers.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:10.600]   So my challenge to you is today, first and foremost, are you doing something that is
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:18.080]   transforming you from a consumer to a producer and that is enabling you to help some other
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.840]   people with your content?
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.240]   That's lesson number one.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:28.480]   Number two, there's a lot of talk in podcasting about finance and about making money.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:36.020]   And I hope that that talk about finance and making money can have a positive influence.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.220]   Even I led and I said, "Hey, I make a living on my podcast."
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.220]   But I want to be clear.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.840]   I am not today going to talk about the financial opportunities of podcasts.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.280]   I'll talk a little bit of the business of podcasting, but I don't have any reason to
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.760]   tell you about all the financial opportunities of podcasting because I don't have anything
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   to sell you.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.580]   And I'm going to tell you straight up, the biggest benefit that I have received from
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:05.440]   podcasting is not financial, although I'm very thankful for the financial benefits,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.640]   but it's rather the people that I've been connected with.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.900]   I have built from podcasting relationships with many of you who are listening to this
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.900]   show right now that I hope will continue for the rest of my life.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:25.000]   And those are relationships that would not have been forged if I was not creating some
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.600]   form of public content.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.240]   So we've got to consider the finances.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:35.600]   I'll give you more lessons on finance, but recognize that the biggest benefit you will
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.920]   receive from podcasting is probably not going to be financial, but rather the people that
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.320]   you will be able to connect with.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:52.560]   Next lesson, if you are interested in getting into podcasting, do not get bogged down in
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.300]   the tech.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.960]   The tech of podcasting is the easiest thing for you to solve.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.320]   And I'm going to tell you in just a couple of minutes how to solve it.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.660]   But the biggest problem that I see in talking about new podcasters is that they are incredibly
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.500]   focused on the tech.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.440]   They focus on what microphone do I buy and what software do I use and what mixer do I
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.620]   need and where do I host my audio files and all of that stuff.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.480]   Don't get bogged down in the tech.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.840]   That is the easiest thing to solve.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.280]   And it has gotten immeasurably easier in the last couple of years since I've been doing
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.520]   this than it was two years ago.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.660]   And in a year from now, it'll be easier and easier and easier.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.180]   Don't get bogged down in the tech.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:41.000]   The tech is not your ticket to success in this business or industry or endeavor.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.360]   Spend 80% of your time focused on your editorial plan and 20% of the time focusing on your
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.780]   tech plan.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:55.600]   Because if you are a podcaster or aspiring to become one, your audience does not care
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.920]   what microphone you're recording on.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.000]   They don't care how you process your audio file.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.480]   They don't even particularly care about the quality of your ums and ahs removal.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.280]   They care about your content.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:13.680]   So spend the majority of your time focusing on your content.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   Don't try to copy somebody's ideas about their format.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.120]   Focus on your content and fit your format to your content.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.000]   Get very clear on what you're trying to do and why you're doing it.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.320]   And then plan your podcast around that.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   When I started Radical Personal Finance, I sat down in the middle of my guest bedroom
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.640]   with a, I don't know, I keep saying $10, $15, with a cheap audio recorder, a $10 or $15
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   audio recorder.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:49.160]   It was a handheld MP3 recorder that came with my Dragon Naturally Speaking software.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.080]   I held it in my hand, I hit record, and I started talking for 45, and it was for about
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.880]   40 minutes, 30 minutes, something like that.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.720]   And I laid out what I thought the vision of my show would be.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.520]   If you are interested, go back and listen to it.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   It's episode one of the show.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.840]   You can find it in the archives, radicalpersonalfinance.com/archives, or it'll be archived in the feed.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.760]   So you can go back and listen to it today.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.160]   And to this day, there have been times I've gone back and listened to it, the vision of
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.800]   what I am still building with Radical Personal Finance, it has not changed.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.440]   And I have fit everything that I've done based upon that vision.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.240]   And I've had all kinds of people come to me and say, "Well, you should do this and you
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   should do that."
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.120]   And my response has been, "This is my vision."
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.400]   Now I have changed many things that I've done.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.840]   I've realized many mistakes that I have made, but I have been single-minded and focused
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.680]   on here is the vision of what I'm going to create.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:47.160]   So don't worry about tech and don't get bogged down in some kind of magical format.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.280]   Focus first on your content and your vision, and then ask yourself what would be the most
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.720]   effective way for me to accomplish this vision?
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.000]   What format fits this content, fits what I'm trying to do?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.280]   Now let's talk a little bit about podcast formats.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.320]   There are a few major, very popular podcast formats in today's market.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.240]   That's number one, interview shows.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.960]   There is a massive proliferation of interview shows.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.360]   The way this works is you're the show host, you find someone to interview, you sit down
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.600]   with them in person or virtually, and you record an interview.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.480]   So let's call that an interview show.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.960]   Another podcast format would be a co-hosted show.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   You and a co-host or multiple co-hosts sit down together, you have a conversation, a
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.640]   recorded conversation, and talk about those things.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.720]   Another format would be solo shows where you just sit down with a microphone and you talk.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.880]   And then another format would be what I'll call the carefully edited NPR-type shows,
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.240]   the things like the—I'm blanking on all the—but the big This American Life type
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.760]   of shows, just these beautiful masterpieces of audio engineering where there's interviews
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.040]   and there's story and everything's woven together.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:06.240]   Now the natural inclination of many people is to jump onto one of those formats.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.720]   I've done three of them.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.480]   I have done interview shows, I've done co-hosted shows, and I have solo shows.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.080]   So Radical Personal Finance is a combination of a solo show, me speaking directly to you,
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.120]   it's just me on the microphone, and interview shows.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.000]   I usually do about two interviews a week.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.520]   I also have an additional podcast called Encouraging Christian Fathers that is a co-hosted show
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   with—I actually do it with me and my dad.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.440]   So I have experience in those three formats.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.760]   I have zero experience in the carefully edited NPR-type shows.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.240]   But what I would encourage you is to ignore what's working for someone else and focus
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.000]   on what will work for you.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.300]   Don't worry about what other people are doing.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.400]   Do your thing and create the show that will best fit your vision.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:55.840]   I have seen shows be successful in every format, almost every format imaginable.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:02.080]   I'll just name a few podcasts that I'm aware of or that I like or that I think are cool.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.600]   So the most popular podcasts seem to be these carefully edited, beautifully produced masterpieces
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.320]   of audio engineering.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.240]   This would be a show like Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, where it's just an incredible story
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.500]   built together, or the shows like This American Life, things like that, with these just masterpieces.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.460]   Those are extremely popular because they're extremely accessible to many people.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.460]   You may or may not be able to create that kind of show.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.920]   I have zero ability to create that kind of show when I started, so I just completely
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.500]   ignore that segment of the market.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.320]   I don't ever think my show will be as popular as those types of shows, but that's okay.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.600]   I don't have the ability currently of doing that type of show, and I don't particularly
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.120]   care to develop that ability.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.480]   That's not what I want to do.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.360]   So I kind of write those things off.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.360]   There are interview shows that are short.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.960]   There are interview shows that are long that are popular.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.420]   There are solo shows that are short.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.560]   There are solo shows that are long.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.840]   There are co-hosted shows that are short.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   There are shows that are long.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.520]   One of my favorite podcasts is a show called Peace Revolution.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.600]   It's very popular.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.120]   You'll find it very thought-provoking if you ever listen to it.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   The longest episode I've ever listened to on that show was a 19-hour podcast episode.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.000]   So those of you who are regular listeners of Radical Personal Finance, if you think
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.020]   I do long shows, the longest show I listened to was 19 hours.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:23.400]   But in that context, 19 hours was the amount of time that was required for that show to
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.040]   be successful with its purpose and its mission.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.740]   And so 19 hours was appropriate.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.560]   So focus on the format that will fit your content and it will accomplish the vision.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.440]   Don't get bogged down in copying anybody else.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:45.280]   Almost everything you do or almost everything you're told with creating a podcast is irrelevant.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.640]   Your intro music is not very relevant.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.920]   Is it a little bit relevant?
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   Sure.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.320]   But that's not going to make the difference necessarily.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.800]   The logo, is that important?
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   Sure.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.260]   You need a logo that's going to show up in iTunes.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.100]   But beyond that, you don't need a lot of that stuff.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.660]   What matters is the fact that you're creating a piece of audio content or video, if that's
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.340]   your thing, but you're creating content that's appropriate to your objective.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.300]   And if your vision is being fulfilled by the content that you're creating, then you'll
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.660]   know that you are being successful.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.460]   Next lesson, let's talk about frequency.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.960]   I am convinced that quality trumps frequency.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.860]   Better to create higher quality content than more frequent content.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:38.340]   But the problem with this is frequency is probably more likely to lead to quality because
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.180]   you may or may not be able to control quality.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.020]   Realistically, probably most of our productive work is driven by a Pareto distribution.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.900]   I have not gone through my content archives and checked to see, but if I did, I would
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:58.100]   guess that 20% of my shows are covering 80% of the downloads or 80% of the popularity.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.220]   We can't produce all of our stuff as being hits.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.340]   But what we can do is focus on producing.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.800]   So here's how I have handled this in the history of my show, Radical Personal Finance.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.820]   In the beginning, I committed wholeheartedly to frequency.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.220]   And I did that intentionally, knowing that I couldn't control quality.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.260]   I would do my best, but I didn't have any former podcasting, broadcast skills.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.060]   I didn't have a lot of practice.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.700]   I never did know what I was doing.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.780]   And I knew I would need to do a lot of something in order to learn those basic skills.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.700]   If you're interested, there's a show in the archives of Radical Personal Finance called
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.340]   Why I Do a Daily Podcast and Why You Should Model but Not Necessarily Copy Me.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.840]   And that lays out that whole argument of why I was focused on doing a frequent show, trying
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.140]   to do a five-day-a-week show.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.940]   At this point in time, I'm convinced it's more important for me to do a show that's
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:52.120]   quality than necessarily a frequent show.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.900]   So I'm still trying to do frequent shows.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.380]   I probably at this point am averaging about three to four per week.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.600]   But quality is my number one goal, trying to create higher quality.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.100]   So quality will trump frequency, but you've got to balance that with the fact that frequency
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.780]   is probably how you're going to learn to do quality.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.340]   So commit yourself to lots of production.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.220]   Next lesson, enjoy the journey as you get started because as you get bigger and bigger,
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.740]   the stress is just going to grow.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.740]   So focus on enjoying the steps.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.660]   I thought when I started, I remember the first day I had 100 downloads and the first day
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.100]   I had 500 downloads and the first day I had 1,000 downloads and those things.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.860]   I thought, "Oh man, it's going to be awesome when I get to a day when I have 10,000 downloads."
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.440]   Well, I've gotten days where I've gotten over 10,000 downloads.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440]   It doesn't feel any different.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.540]   In fact, it was probably more exciting in the beginning.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.140]   Now I'm thankful for the downloads.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.820]   You hear that by any means.
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.540]   It's an honor for people to pay attention to your content and to your message.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:53.060]   But I also have so much work associated with it now that often a little bit of the joy
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.060]   has gone out.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:59.100]   I host these two shows, Radical Personal Finance, but my best guest probably has somewhere between
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.760]   8,000 to 10,000 regular daily subscribers.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.840]   Some shows have gotten far more downloads than that.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.100]   That seems to be the regular base of shows a couple of weeks in the background.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.420]   We'll talk about stats in a minute so that you can interpret stats because you need to
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.420]   do that.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.420]   You need to learn how to interpret stats.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.460]   So, 8,000 to 10,000 listeners per show.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.260]   I have another show, Encouraging Christian Fathers.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.820]   That one gets, most of those episodes now are about 700 to 800 downloads on that show.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.040]   I often get more joy out of seeing the nice little spikes on Encouraging Christian Fathers
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.700]   than I do from Radical Personal Finance simply because I've gotten a little bit immune to
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.700]   the large downloads.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:44.100]   So, my point is to simply say, focus on enjoying the journey and the process rather than focusing
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.060]   on the hard numbers.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:53.620]   Next lesson, a podcast is not a business.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.980]   A podcast is not a business.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.380]   A podcast might be a great marketing tool for your business.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.540]   A podcast might form the foundation of a business.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:12.260]   A podcast might be a useful component of your business, but a podcast is not a business.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:18.140]   So, give careful time and attention to the purpose of your podcast.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.740]   A podcast could be an awesome hobby.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.380]   It could be an important occupation.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.500]   It could be important ministry.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.320]   It can be something that you're doing for reasons that are important to you.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.940]   But if you desire to use a podcast as a component of your financial endeavors, recognize that
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.980]   a podcast is not a business.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:47.700]   You need to recognize that the vast majority of shows are not going to be numerically successful.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.300]   Most shows get perhaps a couple of hundred people who will listen to each show.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.860]   The median number, I don't have the stats in front of me, but it's something like 400
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.580]   to 500 downloads per episode is the median.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.540]   50% of shows have less than that.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.660]   50% of shows have more than that.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.340]   So, recognizing that's the reality, you're going to be fighting and building a show.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.940]   You're going to be fighting against that large marketplace.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.740]   So in order for you to be successful, I'm convinced you need to want to do your show
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:20.060]   even if nobody listens.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.580]   You should want to do your show even if nobody listens.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.080]   So here's my advice.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.680]   Create the show you want to do and listen to even if nobody listens.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.620]   When I began Radical Personal Finance, I made an intentional commitment.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.620]   It's written down.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.340]   I make very few commitments, but this was an intentional commitment.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.700]   I said, "I will do 1,000 episodes of Radical Personal Finance even if nobody listens because
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.060]   by doing the episodes, I'm building something that I want to do.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.500]   I'm creating something that I think should exist.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.580]   If nobody listens, I'm okay with that."
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.940]   Now, I would certainly not have as much energy behind it.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.980]   I certainly would not be as excited about doing it.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.140]   I'm not saying that.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.700]   Of course, numbers matter and I'm much more excited to do the show if people are listening,
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.300]   but that was my personal commitment.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.720]   So create the show that you want to do even if nobody listens.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.540]   Next lesson, don't worry about your brand if you don't yet have one.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.180]   One of the major things I see people falling apart on is spending so much time on the things
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:22.580]   that are difficult, building a beautiful brand, a beautiful website, a great world-class logo,
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.680]   building a brand when they don't have anything that exists in the first place.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.940]   So just get something to the marketplace as quickly as possible and your brand will grow
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.500]   as you go on.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.480]   I've never figured out up until the last month or so, I've never really figured out what
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.820]   is the tagline of my show.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.580]   I didn't have that perfect, succinct synopsis of what is the tagline of my show.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.640]   So therefore, my branding efforts and marketing efforts have been inferior, but I didn't know
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   what it was.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.900]   I had a lot of things I wanted to talk about.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.480]   Now I'm more and more conscious of exactly what it is and I know why I have chosen it.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.140]   But if you don't have a brand, don't worry about that.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.940]   There is, of course, for some of you, a corollary to that.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:07.500]   If you have an established brand, you need to worry about and protect that brand.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.180]   So not everybody should just go out and start a fly-by-night podcast on a cheap budget,
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.180]   on a shoestring budget that doesn't sound very good.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:19.320]   The other day, an example of this, this can really reflect poorly on you.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.420]   Best example, there's a book, a popular book called The E-Myth.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.900]   The author's name is Michael Gerber.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.380]   It's an excellent book.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.780]   If you've not read it or you're not familiar with it, I recommend it.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.780]   It's an excellent book.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.980]   Well, I went to see if he had a podcast.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.500]   And he does really high-quality work in his writing.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.500]   He's got all these great books.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.300]   I went to see if he has a podcast and downloaded the podcast, and the podcast was terrible.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.100]   It was hosted on BlogTalk Radio.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   It was totally informal.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.720]   He's calling in from a cell phone, and it just really reflected poorly on his brand,
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.140]   in my opinion.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.100]   And I didn't stick around as long as I would have to see if the content was good, just
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.140]   simply because the whole formatting of it was so terrible.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.300]   So if you do have a brand, then you should make sure that you are protecting that brand.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.660]   But if you don't have a brand, just get busy and get started.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.980]   Next, you've got to be confident.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.260]   If you've got a vision, and the reason that's so important is you've got to be confident
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.700]   in what you're doing because there will probably come a point in time where you've got to ignore
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.860]   the advice of other people.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:21.940]   And I have had to intentionally ignore personally many pieces of advice that well-meaning, knowledgeable
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:27.860]   experts have given me because I was convinced that there was a different opportunity, that
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.780]   I had a vision of something that I could do.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.660]   I believe it's valuable to listen to experts.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.860]   Experts probably know what they're talking about.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.780]   I will never be able to prove that I would have done better off if I had followed...
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.780]   If I had...
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.100]   Let me figure out how to phrase this.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.580]   There are pieces of advice that I ignored, and I can't prove that I should have ignored
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.580]   them.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.100]   What I know is that I had reasons for ignoring them, and I focused on my reason of what I
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:03.220]   was going to do, and I have built more success than many other people.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.900]   Would I have been more successful if I followed the expert's advice?
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.900]   I don't know.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.900]   Time will tell.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.940]   But I've built more success, and I knew the reasons that I ignored those.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.500]   Let me give you an example.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.820]   Figure out which example to give here.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.980]   The best example would probably be, should I focus on marketing a show or should I focus
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.580]   on creating a show?
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.940]   The general advice is, in media creation, is to spend a small amount of your time producing
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.780]   and a large amount of your time marketing.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.700]   You should spend 20% of your time producing and 80% of your time marketing that content,
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.700]   or 10 or 90, whatever.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.700]   It doesn't matter.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.740]   The point is, spend more time marketing than producing.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:46.220]   When I sat down and built Radical Personal Finance, I had never actually done online
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220]   marketing.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.940]   I'd studied it, but I was never actually able to do it.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.860]   And I decided that my unique selling proposition, the differentiating factor that I could bring
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:02.780]   to the marketplace, was I had a depth of knowledge and ideas that many people didn't have.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:08.140]   And I saw a marketplace that was hungry for deeper content, more content, and across a
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.220]   broader range of topics.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:16.000]   So I single-mindedly focused not on marketing, but I single-mindedly focused on creating
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.180]   more content, deeper content, and trying to do better content.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.500]   That was my decision.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.020]   And I felt that if I focused simply on what I could do well, my hope was that the internet
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.820]   would work and that you all who are listeners of the show would help me with advertising
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.820]   the show.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.540]   If I could create something that was useful, a piece of content that solved an important
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.760]   problem or presented an important idea, my theory was that you would be able to find
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.120]   that useful and you would share it, and that that would lead to a better outcome rather
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.060]   than me buying ads or guest posting somewhere or something like that.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:59.360]   So I focused single-mindedly on creating more content, better content, and broader content,
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.040]   and I intentionally ignored marketing for the first year of the show.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.160]   I didn't have the capacity at that point in time to do both.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.660]   That doesn't mean that marketing is not important.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.200]   At this point in time, I am working intentionally on doing more and better marketing because
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.480]   now I've built a little bit more capacity than I had before.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.400]   But I had to have the confidence in my vision, and I had to have the confidence of creating
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.800]   what I wanted to see exist, creating what I would have wished existed, and ignore a
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.880]   lot of the advice because I wasn't able to put it into practice.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.640]   So be confident in what you're doing, and if you have that vision and you're consistent
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.920]   with building something toward that vision, you will likely have more success than if
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.640]   you just follow what everyone else is telling you to do.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.200]   Next lesson, your website is really not very important in the beginning.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.720]   In the beginning of a show's creation, your website is not important.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:00.600]   For over the first year of Radical Personal Finance, I had the basic theme of WordPress,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.760]   whatever that was installed.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.960]   I had a cheap logo at the top of the page, and I didn't put any pictures.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.200]   I just put text on there.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   Just a little bit of text.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   It was boring.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.240]   But the reality is, a podcast, people connect with you through audio.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.240]   So I tried to focus on creating good audio, and I ignored the website.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   I didn't have the capacity to build a world-class website at that point in time.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.260]   The show succeeded in spite of the website.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.640]   On the back end, your website is very important in the long run.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.920]   So since that point in time, as I was able to build the capacity, once I had traction,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.200]   I've since substantially upgraded the website, tried to make it much more beautiful.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:48.160]   I'm still working on trying to make it work better, make it better, make it more beautiful.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.440]   And before I say the but, it is important.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.320]   I have gotten many great opportunities that I can specifically trace toward having a good
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   website.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.100]   But in the beginning, it was not so.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.640]   So website is not all that important in the beginning.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.900]   Frankly, in a moment I'll tell you how I do the shows and what I would suggest to you.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.640]   Don't even set up a WordPress site, because it's just a hassle.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.920]   We'll get to that in just a moment.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.720]   The best thing that you can focus on, and here's the next lesson, best thing for you
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:24.360]   to focus on is focus on improving your broadcast skills first, foremost, and always.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:33.400]   Focus on improving your broadcast skills first, foremost, and always.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.740]   Because the tech will come and it will go.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.660]   Five years from now, we will not even recognize what we're doing today.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:47.860]   But if you've built skills, you'll be able to adjust to the technology that is changing
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.740]   and apply those skills.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.340]   Tech comes and goes.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.300]   Skills, talent, and knowledge don't come and go.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.860]   This is a major mistake.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.180]   I hear so many people talking about, "Oh, how can I improve my podcast?
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.140]   Is there a way that I can market it more?
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.980]   Is there a way that I can get a better microphone, a better audio quality?"
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.940]   Frankly, for many people who are asking those questions, the key thing to focus on is to
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.740]   say, "You're not a very good broadcaster."
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.180]   I'm not saying this to you as someone who has arrived.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:26.020]   Some of my early episodes were painful, are painful for me to go back and listen to.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.420]   I would love nothing more than just to strip them off the website.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.820]   I refuse to do that because I want to have them there as a light post that somebody can
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:39.120]   go and listen to my old episode and say, "Wow, Joshua was bad, and hopefully I'm a lot better
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.100]   now than I was then."
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:47.180]   And they'll say, "Wow, if Joshua was that bad and he's gotten this good, then that means
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:53.100]   that I can start something bad and become good," because the key is to start and to
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.680]   improve.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.420]   Focus on the most important things, which are your broadcast skills.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.860]   I am still—I'm not satisfied with my own broadcast skills.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.740]   I'm working hard to try to say, "How can I get better?"
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.780]   I go back and listen to my shows sometimes and I get upset with myself.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.980]   "Joshua, why did you go down that tangent?
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.140]   Why did you not make that point more concise?
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.680]   Why did you not hammer that emotional point home?
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.440]   Why did you not build more enthusiasm?
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.780]   Why didn't you tell a better story?
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.980]   Why didn't you get a better hook?"
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.660]   I'm still working on those things, and I will be working on those things for the rest of
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.060]   my career.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.660]   I'm not working on the tech so much anymore.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.760]   The tech is easy to hire.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.080]   You can hire the tech, Don.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.020]   You can't hire the skills.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.460]   So focus on the broadcast skills.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:40.940]   So tired of reading tutorials and whatnot of how to plug in a microphone and how to
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.940]   set up an RSS feed when that stuff is so easily solved today.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:51.540]   And when I started, I couldn't find a good instruction on how to do great interviews.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.660]   That was the thing I was struggling with, was how do I create great interviews?
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.540]   I'll talk about some interview tips in a moment, but I didn't know how to...
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.760]   Why aren't people writing articles about how to be a great interviewer?
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.840]   All this stuff about the tech and no one's about how to create great content.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.660]   Focus on your broadcast skills.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:15.220]   The digital media that we have is amazing, and the opportunity for podcasting is incredible,
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.140]   and we're just getting started.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.180]   I very seriously pursued and investigated the idea of taking radical personal finance
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.660]   to the radio waves at the end of last year.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.380]   I may do it in the future.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.820]   I still think there's an opportunity.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.820]   I still think I could do it.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.700]   I still think I would do well at it.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.500]   I'm convinced the timing is not right.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.740]   If it ever is, I don't know, but it's not right now.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.940]   But I seriously consider it.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.620]   Let me give you the finances though.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.100]   In radio, I don't want to go into all the business models, but you can buy airtime.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.340]   It's possible to get airtime without paying for it.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.100]   Some of you can even possibly get your podcast content distributed to the radio for free.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:56.840]   But many times, the way that much of radio is moving is towards the buying of airtime.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.620]   This will depend on the market, depend on the station, depend on the signal.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:06.180]   But I looked into starting a two-hour-a-day show in a local market on an AM station.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.140]   Basically, the net cost for a station with a decent footprint would have been about $6,000
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.220]   a month here in my local market.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.260]   One radio station, $6,000 a month.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:23.900]   My podcast hosting fees for just my podcast hosted with Libsyn total for a show that gets
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.900]   – I don't know.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.780]   I can't remember what it last month was, but somewhere in the north, almost about 200,000
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:33.660]   downloads a month, $60.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.340]   That is incredible when you compare $6,000 to $60, and I could probably reach about the
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.180]   same amount of people.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.920]   That's why digital media is transforming the world.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:51.400]   Because when people can create content with a cost of $60 for hosting fees versus $6,000,
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.360]   it opens up the world.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.260]   So recognize that medium, jump into it, enjoy the low risk and the low financial risk of
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.620]   it, and get busy.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.460]   Next, advice for you.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.620]   Don't follow – when you're setting up a podcast, do me a favor.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.060]   Do not follow the free tutorials that you see online.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.900]   Do not follow the free tutorials on YouTube.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.260]   My opinion, they are wrong.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.180]   It's not that they can't work.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.960]   It's that they're going to not be ideal.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.740]   Very simplistically, I won't hammer this point.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.980]   It's a very unpopular point in the podcasting space.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:30.540]   But when I set up Radical Personal Finance, I set up the show with a – get a little
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   geeky.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.300]   If you're not a techie, just tune out for about three minutes and we'll be done with
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.300]   this.
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.580]   But what I did was I set up a WordPress site and I signed up with Libsyn for my podcast
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:45.620]   hosting service, set up a WordPress site, set up my RSS feed through the site, was hosting
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.020]   the files on the site.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.020]   Everything broke.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.540]   One of the most difficult days in podcasting for me was in November of 2014.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.580]   I think it was episode 96 to 97, 98, something like that, right before I was getting ready
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.140]   to launch a membership site.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:10.380]   I wound up making my WordPress site broke because a WordPress plugin broke my feed,
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.180]   took the podcast down, and then I went through the process of trying to adjust that.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:19.100]   I made a mistake in fixing it and I wound up deleting all of my iTunes subscribers.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.780]   I sent all of my iTunes subscribers right before I'm launching my big membership site
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.540]   to an empty dead feed.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.140]   That problem plagued me still to this day.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:32.220]   There's still today two listings in Stitcher for Radical Personal Finance because of my
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.060]   mistake that I had made.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.940]   My tech guy is taking care of that at this point.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.660]   I'm going to delete the old listing.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.540]   But I've had immeasurable problems.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.620]   In fact, it hasn't even stopped there.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.940]   I watched the free tutorials online.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.860]   I signed up with a Bluehost WordPress thing.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.460]   For a while, Bluehost was terrible.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.060]   I finally switched away from Bluehost.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.060]   I use WP Engine now for my website hosting.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:00.620]   But even still, for the last four or five months, we've thought that we had a new website
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.820]   built and I built a contact form on the site.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.700]   Finally, I was like, "What is wrong?
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   There's something wrong."
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.740]   We had tested the contact form.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.740]   It was working.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.300]   I just figured out this week with my tech guy that for the last four months, I have
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:19.860]   not received a single contact through that contact form as far as listeners, you who
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.300]   are listeners have been putting in messages.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:26.500]   That is extremely upsetting to me because I've worked really hard over the years of
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:30.700]   giving a personal reply to every single note or email that I've gotten.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.580]   I've tried really hard to respond to all the feedback.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.460]   Sometimes I've been weeks and months behind, but I've tried really hard.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.500]   Well, it's an issue with Bluehost.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.160]   So finally, we're fixing it.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   It has been fixed now.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.760]   The contact form is working.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.900]   Since then, all of a sudden, we went from sparse communication, a few emails here and
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.180]   there, to all of a sudden now about five messages a day consistently in the last few days since
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.340]   it's been working, messages that are important.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.500]   Listeners, you who are listening, sending me feedback.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.120]   That's so important to me.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   So it's incredibly frustrating.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:09.540]   I'm a little bitter about how bad the advice I got watching the free tutorials online was.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.140]   I really wish some of the people who've created those would pull them or adjust them and update
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.140]   them.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.700]   It's frustrating to me, but ignore that.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.820]   So here's the deal.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:21.820]   I'll do it at some point.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.260]   I'll do a new thing.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.740]   If you want to start a podcast, here's what you do.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.900]   Go to Libsyn.com, L-I-B-S-Y-N, stands for Liberate a Syndication.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.460]   Contact them, follow all their free tutorials, and do exactly what they say.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:41.100]   I got in touch with them, and I got them to set up, I asked them to be a part of their
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.640]   affiliate program.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.780]   So they're setting up an affiliate code.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.340]   Just use the affiliate code Radical, and they'll give me a commission, and they'll give you
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.380]   a month and a half free basically.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.840]   I'll detail that at another time.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.060]   But just don't follow the free stuff online.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.740]   It has taken me two years to finally get all of that stuff out of my issues.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.860]   So contact the people at Libsyn and just do what they say.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:08.740]   Next, listenership matters, but the size of the listenership is far less important than
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.660]   the right person listening.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.500]   Always remember that.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.340]   The size of the listenership matters, but it's not as important as the right person
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.340]   listening.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.580]   I would rather have 100 people who are the exact appropriate fit for the purpose and
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:30.060]   the vision of my podcast than 100,000 who are not a good fit.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.980]   All goes back to the vision.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.540]   Ignore listenership size.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.900]   I'm sorry that I did a little bit of a marketing hook myself of, "Hey, Radical Personal Finance
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.900]   has 2 million downloads and 300 episodes."
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.460]   In our modern society, we're doing that because we have to do that.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.540]   It's good marketing to kind of get people to pay attention.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:52.420]   My hope is that you'll pay attention to the title, but focus in on connecting with the
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:59.340]   right listenership, keeping your message exactly on your purpose.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:05.740]   Next, you are going to have to learn to develop in media a thick skin.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:12.660]   Media, if you're going to create media, is not like personal interaction.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.060]   In media, you need to stand for something.
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:20.340]   There's a reason you're creating the content you're creating, and you're going to have
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.380]   unpleasant interactions with people because of it.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.460]   You're going to get haters.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:29.220]   Anybody who stands for something, anybody who dares to have an opinion on the subject
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.820]   is going to get haters.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.420]   You need to commit right now, especially if you're at the beginning stage, you're going
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.380]   to develop a thick skin.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:42.780]   You have to recognize there's something that happens in interpersonal media.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.700]   I can't remember somebody ever walking up to my face, putting their finger in my face,
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.840]   getting angry at me and just telling me off.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   Part of it is I get the advantage.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   I'm a big guy.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.980]   Most people don't mess with me, so I get that advantage.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.700]   Maybe some of you don't have that advantage, but people in real life, they don't do that.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.940]   I don't walk into your house, walk into your living room and just say nasty things to you
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:06.940]   and about you.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:11.100]   In media, it's going to happen, so you've got to prepare for it because when it happens,
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.300]   it won't be pleasant, but you'll have to build new skills, and you're going to have to adjust.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:20.580]   Recognize that the relationships that you have with a small minority of people in your
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.300]   audience are not going to be the same as normal relationships in real life.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.660]   People on the internet, for some reason, get a strange joy out of telling you you're stupid.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.660]   Just deal with it.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.780]   That's life.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:37.660]   Don't let that dissuade you from impacting the people who care about your message because
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.980]   what happens is sometimes you'll get some communication.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.920]   Good people, generally, it seems like people that want to say unpleasant things are far
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.740]   more willing to say unpleasant things than the people who want to say positive things,
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.940]   but then you'll start to receive positive interaction.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.980]   You'll say, "Wow, I had no idea that somebody's out there listening to your stuff and their
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.060]   life is being improved from it."
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:03.780]   Develop a thick skin and plan for that now.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.260]   Next, people have asked me, "What's the best means of promotion?"
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:12.180]   My best and really only means of promotion that I've used has been focusing very, very
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.580]   hard on trying to create great content.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.380]   That's been what I've done up till now.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.540]   That was intentional and it was purposeful, but that doesn't mean that other means of
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.180]   promotion aren't important.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.740]   I am working on additional means of marketing.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:34.060]   I'm going to answer some interview, some listener questions at the end, and I'll talk more about
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.780]   that during one of those questions.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.540]   Don't worry about podcaster bragging metrics.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:47.660]   iTunes is important, but it's not as important in real life as it is for impressing your
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.340]   podcasting friends.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:56.480]   Your iTunes ranking is not an indicator of how large your audience is.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.900]   Don't worry about iTunes.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:03.140]   Now, I recognize that it will be tempting and you will do whatever you want to do to
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.140]   check your ranking.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.100]   I can give you the reasons of how iTunes formulas work.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.180]   I've researched it.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.380]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.380]   It's not important.
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.300]   Basically, at this point, I check iTunes rankings once a month, and if somebody tells me about
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.860]   something I try to go and snag a screenshot in case I ever need it.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.300]   But once a month, I check iTunes rankings.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:28.260]   iTunes rankings are not a reliable indicator of how popular your show is or how impactful
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.260]   your show is.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.380]   You should be going for impact, not popularity.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:39.740]   You're not going to be as popular as the Kardashians, but you can have a way bigger impact than
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.220]   they get to have.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.700]   Next, new and noteworthy does not matter.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.100]   There has not been in the history of radical personal finance, we hit all the stuff.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.820]   We hit new and noteworthy, all that stuff.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:58.460]   There's never been a significant spike from anything, including new and noteworthy, including
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.260]   being featured on top lists and all those things.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.780]   I've had one listener who, when I've inquired, "How did you find me?"
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.220]   I had one listener who's ever corresponded with me and said, "Oh, I saw your show in
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.220]   new and noteworthy."
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.220]   One.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:14.780]   Now, I'm sure there's more than that, but only one person has ever told me that.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.380]   Don't worry about new and noteworthy.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.420]   Focus on content.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.620]   Another little just thing, iTunes reviews don't really matter.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.660]   They don't affect the rankings.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.780]   They just don't really matter all that much.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:31.900]   In the beginning on radical personal finance, I've tried to focus on asking people for
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.220]   reviews, asking people for reviews.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.220]   I thought it was important.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.500]   That's what I thought at the time.
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.900]   In retrospect, it really doesn't matter that much.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:42.060]   They do matter a little bit in that when somebody's looking at your show, if they can see that
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.980]   you have more reviews, they're likely to say, "Okay, let me check this out."
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.580]   So they matter a little bit, but they don't matter that much.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.940]   That said, of course, any listeners who want to review the show, I'm happy to review it,
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.940]   be happy to have it.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:54.940]   It's fine.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:55.940]   I'm thankful to have it.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:56.940]   But they don't matter that much.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.540]   So don't worry about that.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.100]   I'm trying to stress, sorry, for new podcasters.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.360]   Focus on creating great stuff.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.380]   What I love about iTunes reviews is I love that it gives the audience a voice.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.860]   For that reason, you should support iTunes reviews.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.260]   One of the most incredible things we have is we have the ability, people have the ability
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:19.620]   to exercise their rights of free speech and make public commentary on what you're doing.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.620]   I love that.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.420]   I love that people have the opportunity.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:27.060]   I love that my listeners can go into iTunes and they can say they love my show, and I
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.460]   love that they can go in and say that they hate it.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:34.900]   Now, of course, it's not particularly pleasant to read the negative iTunes reviews, but how
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.740]   wonderful that they have the opportunity to do that.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.820]   This is what's so amazing about 2016, that people can do that.
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.660]   It's awesome.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.900]   So don't worry about all the podcaster bragging metrics.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.260]   Focus on meeting the needs of your audience.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.820]   You will not please everyone.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:03.400]   So make sure that you're first pleasing yourself in the sense that you are focused on delivering
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.260]   the content that you want to deliver for the reasons you want to deliver it, and decide
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:12.780]   now to be content with the process of letting people self-select.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:17.680]   You have to be content for your audience to self-select.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.180]   You have to have a message that's important to you for reasons that you care about, and
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:28.300]   then sit back and wait and let the appropriate audience find you.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.220]   Not everybody is going to like you.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.020]   Remember that the most popular people are also the most hated people.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.860]   How many enemies does President Barack Obama have?
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.720]   How many friends does he have?
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:47.660]   So recognize that you will not please everyone, but you will over time attract to your content,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.640]   the audience that most benefits from it.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:59.200]   So decide now to not let yourself be dissuaded from your message and your content simply
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.900]   because your audience is going through a process of self-selection.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.640]   You will not win the popularity contest.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.380]   When Shaquille O'Neal can start a podcast, you don't have any possibility of competing
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.380]   in that market.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.260]   So don't worry about popularity.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:19.940]   Worry about impact, worry about reasons, and choose an area where you can compete.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.260]   Choose to compete on content.
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.320]   Choose to compete on knowledge.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.580]   Choose to compete on your style, on your voice, or on a niche.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.780]   But don't worry about popularity.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.780]   Little tip, I think interview shows are becoming oversaturated.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:41.260]   So if you are running an interview show or if you want to start an interview show, handle
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.780]   them carefully.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.900]   I'll just say handle them carefully.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.020]   But if you're going to do interviews, choose them carefully.
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:54.180]   And this is one of the most challenging things that I face with radical personal finances,
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.900]   trying to figure out how to select the interviews.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.700]   I have things I'm trying to accomplish, but I don't want to just have interviews that
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   I agree with.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.300]   I don't want to just have interviews that I disagree with.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.880]   It's really, really challenging.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.740]   But recognize that you are the editor of your interviews.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.500]   You are the gatekeeper.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.220]   So the question that I try to ask myself, and this is one of the things I'm personally
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:18.180]   struggling with the most in radical personal finances, does this interview serve the needs
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.300]   of my audience?
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.340]   Does this interview fulfill the vision of my show?
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.540]   Very difficult to know if it does or not.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.180]   So be careful doing interview shows.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:34.140]   Interview shows are the easiest show to do, in my opinion.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:38.040]   Easiest shows to do in order of, remember I talked about the four types of shows?
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.300]   The easiest one is an interview show.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.460]   Second easiest is a co-hosted show.
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.900]   Third easiest is a solo show.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:51.980]   And the fourth, like the most difficult, is these audio works of art.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.940]   And also in range of popularity, I'm convinced the audio works of art are probably the most
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.660]   popular than the solo shows, than co-hosted shows.
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.060]   I can't prove that.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.980]   But the audio works of art certainly are the most popular.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.340]   Interview shows, be careful.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.300]   Don't just try to do an interview show unless that specifically fulfills the purpose that
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.940]   you've selected for your show.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.020]   Couple of ideas on interviewing.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.780]   Here's what I've learned.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.800]   Interview skills are difficult to learn.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.620]   And the best way I've been trying to learn them is simply through practice.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:24.060]   And I try to practice the interview and then go and listen to it and see how did I do.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.860]   Would I have been interested in that?
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:32.100]   At this point, what I have learned to do is to interview people that I'm interested in,
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.540]   interview people who have a story that I'm interested in.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.220]   And simply look for the story that I care about.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:42.740]   I've learned to just focus on listening and just trying to follow my interests.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.060]   I have an advantage in that I'm naturally interested in many subjects.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.740]   There's almost nothing you can talk to me about that I can't find an interest in.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.320]   So I have that advantage from an interview perspective that I'm going to be interested
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   in that.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.540]   But I just try to listen and I try to follow the interesting story.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.620]   That's the best thing I've come up with.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.580]   I've found personally interviewing authors of books is very difficult for me.
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:09.460]   And what I more and more am trying to do is just simply if I'm going to interview an author,
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.020]   I try not to read the book first.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:17.260]   Because often when I read the book, I want to get the author to go through the book.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.660]   And authors just don't seem to want to talk about their books in the sense that they want
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.220]   to hold things back.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:28.260]   So what I've learned to do is not read someone's book if I want to interview them.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.020]   That's hard because every time I do it, I always regret it.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.260]   I think, "Oh, that's not very interesting."
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.180]   Next interview tip for you is listen carefully to the other person.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.260]   So easy to let our minds wander.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.820]   It's so easy to focus on where you're trying to take them.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.180]   And you miss out if you're not listening to them.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.560]   You miss out on the little gems.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:51.180]   So I try to listen carefully to the other person and actually respond to what they're
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.740]   saying and not just ask the next question.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.900]   And then again, go and listen to your interviews.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.740]   Let's talk a little bit about numbers.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.740]   Understand how to interpret the numbers of podcasts.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:08.180]   For example, when I say I've had 2 million downloads, you should recognize first, I haven't
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:14.180]   necessarily had somebody listen to 2 million episodes or to somebody listen to...
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.060]   I haven't had 2 million people listen to the show.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:22.020]   What 2 million downloads means is that 2 million times my audio file has been played from some
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.020]   source.
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.940]   But that doesn't know whether it's been played for five seconds or for somebody listened
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.060]   to a three-hour show that I made.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.500]   So you should first be suspicious of big numbers.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:36.660]   Second, you should recognize that many podcasters artificially inflate their numbers through
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.820]   some different means that are available.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.980]   You can do all kinds of things.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.980]   You can buy...
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:48.100]   I mean, the one that's all the big scandal that many shows do is they call Twitter bombing.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.940]   You put your episode out there and you just try to get people to click the link, click
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.180]   the play, and that adds to your download numbers.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:57.140]   So you should be suspicious of numbers when people share numbers.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.900]   Don't trust anybody with their numbers.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.300]   Just assume everyone's always lying.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.420]   That'll help you to feel a little bit better by recognizing that.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.420]   So first, recognize that when I say a big number, like a total downloads, that just
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.140]   means 2 million times an audio file was played.
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:17.280]   Next, you should divide the number of audio files based upon the number of episodes.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.860]   So this is the 300th episode.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:24.180]   If I say 2 million, you should divide 2 million by 299.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:27.260]   And all of a sudden now, you recognize, "Oh, well, this is..."
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.160]   I don't remember what that number is, but this is not so many.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.620]   That's not 100,000 people listening to Joshua's show.
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.740]   That is a few thousand.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.780]   That's a number, and you can divide that very carefully, and that'll help you.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:41.580]   So understand how to interpret the numbers of podcasting, and if you're intimidated or
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:47.820]   attracted by big numbers, recognize that you need to filter those through some knowledge.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:52.100]   The biggest mistakes that I've made in my podcasting journey are with my marketing,
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.300]   my back-end marketing.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:52:00.640]   And this is the major focus for me at this point in time, is to improve the marketing
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   of my show.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.120]   Now, in the beginning, I made a specific...
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:09.160]   I'm not angry at myself for making those mistakes, because I made a conscious decision, "Joshua,
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.840]   you don't have the capacity for that right now.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.120]   Focus on your plan.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:16.440]   Focus on building good content, and then as you build more capacity, you'll be able to
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.840]   go back and fix those things."
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.120]   So building the back-end business is my number one thing right now.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.800]   That's one thing that, as soon as possible, you should be focusing on building the back-end
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   of the business.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.620]   If you're not familiar with those terms, every business has a front-end and a back-end.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.100]   The front-end is the product that you buy up front.
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:38.260]   The back-end is all the products that you buy after the initial sale.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:43.820]   So if you look at... and this is where many people fall apart, is many businesses are
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.580]   broken because they only offer front-end products.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.140]   This is where Radical Personal Finance is.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.020]   I only have two front-end products at the moment.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:52.960]   I have a Patreon campaign, where listeners support my show.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.620]   Thank you to those of you who do.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.160]   And number two is I have advertising.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.780]   Those are my only two aspects of my front-end business.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.020]   Those are the least profitable parts of the business, and I need to focus on the back-end
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:06.340]   business, which is building more products, building books, building courses, building
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.060]   videos, building seminars, building all these products.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.220]   That's where all the profit is.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:15.300]   And so that's where I'm 100% focused now, and you should apply the same thing to your
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.360]   business.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:21.820]   Get the front-end good, and then get the back-end great.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:28.340]   Big lesson, do not betray your trust or your integrity in the process of building your
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.340]   show.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.340]   I don't think it's...
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.820]   I was going to make a definite statement.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.820]   I'll just say it.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.020]   You can't lie to your audience.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.780]   You've got to be you through and through, because when you're on a microphone, you can't
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.500]   remember what you said 100 episodes ago.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:45.700]   So if you're lying, you're making stuff up, if you're inconsistent with your personality,
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.340]   you're trying to be somebody that you're not, you're not going to remember who you were
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.340]   100 episodes ago.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.520]   I can't remember yesterday's show.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:56.260]   So you've got to decide that you're okay with being you.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.300]   That's scary, because people might not accept you.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:04.160]   It hurts when people don't accept you for being you, but you've got to do that.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.420]   Don't lie to your audience, and don't ever betray your integrity, because if you do,
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:09.420]   you'll never get it back.
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.460]   I'm going to skip ways to monetize the podcast right now.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.140]   That was probably the most biggest question.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.980]   That was the next lesson here, but let's talk about my production flow.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:23.600]   So at this point in time, I do a podcast in two different ways.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.420]   Number one, at home, I record.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.420]   I have a mixer.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:33.540]   I have a microphone, and I record into a hard disk audio recorder.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:38.700]   So I use an old iPhone with Boss Jock on it for my audio carts.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.880]   That's where I play the show music and things like that.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   So I play that.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.920]   I have plugged that into the mixer.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.300]   I have Skype set up with a mix minus on my PC.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:49.300]   I have a laptop.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:54.880]   I use a USB iMic thing that gives me the outputs from my laptop that makes it possible for
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.340]   me to do my mix minus pretty easily.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.980]   And then I put that onto an audio SD card.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:04.420]   I record all of my solo shows in one take with no editing.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:09.300]   I made the decision early on that I wasn't going to edit, simply because I wanted my
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:12.440]   point of differentiation, my unique selling proposition.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:17.060]   My point of differentiation was more content and deeper content.
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.440]   Now that has hurt me.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:24.520]   The biggest theme of my iTunes reviews, if you go read my iTunes reviews, the constant
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:30.200]   theme "Joshua rambles and his shows are too long."
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.800]   Those reviews are accurate.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:35.160]   I rambled and my shows are too long.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.300]   I was not unaware of that.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.200]   I didn't have the ability to do it better.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   And so people would say, "Well, it's better if you edit."
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.680]   Well, maybe so.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.520]   But what I was looking for at that time was I was looking for more content and I could
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.380]   deal with bad editing.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.720]   If the content was good, I could just listen to a show at 2x or just skip forward when
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   I was ready.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.620]   And so I figured, well, my audio has to do the same thing.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:56.620]   So I made a decision.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.120]   I'm not going to edit.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:01.600]   What I'm going to focus on doing is trying to create more content.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.280]   And I'm going to build the skills.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.520]   So I made that decision.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.520]   That was why I bought the mixer and did all of that.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.760]   That I just go straight to the hard drive and it's done.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   When it's done, it's done.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.680]   So I do hit pause on my little recorder sometimes, gather my thoughts.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.560]   I do restart.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.160]   Sometimes I'll have to give two or three starts to the show to get the intros how I want them.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.360]   I make them up off the top of my head.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.360]   Everything is off the top of my head except for my outline.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:31.000]   So I record directly into the hard disk.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   I edit it.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   I export it.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.820]   At this point in time, I don't know how to run audio editing software.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.520]   The only thing I know to do, I use Audacity.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.880]   The only thing I know how to do is to cut out a slice out a section.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:47.120]   And I use that for splicing together interview shows with an intro and an outro.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.480]   And then if somebody curses on my show, I try to go and snip that out.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.960]   I try to keep it obvious.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.240]   I don't play a beat, but I try to keep it obvious that they cursed on my show.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.320]   But I try to pull out the actual profanity.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.360]   I don't want profanity on my show.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.920]   So I do try to do that.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.120]   So that's the only thing I know how to do is to cut out things and then to cut together
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.920]   a lot of times when Skype misses up.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   The rest of it, I use a service called Auphonic.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.960]   I just upload my WAV file into Auphonic.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.640]   Auphonic processes my file.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.120]   It exports it as an MP3.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.320]   I take that MP3, I upload it in Ellipson, and I publish it.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.080]   I'll talk about my publishing process in a moment.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.440]   So that's the way I record when I'm at home.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.560]   The other way I record is right now I'm sitting here with my iPhone.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.640]   I use BossJock.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.680]   I have learned to do things on my iPhone.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:37.800]   My podcast, Encouraging Christian Fathers, every single episode is recorded, edited,
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.560]   and published exclusively from my iPhone.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.080]   I don't ever put those files onto a computer.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.240]   And I do that because it's a lot easier.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:49.720]   If I had known about the workflow that I have there before, I never would have bought the
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   mixer.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.720]   I never would have done that stuff.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.440]   I would have just done it on my phone the whole way through.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.360]   It works really, really well.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.480]   I'll give you a resource for that in a moment.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.840]   So I have two different setups that I do.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.960]   Let's talk about my publishing process for shows at home.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.380]   In the past, I've done all this myself.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:11.720]   But at this point with Radical Personal Finance, the thing that drains me personally, drains
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:15.000]   my creativity and sucks all my energy is doing tech stuff.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.440]   I'm a creative person when it comes to creating content, and I can't stand doing the tech
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   stuff.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.680]   So at this point, I've built a workflow where I take my audio file.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.680]   I work in Libsyn.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.120]   I publish to Libsyn my audio file.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.120]   I write the headline.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:35.400]   Excuse me, I write the title of the show, and I write a little blurb for it.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.400]   Show notes.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.920]   People have a lot of opinions on show notes.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.280]   They say, "Oh, you should have lots of show notes."
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.080]   Show notes drain me.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:47.440]   Usually when I finish writing a show, I am absolutely physically exhausted.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.360]   And so I just put a lot of energy into the show, and I want to publish it, and I can't
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.460]   face the thought of writing show notes.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:58.760]   So what I have chosen to do is to write show notes in the form of just a short little teaser,
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.120]   basically the equivalent of a Facebook post.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.960]   They're usually about 700 words, and here's a little teaser.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.920]   Here's why you should listen to it, because I'm just so drained I can't face it.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.280]   And if I spend more time doing show notes, it would take me an entire day to do show
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.580]   notes the way I'd like to do them, and there'd be one less episode that I could do.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.820]   And I think my audience wants more episodes and fewer show notes.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.680]   So that's the decision that I have made.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.920]   So I write the show notes in Libsyn.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.160]   I click publish.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:26.720]   What happens when I do that is the way Libsyn publishing works is it goes to all my different
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   destinations.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.080]   It goes to my RSS feed, which goes into iTunes.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.800]   That goes into, it gets published to my apps.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.720]   It gets published everywhere to all these different destinations all at one shot.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:42.800]   Then that file, I have a, the file's published to the RSS feed.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:48.000]   I have a graphic designer who I've hired who does all of my show artwork.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.320]   So that file goes into the RSS feed.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:56.760]   When the RSS feed picks it up, I have an IFTTT formula where once the RSS feed picks it up,
[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.040]   it sends it into a service I use called Glip, G-L-I-P.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.720]   And that's where I connect with my web developer and my graphic designer.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:12.120]   And so it goes into the, it goes right into the Glip channel that we use to interact on
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   that.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.960]   Once it goes there, we create a task.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:21.420]   The graphic designer goes ahead and creates an image.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.420]   Usually takes her, because she works on it just part time, it usually takes a couple
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.700]   days for the image to be created.
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.280]   And then once that image is created, we go back in.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.520]   My web developer uploads that, a square image into Libsyn.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.460]   And that's the image that gets shared through to my social channels from the Libsyn social
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.000]   sharing functions.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.180]   And then we create a banner for the website.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:46.120]   And then my web developer takes the file, puts it onto the website with the banner.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.400]   And at that point in time, then it goes out into the email distribution list.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.140]   Now that's a little bit techie geeky complicated, but what that does, and I've worked hard to
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:58.200]   get myself out of that process, even especially recently, is now I'm out of that process.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.320]   And that helps me to retain my sanity so I can reserve my creative energy for writing
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.340]   or for creating the products and the seminars and the things that I'm working on.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.280]   So that's been a big help to me.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.940]   What it naturally results in is there's always about a two to four day delay of publishing
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.320]   of shows on the website.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.360]   So if you're a normal listener to the show and you're not interested in all this podcast
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:23.560]   stuff, what I would recommend is make sure you're subscribed to the show, either in iTunes
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.000]   or on my app, and you'll always get the show the fastest that way.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.100]   It won't show up on the website until a couple days later.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:34.120]   But a little trick, if you ever want to listen to it on the website, go to the archives page
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.080]   and that player that's at the top of the archives page, that player will have the show because
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.200]   it picks it up from the RSS feed.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:47.400]   So that's my production flow, how I do it from my home office.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.440]   When I'm away or if I'm using my iPhone, what I do is I record in BossJock, I record in
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.360]   one shot, that's what I'm doing right now.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.760]   When I finish this show, I'll export a wave file, I use Auphonic, there's an Auphonic
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:06.140]   app on my phone, I move it to Auphonic, Auphonic processes it and then I use the Auphonic distribution
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.920]   feature to send the file over directly over to Libsyn.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.280]   And there are three different options of ways to do it, but the file shows up on Libsyn
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.760]   and with that file there on Libsyn, I can go ahead and publish it, I write a quick thing
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.460]   on my phone and publish it just in the normal way.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.960]   So that's the process there.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:30.280]   The best resources for you on podcast publishing is go to Libsyn and get their tutorials, free
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.800]   tutorials, do what they say in their tutorials.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.720]   If you want to sign up for a Libsyn account, use the coupon code Radical.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.440]   I need to check with Robert Libsyn to make sure that was set up.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.680]   I told him, I asked him for a coupon code.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.840]   So I get a little commission for that, great, thank you, and it gets you a one month free
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.840]   offer.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.680]   Use coupon code Radical and follow their stuff.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:54.520]   The second one is the best resource for publishing, recording and publishing from your phone is
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.200]   a website called themobilepro.net.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.600]   That's a guy named Sean Smith.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.240]   I've become friends with him because you'll see an endorsement from me, a testimonial
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.560]   from me right on his site.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.440]   I've become friends with him because once I saw his system, it convinced me how to do
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440]   it.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440]   So I use his systems.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.280]   I use the Fancy one when I'm doing interviews.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.720]   The one I do with my dad, we sit down, we have two SM7, I have two SM7Bs that I sit
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.680]   down, we sit down across the table, put that stuff right through an ART Dual Pre into the
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.400]   iPhone and do the whole show together like that.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.600]   Right now, this show, I travel with an ATR2100, sorry, it's actually an AT2005 because it
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:36.000]   was cheaper when I bought it, into a USB cable right into the phone and that's what I'm working
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.640]   with right now.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.040]   And so he's the one who taught me that whole flow.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.400]   I set up at some point in the past an affiliate thing.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.520]   I'll go and find it when I get back to the office and I'll link it in the show notes
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.840]   today and if you want to buy his guide, his $97 video guide, you can get a free ebook
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.740]   showing you how to set up the systems.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:56.160]   If you want to buy his guide, you can feel free to use my affiliate link and I'll get
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.160]   a commission for that.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   So cool.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160]   Awesome.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   All right.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160]   That's enough tech, man.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   I've never done that much tech.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   So I'm not stupid when it comes to tech.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   I do my homework on things.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.240]   I just don't like talking about it.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.400]   Two quick final lessons and I'm going to answer some questions from listeners and then we'll
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.400]   be done.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.200]   And I know this is, I just wanted to get these lessons out.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.240]   This is just Joshua's.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.720]   If we were sitting down, I'm giving you podcasting advice.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.920]   Here's what I've learned.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.800]   I'm not trying to create a masterpiece here.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.100]   You should look carefully, oh sorry, three things.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:32.740]   You should look carefully at the negative feedback that you get.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:39.120]   Be careful that you don't associate you with your work in a personal way.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.200]   We all have a tendency to hold our creative work very close to our heart.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.980]   It's an expression of us.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:49.920]   And so what happens then is when you receive negative feedback on it or negative opinions
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.040]   of it, negative reviews, things like that, it's easy to hurt.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.440]   I don't know how to make it not hurt at all.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.120]   I certainly hurt a little bit when my stuff is criticized, but I'm convinced it's important
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.960]   to recognize that you shouldn't hold your work that way.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.000]   Rather, you should hold your work at arm's length and say, "This is not me.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   This is just my work.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.760]   I've created this piece of work," and hold it out there and try to get it away from you
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.240]   where you don't get so associated and wrapped up with it where you can't read the negative
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.280]   feedback.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.520]   You should look for the negative feedback as if it's sincere, if it will help you get
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.520]   better.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:27.000]   So read the negative reviews and try to get help, let them fuel you to help you get better.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.840]   Now you're going to get people that are going to just say things about you.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   Our society, we have a disease of the ad hominem attack where people just feel better by attacking
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.880]   the person instead of attacking the person's ideas.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   Ignore all that stuff.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.480]   Recognize it's a logical fallacy.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.480]   Just ignore it.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.640]   You can know if you get an email or a voicemail or a comment or whatever, or someone just
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.120]   says, "I can't believe you're so stupid, blah, blah, blah," just hit delete or hit approve.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.000]   I approve them and I just move on with my day.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.320]   But when you get someone who sincerely says, "I appreciate your message, but here's how
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.780]   it could get better," that's what you need to know what to work on.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.640]   So I need my negative reviews.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.720]   I need the views to say that I'm rambling.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.320]   Those are the things that have fueled me to help me get better.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320]   So in the beginning, I didn't do extensive outlines.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.720]   I got all these rambling reviews, rambling, rambling, rambling, blah, blah, blah.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   Okay, fine.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.120]   I got the point loud and clear.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.460]   So I said, "I got to fix this."
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.760]   So now I try to do more careful outlines.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:31.080]   I use personally, I use a website called WorkFlowy, W-O-R-K-F-L-O-W-Y, WorkFlowy.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.720]   It's an outlining program and I find it to be very intuitive for me.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.720]   Works on my phone.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.280]   As I do this right now, I'm literally reading.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.960]   I have my WorkFlowy app open on my phone and I have Boss Jock running in the background
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.680]   recording this episode and it allows me to move things around, to try to get an order
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.760]   and just, it's an effective way for me to work in bullet points.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.720]   And then once I have the bullet point, it reminds me of the thought and hopefully keeps
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.720]   me focused on I wanted to express this bullet point.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:04.860]   So look for the negative feedback and just recognize you are not your work.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.940]   You're going to hate your early work.
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:14.540]   So be strong and do it and recognize that anything worth doing well is worth doing poorly
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:18.020]   at first.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:23.320]   How good of a walker and runner is your average one-year-old child?
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.820]   They're not very good.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:31.620]   But that same one-year-old child with lots of practice and lots of falls is going to
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620]   get better.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.700]   They're going to become one day a smooth and elegant runner.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:41.000]   So the key is for us to focus on just the process of improving and not so much on the
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.380]   early outcome.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:45.900]   And if you get started as a producer, find a safe way to do it, you'll go through this
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.900]   process.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.700]   And so I want you to go and read my negative reviews.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:56.500]   I want you to go and see how difficult, how bad some of my early episodes were and then
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:01.260]   do that same thing because everything worth doing well, worth doing is worth doing poorly
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.260]   at first.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:12.100]   One of the biggest lies that people swallow is that you have to be good at something in
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.100]   the beginning.
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.100]   You're not going to be good at something in the beginning.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:18.300]   As long as you're improving, you can be satisfied with your work.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.060]   Last bullet point, I missed this a little bit earlier.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.140]   Transcripts.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.280]   Everyone says they want transcripts.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.280]   No one wants to pay for it.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:29.220]   I'm in the process right now, if we're doing a test, 10 of my episodes are being transcribed
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.220]   and we're doing a little test.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.780]   I'm not going to tell you which ones because we're doing an SEO test to see if they make
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:35.380]   an impact on transcriptions.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:39.300]   I'll talk about that in the future.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.940]   But transcripts are expensive and I just wasn't willing to spend the money on them.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.740]   I have a couple of quick questions from listeners.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.780]   I put this show topic out there in some social forums and I want to answer some questions.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.100]   Number one, Joshua, what is your top way to promote your show?
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.340]   For me, the number one thing I've focused on in promoting my show has been trying to
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:01.860]   create the best content that I'm capable of doing it and hoping that it would be useful
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.020]   to people out there in my listening audience and hoping that my listening audience, out
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:10.020]   of appreciation for the good content, would share it with others.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.540]   That's been what I focused on.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:15.200]   That was my top, that has been and still is my top way.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.160]   My favorite thing that I see is when I, if I go and look in a finance forum or something
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.900]   like that and somebody says, "Oh, Joshua Sheets at Radical Personal Finance created a show
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.900]   on this topic.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.220]   You'll find it to be useful."
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.220]   That's what I want to see.
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.980]   That's what I love to see.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:40.220]   The other useful way is I am very well located with, real quick, on the quality.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.580]   If you focus on quality, your quality will be found out and then people will promote
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.580]   your stuff for you.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.820]   They'll include you on the top 10 list.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:51.260]   They'll include you on, hey, five great finance podcasts, things like that.
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.380]   If you don't focus on quality and you're always focused on promoting a bad product, you're
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.740]   never going to get included on that stuff.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:58.740]   That stuff scales.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:04.700]   You can't write a marketing blog post every day, but if you just focus on creating something
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:10.340]   good and be patient, then it's scalable when people promote your stuff for you.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.980]   Let other people promote your stuff for you.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:15.660]   Don't go necessarily focus first on promoting it yourself.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:20.580]   That said, a couple of tips and things that have been helpful to me to promote the show.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:26.060]   In addition to good content, I'm well positioned for the keyword personal finance.
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:30.140]   I chose only one keyword, iTunes personal finance.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.660]   That's what I was looking for, radical personal finance.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:35.900]   It's good SEO in the title of my website.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:40.940]   It's good optimization in iTunes, personal finance.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.020]   My show title is very descriptive.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.500]   I didn't have a name brand.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.620]   I didn't have a platform.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.860]   I couldn't start the Joshua Sheets show and expect people to find it.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:55.820]   No one knew who Joshua Sheets was, so I started the radical personal finance show.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.860]   I'm going to do that likewise.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:03.460]   Next thing of promotion is it is useful to do some interviews, interviews with authors.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.340]   Also interview to review books.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.460]   The third episode of the show, I reviewed early retirement extreme and that was the
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.460]   first bump.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:12.340]   What happened was I reviewed early retirement extreme.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.540]   I love that personal finance book.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:19.100]   Then when I did the link back, I did a track back to Jacob Lundfisker's website and he
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.100]   put it on his website.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.660]   All of a sudden, I opened up my stats one morning.
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.460]   This was back when I was checking them every day.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:31.820]   I opened up the stats and all of a sudden, I saw, wow, I think it went from 30 downloads
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.180]   a day to 300 downloads a day.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.100]   It's like, oh, wow.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.180]   Even going forward in the future, one of the things that I am going to do with the radical
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:45.020]   personal finance content, I'm going to be reviewing a lot of books, partly because I
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:49.580]   am convinced it's an effective way for me to – no, mostly because I'm convinced it's
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:53.480]   an effective way for me to provide useful content to my audience.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.500]   My audience is choosing to consume content in a verbal format where they often don't
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.820]   have the time to read.
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.260]   One way I can serve my audience is I can read the books.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:05.740]   I can pull the key ideas and I can take what would take them hours to read and I can say,
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:10.900]   here are the key major aspects of this book that you need to find.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.740]   However, that's the major reason.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.280]   A minor reason is it will help me with the popularity of radical personal finance.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.220]   By doing a book review, people who are searching for that book will find my book review.
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.460]   Those authors will be aware of me.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.460]   They'll become aware of them.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.820]   Some of them will listen to the show and they'll say, "Hey, I like this.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:28.820]   This is good."
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:31.340]   They'll promote it, etc., etc., etc.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.780]   Interacting with authors and people who have a platform, doing an interview is nice.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.320]   Sometimes people will tweet out an interview and some of that person's fans will come and
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.540]   listen to your show, guest posting, all that stuff that you hear about in all the podcast
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:44.540]   forums.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.140]   The key thing that I've just focused on is trying to create great stuff and letting other
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.340]   people promote it for me.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.700]   Number two, do I monetize and if so, how?
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:53.940]   Yes, I have two ways.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.300]   I have some ads.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:13:01.300]   Some of those ads are affiliate links where I get a commission on them, on if somebody
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.060]   uses my referral link.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:10.380]   Some of the ads are based upon CPM ads where I set out a flat contract with people.
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.420]   So I do monetize with ads.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.540]   I didn't want to monetize with ads.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:20.580]   I started focusing on Patreon, but I had real problems with, and I have about 200, I think
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.660]   235, 240 people who support the show on Patreon.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.820]   It comes out to the tune of about $2,000 a month right now.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:29.820]   There's a whole story.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.820]   I don't want to get into that.
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.900]   I've struggled with how to position that.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:37.340]   I've even struggled in the last few months with Patreon, trying to figure out.
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.900]   I felt like I wasn't delivering everything that I wanted to deliver.
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.460]   That's been the story of my life, is not being able to deliver on the stuff I want to deliver.
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.220]   So even just in the last couple of days, we've radically simplified the Patreon campaign.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:52.020]   And now I'm confident that I've got a much better fit of something I can deliver.
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.140]   And so I'm going to be working on that.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:58.180]   And my hope is that the audience will step forward and many more will support the show
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.780]   on Patreon based upon the bonuses that I'm offering and the value that I'm offering.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:05.620]   And that will allow me, my intention is I want to remove the advertising from the show.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:10.820]   But at this point, I'm focused very much on creating backend products, products that are
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.500]   going to solve the problems that my audience is asking me.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.780]   In the beginning, I thought I could give everything away on the show for free.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.780]   And I still do.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.900]   I give, and I intend, I'm going to do a thousand episodes.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:24.420]   Whether I'll do it after a thousand, probably, but I'm not committed to it.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:25.420]   But I'm still going to do a thousand episodes.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:30.040]   And I think in a thousand episodes, I'm going to be able to articulate a pretty comprehensive
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.540]   curriculum that will help people for free.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.860]   And I feel really, I love doing that.
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.380]   I really feel good about that.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:40.180]   I've gotten a little bit lost over episodes, basically 200 or 300 of content.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.220]   I've struggled a little bit now.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.580]   I'm feeling much better.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.860]   I've got a clearer outline of the topics I'm covering.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.500]   I'm much more intentional about my content.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.580]   So I know what I'm doing going forward, and I'm still going to deliver the content.
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:57.620]   But what I've realized though, is that the podcast is not the best format for me to answer
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.500]   somebody's specific question.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:04.380]   And so I have to create products that are really, really valuable products, where when
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.860]   people have a specific question, my product is the perfect fit.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.260]   And that's what I'm going to do in the future.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:12.340]   And that's the way that you should monetize most shows.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.020]   Not all shows, but most shows.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:16.660]   Not every show has to be monetized directly.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.660]   Next question.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.380]   How do I flesh out a topic when I'm a little short on ideas?
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.420]   I'm not short on ideas.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:27.940]   What I'm short on is the time to do an idea justice.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.620]   I have hundreds of ideas.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:39.940]   First, when I set out to do the show, I intentionally chose a format that would help me to be able
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:42.260]   to articulate, to have a plan.
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.460]   You have to have a game plan to run.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.600]   If you just sit down and you don't have an outline to work with, it's really hard.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.980]   So I decided on Mondays, I was going to do a personal finance show.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.860]   On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I was going to do an interview show.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:55.500]   On Wednesdays, I would do a deep dive of financial planning.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.300]   On Fridays, I would do Q&A.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:02.460]   So the only actual topics that I needed in that situation were Mondays and Wednesdays.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:07.060]   But Wednesdays were easy because I set out to teach through the CFP curriculum.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.220]   I just took the curriculum and that became my outline.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.900]   Those are the most difficult shows for me to create because they're very time consuming,
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.340]   which is why they've been sparse recently.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.300]   I've been busy and I haven't been able to get them done.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.500]   I'm not giving up on them.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:23.660]   I just haven't been able to get them done with the time that I have.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.260]   They're very time consuming, but I don't struggle with ideas on them because I know the outline.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:33.340]   The reason they're time consuming is I have to take the content, distill it from a textbook,
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.260]   which is very wordy, and distill it to the key points for someone who's not trying to
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.540]   sit for the CFP, but someone who just wants the knowledge, a layperson who wants the knowledge.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:48.300]   I work very hard not to plagiarize the textbooks that I have and just read them.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.840]   So I work and I say, "Okay, what's my spin on it?"
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.460]   So I can take their outline.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:56.740]   I usually work from a couple of textbooks laid out and I try to take that and create
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:00.980]   my own outline so I'm not plagiarizing from the textbooks, but I'm getting the key points.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.660]   So those are my Wednesday shows.
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:06.060]   My Monday shows are my personal finance shows and I keep lists of topics.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:09.940]   I use Workflowy and I use Notebooks and I write all these things down.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.380]   My Friday shows are Q&A's.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:15.500]   So every question that I get from every listener goes into a Workflowy list that says Friday
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.260]   Q&A shows and it's the whole text of the question.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.660]   And then I try to go through and answer those as best I can.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:27.060]   A lot of times the answers require a lot of time and a lot of preparation and so those
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.700]   have been difficult to get done as well, but I'm not short on ideas.
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.980]   I would recommend to you if you're short on ideas for your podcast topic, it's probably
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.140]   not what you should podcast about.
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.180]   It's probably not.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:41.140]   Next, how did you get to 2 million downloads?
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:42.780]   Techniques used to draw that many people?
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.780]   Good content.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.500]   I like to believe good content.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.780]   Good content, a little bit of optimization of personal finance, a little bit of popularity
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.740]   and hopefully it's gotten better.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:59.700]   What is different now after getting 2 million downloads compared to when you were only getting
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.700]   a few hundred?
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.700]   What has changed?
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:06.040]   What has changed is that everything else in the business, when I began I had a single
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.420]   minded focus on content and I made a choice to ignore everything else.
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.200]   And so I was able to focus exclusively on creating content.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:19.020]   Now 300 episodes later, I've had to build out all of those things that were ignored.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.100]   I've had to build out the website.
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.500]   I've had to build out the marketing product and I've had to build that stuff out.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:26.140]   And that stuff takes time and I had to build the business.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.540]   So that time takes away from creating the content.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:36.700]   And so I feel like the content I'm creating in some ways is not as good because I'm not
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:40.380]   able to put as much time into it as when I was getting a few hundred.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.340]   So that has been a big change.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.060]   The other major change is when I was only getting a few hundred downloads, I wasn't
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:51.020]   scared to do a show in the sense that if it wasn't very good, I would say, "Okay, I'm
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.020]   learning."
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:57.180]   But now 300 episodes in, speaking very frankly right now, I've worked on this outline and
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.180]   worked on this outline.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:59.180]   I wrote down these lessons.
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.180]   I wrote down these lessons.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.660]   I'm at a conference and I intended to record this yesterday rather than today.
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.140]   And I've worked on it, worked on it, worked on it.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:11.220]   But still I got to the point where it's not quite right, but I've got to ship the show.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.420]   And so I forced myself to do it.
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:18.620]   But as I've gone through this content, about every 10 minutes I've had to fight the urge
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.500]   of hitting stop and canceling this whole recording because I realized, "Oh, I should go back
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:26.580]   and adjust this flow a little bit earlier and this flow a little bit later."
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.580]   And that wasn't good.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:31.020]   And I missed these two points and I feel like the flow wasn't quite right.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:35.500]   I'm not satisfied with the show, but I know I've got to ship the show.
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.020]   And so I've just got to do it.
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.160]   And if it's not great, it's not great.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:45.760]   But what's hard about a show attaining popularity is it's really hard to try to over deliver.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.920]   It's really hard to try to beat what you've done before.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.320]   And it's really intimidating knowing that many more people are going to hear that, and
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.680]   they don't get to hear your good shows.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.140]   They got to hear this show.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:06.460]   So that's what's the worst thing about starting to get popular is often it's much more intimidating.
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.760]   It's intimidating to hit publish.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.560]   I'll be very frank, so I want to encourage you content producers.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:18.040]   I generally am utterly terrified when I hit publish on a show because I'm convinced it's
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:24.040]   terrible and I really only get excited when I get to the next episode and I'm getting
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.720]   ready to do that outline.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.280]   Then I get excited about that outline and that idea.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:34.200]   But generally my mood goes from very excited to by the end of the show it goes down because
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.400]   I think that wasn't very good.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.400]   That wasn't good.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   That wasn't good.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400]   That wasn't good.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   That wasn't good.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.400]   But what I've chosen is podcasting format.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:45.160]   It's one thing if I'm going to present a speech, I'm going to practice that speech multiple
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   times.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   I'm going to deliver it.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.840]   And so I can do those dress rehearsals, but with the podcast I can't justify the time
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.320]   of recording a show four times.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.760]   That's not a good use of my time.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.600]   And so I've got to force myself to publish it.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.680]   And that's really hard.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.240]   It's humbling because you know you're publishing something that you could do better if you
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.800]   did it four more times.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.480]   But if you do it four more times, that was four other shows you could get done or four
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.760]   other things that you could do or more time I could spend playing in the park with my
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.000]   kids.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:25.400]   So there's this balance and this tension there between doing your best versus making the
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.240]   product as good as you're capable of doing if you just kept doing it and doing it and
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.280]   doing it.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.400]   Is there a right move?
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:36.440]   Should I do where I spend an entire week focusing on one episode and try to make it just a masterpiece?
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.000]   If I only did one episode a week, I'm sure I could do an amazing episode if I spent 40
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   hours on it.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.040]   But the time question of it is I don't think it's worth it.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.080]   I think the plan I've taken is better.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.400]   So it's very intimidating once your show gets bigger because you're trying to do better,
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.760]   but I feel worse in many ways.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:58.560]   I know it sounds like an oxymoron because earlier I said I was getting better.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:04.000]   I know that I am better now, but I don't feel better sometimes when I'm in the middle of
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   the show.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.920]   So now I'm thinking to myself, "Joshua, rambling, rambling, rambling.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.520]   You just probably spent about three minutes answering this question, 'Was this valuable
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520]   to the audience?'"
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.400]   And the temptation would be to go back and cut it out.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.760]   That's the pressure that happens as you start to grow and start to change.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:22.800]   What processes do you use now you wish you had implemented when you started?
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.420]   That's the next question.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:34.640]   I wish when I started that Boss Jock was available and I wish I had known about Boss Jock and
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:39.200]   Audio Technica ATR2100 with a USB file into the Boss Jock.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:42.480]   If I had known about this when I started, I never would have bought a mixer.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.000]   I never would have bought all that gear.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.920]   I would have just simply done it on the phone and I would have done this whole publishing
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.640]   process on the phone from the beginning.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:54.040]   I publish more and more episodes of Radical Personal Finance just on the phone because
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:58.680]   I find it easier, simpler than doing all the nonsense on the computer.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.560]   So that's the thing I would change in the process.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.520]   That process would have been useful to me in the beginning.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.920]   Knowing what you know now, what would you have done differently in the first 50 or 100
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.920]   episodes?
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.080]   The only thing I would have done differently in the first 50 or 100 episodes is worked
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.240]   harder on my outlines.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:22.040]   And that was the change I made to try to become less rambly and to become more concise.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.400]   I would have tried to focus on my outlines more.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.480]   In the beginning, I wasn't outlining as carefully and I should have started in the beginning
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.600]   outlining more carefully.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:37.320]   And at this point, I cannot justify the time that it takes me to outline a whole show exactly
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:42.960]   right so I forced myself to do less comprehensive outlines.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:46.840]   But in order just to make the business work the way that I want it to work, I can't put
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.360]   seven hours into preparing a one-hour show every day because it eats up my whole day
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.900]   and I'll have nothing left.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:57.440]   So if I would have done differently in the beginning, I would have made more comprehensive
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.120]   outlines in the beginning which would have helped me to be less rambly, cement those
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:08.040]   skills of staying focused, and then now I would have pulled back on the outlines.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:12.160]   As it is, I feel like I'm 100 episodes behind where I should be.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:17.280]   Another thing that is important to that point of what I would have done differently is in
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.200]   the beginning, I tried to fit too much into one show.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.920]   And that is one thing that limits the benefit of my show.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.840]   Still to this day, I try to fit too much.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.920]   I fit 30 things.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:31.680]   This would have been a better show if I had chosen five instead of 30.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:35.560]   But as it is, it's 30 and I've done questions and now here I am an hour and something into
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   it.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.120]   It's still something I'm trying to simplify, simplify, simplify because I've realized I
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:46.640]   like long and complex, but the majority of people cannot process as much information
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.320]   as I want to get across.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.480]   And so I've got to be aware of that and keep things more concise.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.440]   That is still my biggest challenge.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.920]   If I had to pick one single thing to focus on above all else over for your first 300
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.040]   episodes, what would it be?
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.960]   It would be this.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:11.760]   Ignore the vanity metrics and focus on trying to continue to improve your competence, your
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.520]   skill and your quality as a broadcaster.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.280]   If you can deliver content and focus on just becoming a better broadcaster, focus on the
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.600]   hooks on that.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.600]   I'm studying radio.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.920]   I don't spend any time, I don't read any podcasting blogs, I don't listen to any podcasts about
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.920]   podcasting.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.680]   I'm in the radio world trying to say what do the radio people do?
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.000]   They're the people that we should be studying, not necessarily podcasting.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   Next question.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.920]   I'd love to know what metrics you track to know if your podcast is truly effective as
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.920]   a content marketing tool.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.920]   The answer to that question is Patreon.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.600]   Patreon and ad responses.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.800]   That's it.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.520]   If you're doing this as a business, which was my intention from the beginning, then
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.080]   it's a matter of what revenue.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.800]   I don't care at this point.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:06.000]   iTunes reviews don't pay my rent.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.960]   It's about am I serving people with high quality content and useful things that are impactful
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.520]   in their life such that I can earn their money.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.160]   That's how I view my Patreon campaign.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:23.260]   I'm trying to earn my listeners' support of me financially based upon how effective and
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.420]   helpful am I as that.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:27.760]   How do you convert listeners to email subscribers?
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.040]   I am terrible at that.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.400]   It is one of the biggest weaknesses on my business.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.080]   I'm trying to change it.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.280]   I am changing that.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.280]   It's the biggest weaknesses.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.680]   I'm very bad at converting email subscribers and I've known it's a weakness and for various
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.920]   reasons I've ignored it.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.760]   How do you get useful constructive feedback on your podcast?
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.920]   I just listen and sometimes I just read what people say.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.320]   You always have to online.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.680]   It's very easy to track the stuff.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.960]   People talking about you on Reddit or talking about you on forums.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.440]   The transparency of information is so great because I can read what people are saying
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.980]   when they're not filtered by me.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:09.540]   You have to filter that back through your image and through your perception.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:15.720]   For example, the number one piece of feedback that people talk about on my show, there are
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.360]   probably three major themes that hurt me.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.320]   Number one, too long.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.320]   This is four.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:25.920]   Too long, too rambly, too much religion, too much politics.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.520]   If you were to go and read what I read about the show, you would find those four things
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.480]   are constant themes.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.320]   The problem is how do you balance that with your vision?
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.840]   I'll tell you how I balance it.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   Too long.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   Yes, I agree.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.320]   I'm working to make it shorter but I try to make the content fit it.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.640]   Sometimes like this one, this episode is too long.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   Would it have been better if two?
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.640]   Well, whatever.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.280]   I'm going to try to help people and I just say, "I'm not going to reach the people who
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.080]   are looking for something short but I'm doing my best to help people."
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.320]   As the old song goes, "If you need a speech, an hour speech today, I'm ready right now.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.600]   If you need a five-minute speech, I need a few weeks to prepare."
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.640]   That's the reality of it.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.280]   I've worked and worked and worked on this outline but I probably should have cut it
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.280]   down.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.200]   I need to ship the show.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.200]   Too long, agree.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.440]   Too rambly was accurate.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.080]   My intention was not to make a show rambly but that wasn't accurate and that was due
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.320]   to my own lack of skill.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:26.640]   What a commenter doesn't understand in that situation is that I'm not capable of doing
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.800]   a show that's less rambly.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.320]   I have to learn that skill set.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.960]   It's easy for me to criticize a runner for not being fast enough but they're running
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.100]   as fast as they're capable of.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:44.440]   As a broadcaster, I'm being as concise as I'm capable of based upon the time that I've
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.080]   allotted, etc.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.840]   Those are accurate pieces of feedback.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.160]   The feedback about religion and politics, now that's feedback that filters back through
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.520]   my vision.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.920]   I talk about religion.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:01.120]   I talk about politics because I am flat out convinced that those are two of the most important
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.160]   things that affect our lives.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.360]   But in our modern society, we've decided that it's unpolite somehow to talk about religion
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.360]   and politics.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.520]   I don't think there's anything more important to talk about.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:15.400]   With regard to money, your religion and politics will affect what you do and how you do it
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.280]   with money more than just about anything else.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.640]   It'll affect everything.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.040]   It'll affect how much income you earn.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.400]   It'll affect everything related to money.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.600]   Now I don't lead with that because I don't think it's a particularly great lead to say,
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.000]   "Let me do this," but I see the themes.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:40.560]   For me, I'm not willing to sacrifice my integrity to have a popular show.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:46.420]   If I dropped those things, I could have a more popular show, but I don't want that show
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:49.640]   because I wouldn't be able to look myself in the mirror.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.160]   As far as handling constructive feedback, that's what you have to look at.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:56.760]   You have to look and say, "Is this feedback something that I'm willing to do something
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.160]   about or is this feedback not something that I'm willing to do something about and does
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.960]   this fit my vision?"
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:10.060]   Those would be my pieces of advice of how to address constructive feedback.
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:12.680]   Read what people say about your show in any format.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:17.080]   Read the emails that you get and then filter it back through what are you trying to do
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.720]   and what are your opinions.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:23.000]   How should you handle potential sponsor partners or affiliate relationships?
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.940]   I've never negotiated a business partnership.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:28.880]   You should handle them the way that you would want them to be handled if somebody were handling
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.040]   it with you.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.520]   Make a partnership deal win-win and practice making a deal.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.640]   The most important words in your vocabulary should be, "Let's make a deal," and you should
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.540]   look for making a deal.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:46.480]   Every single deal has to have both people coming away feeling like they benefited more.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:52.540]   In your employment situation, if you're employed, your employer must feel that they are getting
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:57.780]   more value from you than the cost that you are costing them.
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:01.080]   They must feel like they are winning.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.080]   If they don't, you're out of a job.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:07.380]   Now, you on the other hand, you must feel like you're getting more benefit from your
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.720]   employer than you're costing them, than it's costing you.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.480]   You've got to feel like you've got to get the better of a deal.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:17.480]   The way I go to a business deal is try to find something who is going to, how can we
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:20.080]   make a deal where we both win?
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:27.320]   In my selections for sponsors, what I have said is I will only do a deal that is a win-win-win.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.640]   I'll only do a deal, number one, where my audience wins.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:35.200]   I will not bring irrelevant advertising onto my show.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.200]   It's got to be relevant.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.780]   It's got to be useful because if I'm going to take a minute of my listeners' valuable
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:46.320]   time in order to do an ad for them, then it's got to be at least useful.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.060]   I'm working hard to make it even more relevant.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.060]   But they've got to win.
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.600]   The product has to be good and they've got to win by buying it.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:56.320]   Number two, it's got to work for me and it's got to work for the other person.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.720]   So it's got to be a win-win-win deal.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.840]   The business negotiation should be very simple.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.800]   And I'll tell you, my contracts for my ad deals, I wrote them myself.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.800]   They're like three paragraphs.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.800]   I wrote them myself.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.400]   I sat down in a word process and here's what I commit to do.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.800]   Here's what I expect from you.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.360]   Sent it over to them and signed it.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:19.800]   And the people I've dealt with, big teams of attorneys, et cetera, I've signed a couple
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.800]   of contracts.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.420]   It's not always my contract.
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:27.000]   My contracts that I've done are three paragraphs, one side of a page.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.400]   Contracts that I get back from other companies, 32 pages.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   It's stupid.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.660]   So make a deal, a win-win, and just make things simple.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.480]   How do you go about sourcing new guests?
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:41.860]   I choose people that I think have a message or an idea or an experience or a philosophy
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:50.700]   or a story or something that will challenge or will educate or will inspire my audience.
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:52.760]   I don't think so much about entertainment.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.300]   I probably should think more.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:58.180]   The most popular forms of media are always going to be entertainment.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:04.260]   But I'm looking through people who are going to challenge or educate or inspire my audience.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.620]   That's what I'm looking for.
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.140]   So I'm always looking for guests.
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:10.340]   I ignore some expert credentials.
[01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:14.980]   I turn more experts down than I accept as far as on the show, and I look for normal
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:15.980]   people.
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:22.220]   So with my vision of the show, I'm wanting my show, my stuff to be accessible.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:24.220]   I'm wanting it to be accessible to people.
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:27.740]   So I try to bring on normal everyday people and experts.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:30.140]   So that's been my philosophy along the way.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:31.140]   Is it right?
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.140]   Is it wrong?
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.140]   I have no idea.
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.140]   It's working so far.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:39.220]   And so because I'm fulfilling my vision and I'm happy with the show, I continue to do
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:40.820]   what I think is right.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.300]   So those are my lessons learned.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.300]   Those are my tips.
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:46.180]   I hope this is useful to you.
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:50.460]   Radical Personal Finance is not about podcasting, but I do want to help because I was looking
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:55.460]   for information from people who were experienced and I just struggled to find it a couple years
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:56.460]   ago.
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.180]   So I'm trying to pay back.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:01.660]   Many people have been hugely helpful to me, and I want to thank so many people who have
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.860]   been helpful.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:05.780]   Those are my philosophies.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:08.580]   I don't claim they're right, but they are my philosophies.
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:11.900]   And you can judge for yourself whether they work or not.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:16.260]   I am thankful that I have been able to build really great relationships with many people
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:17.860]   in my audience.
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:22.460]   It's really encouraging to me.
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:29.220]   And I know because I get the emails that I've been able to impact some lives positively,
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.780]   which is what I'm able to do.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:36.660]   And I've been able to build a business that sustains my household, which is a location
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:40.020]   dependent, which was my definition of financial freedom.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.100]   So I've hit my goals with Radical Personal Finance.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.060]   Now my goals are changing.
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.060]   They're getting bigger, they're getting more.
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:47.060]   I'm going to keep on working.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.740]   I'm going to keep getting better.
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:55.220]   And I will be very disappointed if 300 episodes from now, they're not way better.
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:56.660]   I'll be very disappointed with myself.
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:00.820]   But they're going to get better because this is just a process.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:01.820]   So enjoy the process.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:03.060]   I love doing this.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.500]   It's hard work.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.700]   You will go through the honeymoon phase of your business.
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:10.660]   For two days, I've been trying to get this show out and I've had to force myself to sit
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:12.260]   down and get it done.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.180]   So it's seven o'clock at night here at a conference.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:19.380]   I haven't eaten since breakfast because I've been in meetings and in sessions and whatnot.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.540]   But it's a job.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.980]   This is my job and I've got to do my best to get my job done.
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:25.980]   So you're going to do those things.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.180]   But still, I wouldn't trade it.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.180]   I love what I'm doing.
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:33.260]   And I really, really, really want every member of this audience to at least consider starting
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:40.220]   a podcast because, friends, we live in a time where the freedom of communication is fantastic.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:45.100]   But in order for us to continue to grow and improve our lives, we need to grasp it and
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:48.020]   use it as a force for good.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:49.220]   Thank you all for listening.

[01:35:58.460 --> 01:35:59.460]   Thank you so much.
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:08.860]   I haven't said thank you so much to finish a podcast and hundreds of episodes.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:10.940]   That's the worst ending ever.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.980]   But yet still, I'm learning.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.820]   Peace out.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:19.340]   Don't just dream about paradise.
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.140]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:25.180]   Escape the ordinary with Fiji Airways Global Beat the Rush Sale.
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:30.140]   Immerse yourself in white sandy beaches or dive deep into coral reefs.
