[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.960]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.440]   Today, we are discussing aggression.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.520]   I'm going to explain to you
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.780]   that there are several different types of aggression.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.360]   For instance, reactive aggression
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.720]   versus proactive aggression,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.440]   meaning sometimes people will be aggressive
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.840]   because they feel threatened or they are protecting those
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.440]   that they love who also feel threatened.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.960]   There's also proactive aggression
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.520]   where people go out of their way
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.920]   to deliberately try and harm others.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.240]   And there is indirect aggression,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.320]   which is aggression not involving physical violence,
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.760]   for instance, shaming people and things of that sort.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.240]   It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.860]   underlying each of the different types of aggression.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.980]   And today I will define those for you.
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.880]   I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.680]   that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.760]   talk about some of the hormones and peptides
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.480]   and neurotransmitters involved.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.540]   I promise to make it all accessible to you,
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.960]   even if you do not have any biology or science background.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.920]   I will also discuss tools,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   psychological tools and biological tools
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.360]   that one can use to better control aggression.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.440]   Now, right here at the outset,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.640]   I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600]   has to have an element of context within it.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.120]   To be fair, human beings invest a lot of money,
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.400]   a lot of time and a lot of energy,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.880]   and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.860]   Later, I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.440]   that reinforce, in other words,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.760]   reward through the release of chemicals
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.000]   that make people feel good, acts of aggression.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.080]   However, what I'm mainly referring to
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.740]   is the context in which human beings will pay money
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.000]   in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.400]   Put it simply, people spend an enormous amount of money
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.240]   and time and energy watching other people engage in,
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.880]   for instance, aggressive sports.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.440]   And we know that observing your team winning
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   over another team causes the release of neurochemicals
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.200]   in your brain and body that make you feel good,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.940]   and yes, that can make you feel more aggressive.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.000]   We also know, of course,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.080]   that most governments invest many billions,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.600]   if not trillions of dollars in infrastructure technologies
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.320]   and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.180]   so-called military warfare, et cetera.
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.600]   So today's discussion will include a description of aggression
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.300]   in the pathological sense.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.220]   We'll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.820]   that most of you probably haven't heard of,
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.280]   but is actually far more common than perhaps you know.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.000]   We'll talk about the role of things
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.200]   like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.520]   and how that can relate to aggression
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.000]   through the relationship between impulsivity
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.840]   and aggression.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.760]   And we'll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.960]   proactive aggression as mentioned before,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.500]   and reactive aggression.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.960]   I'm certain that by the end of the episode,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.760]   you will come away with a much more thorough understanding
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.720]   of what this thing that we call aggression really is.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.900]   And when you see it in other people,
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.760]   I think it will make more sense to you.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.080]   And when you observe it in yourself
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.280]   or the impulse to engage in aggression,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.640]   verbal or physical or otherwise,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.660]   I hope that you'll understand it better as well.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.060]   And of course, the tools that I will describe
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.200]   should allow you to modulate and control
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.220]   aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness,
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.920]   and just generally to be able to engage with people
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.060]   in a more adaptive way overall.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.700]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.580]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.000]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.960]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.880]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.440]   to the general public.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.480]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.520]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.920]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.540]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.640]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.920]   that's designed to meet all your foundational health needs.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.260]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.020]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.760]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.360]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.280]   once or twice a day is that it covers
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.920]   all of my basic vitamin mineral and probiotic needs.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.820]   The probiotics are especially important to me.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.080]   There are now abundant data showing that the gut microbiome,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.400]   which is basically a community
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.720]   of trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.540]   are beneficial for our immune system, for brain function,
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.920]   for mood, and many other aspects of our health.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.520]   The gut microbiome thrives on probiotics
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.580]   and Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.700]   to optimize the gut microbiome.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.020]   Athletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.960]   from physical and mental exertion,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.360]   digestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin C, zinc,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.460]   as I mentioned before,
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.260]   all the other vitamins and minerals that you need
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.280]   in order to cover your basic needs each day.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.660]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.380]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.120]   and claim a special offer.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.680]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.220]   that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.060]   while you're on the road
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.580]   and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.800]   There's now a wealth of data showing that vitamin D3
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.640]   is important for many aspects
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.960]   of our immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   Many people, even if they get out in the sunlight,
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.440]   are not getting enough vitamin D3.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.520]   And the K2 is thought to be beneficial
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   for calcium regulation
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.440]   and a number of other things important to our health.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.200]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.500]   you can claim the special offer of the five free travel packs
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.520]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.000]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.120]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.200]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.680]   from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.080]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.580]   I've spent a lifetime working
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.480]   on the biology of the visual system.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.420]   I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.200]   with some pretty tough challenges
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.240]   as you move throughout the day.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.600]   For instance, if you go from a brightly lit region
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.520]   to a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.440]   with those sorts of adjustments in mind.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.320]   So for instance, if you're outside in the shade,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.080]   you move into the sun and then back into the shade,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.640]   you don't have to take your sunglasses on and off.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.000]   Their glasses were initially designed for sports performance
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.820]   and the great thing is they can be used for that,
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.760]   but also they have a terrific aesthetic
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.880]   so you can wear them to work or out to dinner.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.080]   I wear readers at night and when I drive at night
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.500]   and I wear sunglasses if I'm out a lot
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.540]   on really bright days.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.200]   The terrific thing about Roca glasses
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.220]   is that even if you get sweaty, they won't fall off
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.600]   so you can run with them, you can cycle with them,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.560]   or as I mentioned before,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.460]   you can just wear them out and about.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.920]   If you'd like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.840]   that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.080]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.240]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.560]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.460]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.300]   that in my opinion are the very best you'll find.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.680]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.080]   a little over a year ago
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.980]   and it's the best sleep I've had ever since.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.340]   If you go to the Helix site,
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.800]   they have a terrific sleep quiz
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.060]   that just takes a few minutes,
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.760]   asks you questions like, do you tend to sleep on your side,
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.020]   your back or your stomach?
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.940]   Maybe you don't know because you're asleep,
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.260]   but many people do know.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.780]   And even if you don't know, that's okay.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.100]   It will also ask you questions like,
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.700]   do you tend to run hot or cold?
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.800]   Do you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.060]   And by taking that brief quiz,
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.020]   they will match you to the specific mattress
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.800]   that's ideal for you and your sleep needs.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.540]   And that's really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.300]   Everybody's unique and they know that.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.440]   So if you take this quiz,
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.800]   you'll get matched to a particular mattress.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.980]   For me, it was the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.640]   but again, that's just me and you may match to that one
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.960]   or you may match to a different one.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.540]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.620]   and sleeping much better,
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.020]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.340]   take that two minute sleep quiz
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.840]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.920]   and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.200]   and two free pillows.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.460]   I also love their pillows.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.740]   I've always had this issue with pillows
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.060]   that they heat up too much.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.520]   I'm always looking for the pillow that can cool itself.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.580]   Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.160]   They're also not too big, so they're not propped up.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.180]   Not getting the text neck in the middle of the night,
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.060]   but I shouldn't push my chest nor am I falling back
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.940]   and having trouble breathing in the middle of the night.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.180]   They're designed just right.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.820]   They also have a 10 years warranty
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.540]   and you get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.100]   They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.320]   but I think that you will.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.160]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.080]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.040]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.780]   Let's talk about aggression.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.860]   I think that many people out there are put off by aggression,
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.980]   although others are drawn to aggression,
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.260]   both in themselves and when observing it in others.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.440]   The reason to talk about aggression is that,
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.020]   as mentioned before,
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.140]   the context of aggression really matters.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.740]   So there are instances where aggression is adaptive.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.300]   For instance, a mother protecting her children,
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.400]   if she's being attacked
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.580]   or if her children are being threatened,
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.280]   I think most people would agree
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.180]   that so-called maternal aggression of that sort,
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.620]   provided the context is right, is a great thing.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.780]   Protecting our young is, after all,
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.500]   one of the primary adaptive drives of our species,
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.240]   and thank goodness it is.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.860]   Of course, other forms of aggression
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.880]   like unprovoked proactive aggression,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.900]   somebody simply being violent to somebody else,
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.220]   even when unprovoked.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.700]   Most of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.100]   It can even evoke aggression in people
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.700]   when they observe that kind of behavior.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.140]   So again, context really matters,
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.900]   but a more general and perhaps an even more important reason
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.760]   to think about and understand aggression
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.580]   is that by understanding the biology
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.520]   and psychology of aggression,
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.820]   you will be in a much better position
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.820]   to understand how all emotional states come to be,
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.100]   both in yourself and in others.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.800]   For instance, many of you have probably heard the statement
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.420]   that I believe arises from pop psychology,
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.820]   not from formal academic psychology,
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.220]   that aggression is just sadness.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.220]   It's a form of sadness that's amplified
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.020]   and it shows up as aggression.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.460]   But when we look at the underlying biology
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.780]   and the peer-reviewed literature on this,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.600]   nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.920]   We have distinct circuits in the brain
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.880]   for aggression versus grief and mourning.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.280]   Those are non-overlapping.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.940]   Now, that doesn't mean that you can't be sad and aggressive
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.980]   or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.740]   but the idea that sadness and aggression
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.460]   are one and the same thing is simply not true.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.760]   And by understanding that or perhaps by understanding
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.060]   that irritability and aggression are not the same thing,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.080]   you'll be in a much better position to apply
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.260]   some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.940]   in order to be able to reduce or eliminate,
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.860]   or if it's adaptive to you, to modulate aggression.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.680]   And yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.460]   in some cases, even amplifying aggression can be adaptive.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.700]   Now, this of course is not the first discussion
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.840]   about the biology of aggression
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.340]   or the psychology of aggression.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.380]   And we really can look to the beginning of the last century
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.520]   as the time in which the formal study
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.700]   of aggression really began.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.980]   One of the names that's most associated
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.860]   with the formal study of aggression
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.660]   is none other than Conrad Lorenz.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.540]   Some of you may be familiar with that name.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.660]   Others of you may not be familiar with that name.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.420]   Conrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.940]   and fixed action pattern behaviors.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.840]   He's most famous, at least in scientific circles,
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.340]   for getting geese to believe that he was their parent.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.540]   And if you were to put into Google Conrad with a K Lorenz,
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.140]   just as it sounds, Conrad Lorenz geese,
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.860]   you're going to see a lot of photos of Conrad
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.240]   walking down roads with a lot of geese following him
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.860]   or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.820]   He had a habit of geese adopting him
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.740]   because of the behaviors that he partook in.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.220]   So he would swim out on a lake
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.300]   in front of a bunch of little geese,
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.980]   and then they would think that he was the parent
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.900]   and they would imprint on him.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.380]   He even lived with these animals and they lived with him.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.620]   Sort of a strange character from what I hear.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.080]   But nonetheless, all this work was deserving
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.460]   of a Nobel prize because what he discovered
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.140]   were fixed action patterns, that is patterns of behavior
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.300]   that could be evoked by a single stimulus.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.940]   This is really important.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.160]   The idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors,
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.580]   like swimming behind a parent
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.640]   or looking to somebody for comfort and only them.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   The idea that you could get a huge category
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.020]   of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.580]   triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.180]   because what it suggested and what turns out to be true
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.420]   is that there are neural circuits,
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.740]   not just individual brain areas,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.060]   but collections of brain areas that work together
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.620]   to engage a pattern of behaviors.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.580]   And that's the first fundamental principle
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.260]   that we need to define today.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.600]   That when we talk about aggression,
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.520]   we're talking about activation of neural circuits,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.980]   not individual brain areas,
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.900]   but neural circuits that get played out in sequence,
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.980]   like keys on a piano.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.140]   But that playing out in sequence means that aggression
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.220]   is a verb, it has a beginning, a middle and an end.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.900]   And it's a process, it's not an event.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.060]   And as you'll see, that turns out to be very important
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.900]   in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.060]   prevent it from happening before it's initiated,
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.740]   or maybe even prolonging aggression if that's what's needed.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.000]   Now, Conrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.860]   I mean, obviously he knew there was this thing
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.260]   that we call a brain and a nervous system.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.960]   And he knew that there were chemicals in the brain
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.720]   and hormones and things of that sort
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.240]   that were likely to play a role,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.160]   but he really didn't take any measures
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.860]   to define what the neural circuits were.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.700]   Frankly, he didn't need to.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.020]   He had his Nobel prize and he did all this beautiful work.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.800]   He's known for an abundance of work,
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.260]   but he did think about what sorts of underlying processes
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.740]   could drive something like aggression.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.600]   And he talked about one particular feature
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.060]   that's especially important.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.540]   And that's this notion of a pressure.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.540]   The idea that, yes, certain hormones will bias somebody
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.380]   or an animal to be aggressive.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.980]   Certain neurotransmitter states,
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.400]   and you'll learn what those are today,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.740]   will bias somebody to be more or less aggressive,
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.640]   maybe even submissive and passive,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.340]   maybe outright proactively aggressive
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.900]   towards anyone or anything in front of them.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.640]   And yes, of course, there will be historical features
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.300]   based on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.540]   He understood that there will be a constellation of things
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.620]   that would drive people to be aggressive.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.260]   And he described a so-called pressure,
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.740]   almost like a hydraulic pressure.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.340]   Just think about fluid pressure in a small container
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.260]   being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.620]   or the container is ready to explode.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.080]   And how multiple features, multiple variables
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.220]   could impinge on that and create that pressure.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.980]   It turns out that's exactly the way the system works.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.540]   There is no single brain area
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.820]   that flips the switch for aggression.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.620]   Although we'll soon talk about a brain structure
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.940]   that generally houses the propensity
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.400]   and the output of aggression.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.700]   This notion of a hydraulic pressure
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.480]   that can drive us toward aggressive behavior,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.460]   or conversely can be very low pressure
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.640]   and keep us in a state of non-reactivity,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.660]   maybe even passivity or submissiveness
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.100]   is a very important feature
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.300]   because it really captures the essence
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.900]   of how neural circuits work
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.380]   when we're talking about primitive behaviors generally.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.320]   And you can start to notice this in yourself and in others.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.480]   You can start to notice
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.800]   when you are veering toward aggression
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.980]   or when someone is veering toward aggression,
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.100]   verbal or physical.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.980]   Now that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.420]   that Lorenz was referring to.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.200]   And it really does have an underlying biological basis.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.980]   Now it was some years later
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.480]   that the first experiments came along,
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.940]   which really started to identify the brain areas
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.600]   and the biological so-called pressures
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.340]   that can induce aggressive behavior.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.140]   And the person that really gets credit for this
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.100]   is a guy by the name of Walter Hess,
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.780]   who at that time was working on cats.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.960]   And I know that when you say working on cats,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.860]   a lot of people will cringe,
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.240]   a lot of people have cats as pets,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.380]   and certainly cats can be delightful.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.500]   Some people like them more, some people like them less.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.220]   Most people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.640]   I should say that these days,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.480]   very few laboratories work on cats.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.700]   Most laboratories that work on animal models
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.220]   will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.380]   for their capacity to do genetics,
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.220]   on laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.420]   And occasionally you'll find a lab
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.400]   that still works on cats.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.300]   Back in the time of Hess,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.100]   very few laboratories worked on mice.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.380]   Most laboratories worked on cats or rats.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.940]   And the reason for that is nowadays
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.220]   most laboratories use mice if they use animal models
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.560]   because of the genetic tools that exist in mice
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.480]   to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.100]   which can't be done in humans or non-human primates,
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.660]   at least not very easily at this point in history.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.380]   So when I say he was working on cats,
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.560]   I realized that probably evoked some negative emotions
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.540]   in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.900]   What we can do, however, is look at the data
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.980]   and make use of the data in terms of our understanding.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.880]   What Hess did was he had cats that were awake
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.120]   and he was able to lower stimulating electrode
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:25.960]   into their brain.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.780]   Now, keep in mind that the brain
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.520]   does not have any pain sensors.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.860]   So after a small hole is made in the skull,
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.300]   electrodes are lowered into the brain.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.380]   This is what's done commonly in human neurosurgery.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.440]   And he was able to stimulate different brain areas.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.180]   And he was sort of poking around.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.100]   And when I say sort of,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.660]   he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.160]   He wasn't just poking around in there for fun.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.220]   He was trying to identify brain regions
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.760]   that could generate entire categories of behavior,
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.300]   a la Lorenz, right?
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.160]   These fixed action pattern behaviors.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.320]   Eventually, his electrode landed in a site
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.980]   and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.980]   that caused this otherwise passive purring, relaxing cat
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.120]   to suddenly go into an absolute rage.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.300]   So arched back, hissing, hair up,
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.320]   so-called pyloerection where the hairs go up.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.340]   Animals try and make themselves as big as possible,
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.840]   often when they're aggressive.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.200]   Drooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.080]   cats and other animals can do this.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.040]   And the cat tried to attack him and anyone else
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.240]   and anything else, even inanimate objects
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.860]   when he stimulated this particular brain area.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.120]   So Hess obviously took notice
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   of this incredible transformation in behavior.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.280]   And the fact that when he turned off the stimulation
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.760]   of this particular brain area,
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.980]   the cat very quickly within seconds
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.080]   went back to being passive calm kitty.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.580]   Now, of course, he repeated this experiment in other animals
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.760]   because he had to confirm that it wasn't just happenstance,
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.340]   that there wasn't something unique about this one cat
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.500]   that perhaps he had stimulated an area
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.400]   that had been built up during the kittenhood
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.560]   of this cat and had been reactivated.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.780]   Maybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.820]   or scared and reactivation of a particular circuit
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.020]   unique to that cat created this aggressive behavior.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:23.860]   That wasn't the case.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.600]   Every cat that he looked at
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.800]   and stimulated this particular brain area,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.280]   the cat would immediately go into an aggressive,
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.560]   almost rage type behavior.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.320]   Now, of course, we can't anthropomorphize.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.720]   We don't know what the cat was feeling.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.080]   For all we know, the cat could be happy,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.060]   although that seems pretty unlikely.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.820]   And later experiments done in mice, but also in humans,
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.480]   confirm that indeed stimulation of this brain area
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.800]   evoked not just behavioral aggression,
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.360]   but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.520]   So what was this incredible brain area?
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.760]   Or rather, I should say,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.540]   what is the brain area that harbored
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.120]   this incredible capacity to generate aggressive behavior
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.500]   in Hess's experiments?
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.560]   Well, for those of you that are regular listeners
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.600]   to this podcast, you'll probably be relieved to know
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.580]   that today we're going to talk
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.320]   about some new neural circuits.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.560]   Oftentimes we'll center back on the amygdala
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.040]   or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.840]   And for those of you that haven't heard them before,
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.040]   don't worry, I'll make it clear
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.000]   as to what those brain areas are and what they do.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.560]   But today we're going to talk a lot
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   about the so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.360]   The ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.760]   meaning a small collection of neurons.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.880]   What are neurons?
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.280]   Nerve cells.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.520]   And that small collection of neurons
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.420]   that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.940]   It's only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.400]   and a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side of your brain.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.680]   And that combined 3,000 neurons or so,
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.720]   it's not exactly 3,000, but 3,000 neurons or so
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.920]   is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.520]   of the sort that Hess observed in the cat.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.660]   And believe it or not,
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.560]   when you see somebody who's in an act of rage
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.080]   or in an act of verbal aggression
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.240]   or in an act of defensive aggression,
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.920]   protecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:28.320]   almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.680]   Those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.360]   And next I'll describe some experiments
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.760]   that were done just recently within the last 10 years or so,
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.060]   but leading right up until this year and even last month
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.960]   that keep confirming again and again and again
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.600]   that it is the activity of neurons
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.960]   in the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.360]   that are both necessary and sufficient
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.780]   to generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.400]   Now, before I go further to describe
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.600]   the beautiful recent studies on the VMH,
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.240]   the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.080]   and the important role of testosterone,
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.480]   and more importantly estrogen
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.200]   in the activation of aggressive behavior.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.680]   That's right, that's soon to be clear to you
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.800]   why that's the case.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.060]   I want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.840]   is something that we should all care about, why?
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.380]   Well, it turns out that many categories
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.880]   of psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.120]   and psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia,
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.680]   PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.880]   borderline personality disorder,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.960]   and even certain forms of autism
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.000]   can include elements of aggression and even violence.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.700]   Now, it's certainly not the case
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.980]   that aggression and violence are present
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.840]   in all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.360]   or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.240]   I'm absolutely not saying that.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.040]   However, it can be a feature of those,
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.720]   and it's a well-described feature
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.680]   in terms of trying to understand the constellation
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.120]   of challenges that people suffer from when they have those.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.040]   So thinking about the VMH goes way beyond
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.160]   just understanding basic aggression
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.120]   in the context of adaptive aggression.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.200]   So when earlier I used the example maternal aggression,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.640]   that's one adaptive form of aggression.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.440]   It also can be pathologic aggression,
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.480]   meaning it can harm ourselves or others.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.040]   So keep this in mind as we go forward,
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.600]   because later we're going to talk about specific tools
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.760]   designed to modulate or prevent aggression in,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.800]   for instance, people with
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.720]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   and especially kids with ADHD.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.080]   In the meantime, let's return to the VMH,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.320]   this relatively small collection of neurons.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.840]   And the reason I say relatively small is,
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.200]   well, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.640]   maybe even trillions of neurons.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   The exact number of neurons isn't really clear,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.040]   but it's a lot.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.080]   And it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons,
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.680]   this 3000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.500]   that can evoke this aggressive response.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.960]   Experiments done by David Anderson's lab at Caltech,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.980]   were really the first to parse the fine circuitry
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.960]   and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.280]   is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.360]   These are important experiments
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.460]   and they're worth knowing about.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.500]   What they did was they identified,
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.220]   first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.120]   was in the mouse.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.360]   That was pretty straightforward to do,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.800]   sort of known before they started these experiments.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.900]   And then they analyzed which genes,
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.840]   meaning which DNA, which of course,
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.480]   becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.200]   which DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.860]   in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.560]   And it turns out that there's a particular category
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.040]   of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.420]   that make an estrogen receptor.
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.020]   And it is those neurons in particular
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.080]   that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.020]   How did they know this?
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.540]   Well, they used a tool that's actually been described
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.160]   by a previous guest of this podcast.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.720]   We had an episode with the psychiatrist and bio engineer
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.620]   and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.800]   Carl Deisseroth.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.000]   He and others have developed tools
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.600]   that allow people to control the activity of neurons,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.880]   essentially by remote control,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.560]   by shining light on those neurons.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.840]   So in the context of an experiment on a mouse,
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.240]   which is what David's lab did,
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.160]   and these were the beautiful experiments of Dai Yu Lin,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.920]   who's now in her own laboratory at New York University,
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.160]   put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.220]   of the hypo, into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.520]   The mouse is able to move around in its cage, freely moving.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.400]   Even though it has a little tether, this little wire,
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.600]   it's a very thin wire.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.360]   And that little thin wire is actually a little,
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.440]   what we call optrode.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.840]   And the experimentalist, in this case, Dai Yu,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.640]   was able to stimulate the turning on
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.700]   of a little bit of blue light.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.000]   And that blue light activated
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.340]   only those estrogen receptor neurons
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.280]   in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.400]   And the way she was able to do that
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.680]   is she had introduced a gene
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.120]   that had been developed by our friend, Carl Deisseroth,
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.240]   that allows light to trigger electrical activity
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.060]   in those neurons.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.180]   So if any of that is confusing,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.120]   or if all of that is confusing, here's the experiment.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.160]   There's a mouse in a cage,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.620]   has a little wire coming out of its head.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.520]   It doesn't notice, believe it or not.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.340]   We know this 'cause it's still eating and mating
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.760]   and doing all the things that mice like to do
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.240]   on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.320]   And the mere pressing of a button
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.120]   will activate a little bit of light
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.680]   released at the end of that wire.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.040]   That light activates particular neurons.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.920]   In this case, it's the estrogen receptor-containing neurons
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.840]   in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.280]   When that mouse is in a cage with another mouse,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.280]   a couple of things happen,
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.820]   depending on what the other mouse is,
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.200]   or we could say who the other mouse is.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.040]   If it's a male mouse,
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.240]   and you put it in there with a female mouse,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.280]   the male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.320]   Provided that the male mouse has gone through puberty,
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.900]   he will try to mount and mate with a female mouse.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.220]   Now, female mice are either in a receptive phase
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.720]   or a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   They don't have a menstrual 28-day cycle,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.480]   they have an estrous cycle.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.000]   And on particular days of that estrous cycle,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.400]   they are not happy to mate.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.420]   They will basically keep their hindquarters
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.540]   away from the male mouse at all costs.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.280]   They'll even attack the male mouse.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.600]   On certain days of the estrous cycle, however,
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.760]   the female mouse will undergo what's called lordosis,
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.280]   which is an arching of her back,
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.760]   and she'll allow the male to mount and mate with her.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.560]   So a large number of experiments were done,
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.440]   but the first experiment really was
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.320]   to put the male mouse in with a female mouse
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.300]   who's in the so-called receptive phase of estrous.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.120]   That is, she will allow mating.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.300]   And he starts mating with her.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.720]   And they go through the standard repertoire
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.420]   of mating behaviors that you observe in mice,
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.600]   mounting, thrusting, intromission,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.280]   as it's called in the mouse sex world.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.560]   Well, I guess, I don't know what the mice call it,
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.360]   but that's what the experimenters call it.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.960]   And then afterwards, he will dismount, okay?
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.440]   So they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.840]   It's very typical.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.080]   But about halfway through the behavior,
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.600]   Dayu turned on the light
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.880]   to stimulate these estrogen receptor-containing neurons
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.200]   only in the male mouse.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.120]   And what she observed was incredibly dramatic.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.360]   The male mouse ceases from trying to mate
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.200]   with the female mouse
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.500]   and immediately tries to kill the female mouse.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.700]   He starts attacking her.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.120]   Then she turns off the light, the male stops,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.200]   and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.240]   I'm sure all of this was very confusing
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.840]   and disturbing to the female mouse.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.320]   Nonetheless, that was the repertoire.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.480]   They would mate.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.420]   She would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.840]   The male mouse would immediately
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.800]   try and attack and kill the female mouse.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.660]   And then she would stop the stimulation,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.280]   and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.880]   return to the attempt, at least,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.460]   to mate with the female mouse.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.060]   These are such dramatic shifts in behavior
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.880]   triggered only by the activation
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.660]   of only the small set of neurons
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.600]   within the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.260]   And for those of you that think
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.880]   that you can watch this sort of thing
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.300]   without being disturbed,
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.180]   I encourage you to go to YouTube.
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.240]   We will provide a link where you can see a video
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.180]   of this type of behavior.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.980]   It's incredibly dramatic.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.300]   The shift in behavior is almost instantaneous,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.060]   occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds,
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.320]   thousandths of a second.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.020]   The next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.760]   with this stimulation with light capability
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.740]   in its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone,
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.340]   but with a rubber glove filled with air or water.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.740]   Mouse was walking around sniffing, peeing,
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.000]   which is what male mice seem to do.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.520]   They seem to urinate everywhere.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.000]   Essentially an interesting, perhaps interesting feature
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.920]   of male mice and actually many male animals,
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.820]   perhaps even humans, we don't know, or maybe we do know.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.580]   Basically, this has been observed time and time again
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.380]   in experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers' lab
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.540]   at the Scripps Institute has characterized this.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.240]   If you put female mice into an arena or a cage,
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.900]   they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.180]   Whereas if you put male mice into an arena or a cage,
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.340]   they urinate everywhere.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.540]   They have this kind of obsession
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.400]   with spraying their urine everywhere.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.540]   You can sort of transpose that to human behavior
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.380]   if you like.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.720]   In any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone,
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.300]   but with this rubber glove,
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.720]   the mouse is walking around, urinating, et cetera,
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.220]   doing whatever it is that mice do.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.460]   Then she stimulates the activation
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.940]   of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons,
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.380]   and the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.420]   It goes into a rage attacking the glove
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:55.040]   as if it were another mouse or some other animate object,
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.780]   but of course it's an inanimate object.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.340]   It's just a rubber glove.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.780]   She stops the stimulation and the mouse immediately goes back
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.820]   to being completely calm or at least not attacking.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.680]   Again, we don't know what the mouse was feeling.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.460]   So these are very dramatic videos.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.080]   Again, you can see them by following the link
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.860]   that we'll provide in the caption.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.180]   If that sort of thing is going to disturb you
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.200]   to see, for instance, the attack,
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.760]   one mouse attacking another, please just don't watch them.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.580]   I'm not interested in traumatizing anybody.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.480]   Are you traumatizing yourself, that is?
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.020]   A number of different variations
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.080]   were done on this experiment.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   For instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.740]   as opposed to male mice,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.700]   putting the female mice in with other female mice
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.420]   or with other male mice.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.980]   No matter what variation one carries out,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.680]   so it doesn't matter if it's male with female,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.380]   male with male, female with female, et cetera,
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.060]   stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.660]   in a male mouse or a female mouse
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.580]   evokes this very dramatic,
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.140]   almost instantaneous aggressive behavior,
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.700]   physically aggressive behavior.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.100]   Subsequent experiments done by Dai-Yu Lin
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.540]   in her own laboratory and other laboratories
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.840]   have shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.720]   is connected with a bunch of other brain areas
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.560]   that are interesting,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.520]   and I'll talk about some of those in a little bit,
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.940]   but one of them that I want to call out now
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.240]   is the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.220]   This is a large structure in the back of the brain
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.820]   that houses things like neurons that can create opioids.
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.040]   We all know of the opioid crisis,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.920]   but these are neurons that can produce endogenous means
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.720]   made by the body, chemicals that can cause pain relief.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.800]   You could understand why that might occur
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.260]   in a circuit for aggression, right?
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.720]   Even if one is the aggressor,
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.820]   it's likely that they may incur some physical damage
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.480]   and they'd want some pain relief.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.340]   The PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.380]   that eventually through several processing stations,
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.220]   excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.620]   And in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.820]   can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.240]   Now, aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.440]   because in humans, and especially in human children,
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.300]   biting is something that while young children might do
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.440]   as a form of aggression,
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.040]   tends to disappear pretty early in childhood.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.540]   And if it doesn't, it's often seen as a mark of pathology.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.400]   I have a story about this.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.140]   Actually, when I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.080]   and I'll never forget this.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.260]   We were playing soccer and in a rare stroke of luck
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.080]   or accident, I happened to score a goal.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.580]   I wasn't a particularly good soccer player,
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.940]   especially not at that stage of my life.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.740]   They later figured out that it was just better
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.020]   to make me a fullback 'cause I could just wait there
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.420]   and do what fullbacks do.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.720]   I was better at taking the ball or the person out
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.460]   than I was putting the ball in the goal.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.340]   Nonetheless, I, again, by chance, I scored a goal
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.900]   and I was trotting back to my side of the field.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.600]   And all of a sudden I felt this sting in my back.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.260]   A kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name,
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.180]   I'm not going to tell you what his name was,
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.420]   a kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.440]   And this, of course, resulted in a discussion
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.800]   and a timeout and all the usual things.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.540]   And parents, I think, got involved.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.700]   I don't recall.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.180]   I didn't think much else of it.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.420]   But I recall that this was considered
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.740]   especially troubling behavior because he bit me
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.880]   as opposed to hit me or shoved me down
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.920]   or something of that sort.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.520]   And it does seem as if the tendency to use biting
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.500]   as an aggressive behavior is associated
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.920]   with a more primitive circuitry.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.800]   Now here, I'm truly anthropomorphizing.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.720]   I don't know what this other kid happened to be thinking
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.900]   or feeling at the time.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.740]   How could I?
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.460]   And I certainly am not going to say that biting
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.060]   in every case reflects a pathology.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.360]   Although I think there is general agreement
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.660]   in the psychology community and the psychiatric community
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.480]   that past a certain age, the using of one's teeth
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.500]   to impart aggression and damage on others
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.660]   is a particularly primitive and troubling,
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.560]   or at least for the observer or the person
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.320]   that experiences a pretty disturbing event.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.980]   Daew's lab has shown that activation
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.540]   of the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.240]   a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray,
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.780]   which then triggers a whole other set of circuits
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.020]   of fixed action patterns.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.760]   Here we are back to Lorenz again with fixed action patterns,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.320]   including swinging of the limbs, right, punching.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.700]   This wouldn't necessarily be controlled punching,
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.600]   but also biting behavior.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.680]   So it's remarkable to me at least that we have circuits
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.560]   in our brain that can evoke violent use of things
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.640]   like our mouth or violent use of things like our limbs
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.340]   that of course could be used for things like singing
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.600]   or kissing or eating or gesticulating
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.120]   in any kind of polite or impolite way.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.440]   The point here is that neural circuits,
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.180]   not individual brain areas, evoke the constellation
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.400]   of behaviors that we call aggression.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.800]   Now, many of you are probably puzzled
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.020]   or at least should be because I've been talking
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.800]   about this highly specialized brain area,
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.000]   the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.960]   and this highly specialized subcategory of neurons
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.240]   in the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.900]   these neurons that make estrogen receptor.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.840]   And yet the activation of those cells
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.580]   triggers dramatic and immediate aggression,
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.600]   both in males and in females,
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.280]   and both against males and against females.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.600]   So what's going on here?
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   Most of us think about estrogen
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.500]   and we don't immediately think of aggression.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.240]   Most of us hear testosterone
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.600]   and we might think about aggression,
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.100]   although other things as well.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.020]   In order to understand this,
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.560]   I just want to briefly refer back to a conversation
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.040]   that I had on a previous episode
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.240]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.920]   And that was with my colleague, the great Robert Sapolsky,
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.200]   of course, is a professor at Stanford
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.360]   who studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior,
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.860]   as well as estrogen and other hormones
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.360]   and their impacts on behavior.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   To make a long story short
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth,
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.000]   testosterone does not increase aggressiveness.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.840]   Testosterone increases proactivity
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.440]   and the willingness to lean into effort
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.420]   in competitive scenarios.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.840]   Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis,
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.660]   but to make a long story short,
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.480]   if people are given testosterone,
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.560]   or if you look at people who have different levels,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.600]   excuse me, of testosterone endogenously
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.080]   that they naturally make,
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.600]   what you'll find is that testosterone
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.840]   tends to increase competitiveness,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.320]   but not just in aggressive scenarios.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.360]   So if somebody is already aggressive,
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.740]   giving them testosterone will have the tendency
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.140]   to make them more aggressive.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:49.420]   If somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic,
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.400]   giving them testosterone
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.480]   will make them more benevolent and altruistic,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.680]   at least up to a point.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.240]   Now, of course, there are certain forms
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.520]   of synthetic testosterone that are known
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:03.040]   in sports circles and in other circles
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.720]   to increase aggressiveness
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.340]   because of the way those particular forms
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.080]   of synthetic testosterone work.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.560]   But in general, most of the experiments
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.140]   that I'm referring to have not been done using those.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.200]   They've been done using the,
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.640]   let's call them the more traditional
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.280]   biological forms of testosterone
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.740]   or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.660]   In fact, Robert Sapolsky described
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.040]   a really interesting experiment
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.360]   in which if you look at testosterone levels
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.460]   or you administer additional testosterone
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.640]   to people who are doing philanthropy,
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.520]   giving money to organizations,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.960]   and so they're essentially doing good
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.200]   because these are organizations doing good,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.180]   what you find is that increased testosterone
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.220]   or further increasing testosterone
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.740]   makes people more willing to compete
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.600]   to give more money than the other person in the room
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.140]   in order to put it in air quotes,
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.000]   to alpha out the other person by giving more money.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.680]   So this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.520]   It is not an act of aggression.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.040]   Of course, we don't know what the people
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.720]   are feeling underneath all that.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.240]   Again, we can't anthropomorphize
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.100]   or project onto other people what they're feeling.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.820]   But the point is that testosterone itself
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.800]   does not make people more aggressive.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.960]   And in the experiments that we've been talking about
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.480]   up until now, it's actually the activation
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.040]   of estrogen receptor containing neurons
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.220]   that makes these animals more aggressive.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.600]   And it turns out there's evidence that in certain contexts,
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.580]   estrogen can make people more aggressive.
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.780]   So what's going on here?
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.140]   Well, what's going on is that
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.500]   testosterone can be converted into estrogen
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.680]   through a process called aromatization.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.640]   There's an enzyme called aromatase.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.680]   Anytime you have a word that ends in A-S-E,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.400]   at least if it's in the context of biology,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.340]   it's almost always, not always, but almost always an enzyme.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.360]   So the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:54.200]   And it is actually testosterone aromatized,
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.980]   converted into estrogen,
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.300]   and then binding to these estrogen-containing neurons
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.460]   in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.300]   I want to repeat that.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.360]   It is not testosterone itself that triggers aggression.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.100]   It is testosterone aromatized into estrogen
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.680]   within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.140]   containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.100]   that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.680]   Now, this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.900]   is very robust, so much so that if you take a mouse
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.740]   that lacks the aromatase enzyme
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.120]   or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme,
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.380]   and they do exist,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.900]   then there is a reduction in overall aggression
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.940]   despite high levels of testosterone.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.940]   And if people who, or mice who have the aromatase enzyme
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.380]   have that enzyme blocked,
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.640]   well, then it doesn't matter
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.480]   how much you increase testosterone
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.440]   or any of its other derivatives.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.660]   You do not observe this aggression.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.020]   So this runs counter to everything that we know
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.280]   and think about the role of testosterone.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.340]   Again, testosterone increases competitiveness.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.800]   It can increase the desire to work under challenge.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.280]   I've said it before, and I ran this or pressure tested this
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.900]   against Robert Sapolsky, who's been working on testosterone
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.580]   and its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:25.040]   It is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.680]   of making effort feel good,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.660]   or at least increasing the threshold
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.860]   at which effort feels bad or unsustainable.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.480]   And it does that by way of changing the activity
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.980]   or the threshold for activation of brain structures
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.760]   like the amygdala and other brain structures
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.780]   associated with anxiety.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.480]   So the next time somebody says
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.120]   testosterone makes people aggressive,
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.460]   you can say, ah, no, actually it's estrogen
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.280]   that makes people aggressive
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.860]   and animals aggressive for that matter.
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.660]   Now, of course, it is the case
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:00.220]   that because males have relatively less estrogen
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.220]   circulating in their brain and body than females, right?
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.120]   Because they have testes, not ovaries,
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.440]   that testosterone is required in the first place
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.320]   in order to be converted into estrogen
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.620]   to activate this aggressive circuit
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.140]   involving these estrogen receptor-containing neurons
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.880]   and the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   But nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.440]   It is the hormone on which aggression hinges.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.700]   And I think for most people,
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.600]   that's a quite surprising finding.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.360]   And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.280]   in both the animal and human literature
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.420]   as it relates to hormones
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.560]   and psychological states and behavior.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.600]   Now, of course, it is the case that if testosterone is low,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.680]   that a person or an animal
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.000]   will exhibit less aggressive behavior,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.400]   but that's not because of reduced testosterone per se,
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.880]   it's because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone,
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.400]   meaning if there's no testosterone
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.360]   So we've established that it's not testosterone,
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.920]   but testosterone converted into estrogen
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.660]   that activates these circuits for aggression.
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.080]   But nonetheless, it's still surprising, right?
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.600]   I mean, most of us don't think about estrogen
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.440]   as the hormone that stimulates aggression,
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.280]   but turns out it's all contextual.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.760]   There are beautiful data
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.120]   showing that whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.620]   can be powerfully modulated
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.760]   by whether or not days are short or days are long.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.000]   In other words, whether or not
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.280]   there's a lot of sunshine or not.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.800]   Now, obviously brain is encased in skull,
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.320]   so it doesn't really know
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.640]   if there's a lot of sunshine out there,
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.160]   even though you can see the sun with your eyes,
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.360]   you can feel it on your skin.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.880]   Day length is converted into hormonal signals
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.800]   and chemical signals,
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.000]   and the primary hormonal and chemical signals
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.740]   involve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.720]   So to make a very long story short,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.880]   in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight,
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.320]   both in our eyes and on our skin,
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.000]   melatonin levels are reduced.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.920]   Melatonin is a hormone
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.580]   that tends to produce states of sleepiness and quiescence.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.120]   It also tends to activate pathways
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.680]   that tend to reduce things like breeding
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.560]   and sexual behavior.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.080]   In long days, dopamine is increased.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.600]   Dopamine is a molecule associated
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.860]   with feelings of wellbeing and motivation,
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.320]   and the desire to seek out all sorts of things,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.180]   all sorts of motivated behaviors.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.020]   And in long days,
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.760]   provided we're getting enough sunlight on our skin
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.940]   and to our eyes, the stress hormones,
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.740]   especially cortisol and some of the other stress hormones
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.920]   are reduced in levels.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:45.760]   If estrogen levels are increased experimentally
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.980]   under long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.280]   However, in short days, if estrogen is increased,
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.240]   there's a heightened predisposition for aggression.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.420]   And that makes perfect sense
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.380]   if you think about what short days do
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.500]   to the biology of your brain and body.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.300]   In short days, the melatonin signal goes up.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.740]   There's more melatonin circulating
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.700]   for more of each 24 hour cycle.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.440]   Stress hormones are circulating more.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.280]   Why?
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.240]   Short days tend to be associated with winter.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.500]   In winter, we are bombarded with more bacteria and viruses
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   because bacteria and viruses actually survive better in cold
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.600]   than they do in heat.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.760]   In fact, in my laboratory, we work with a lot of viruses
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.380]   and bacteria, and when we want to keep them alive,
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.600]   we put them in the freezer.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   If we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them,
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.120]   we put them under UV light,
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.720]   like you would see from the sunlight.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.680]   So shorter days are conducive to aggression,
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.620]   not because days are short per se,
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.800]   but because stress hormone levels are higher
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.520]   and because dopamine levels are lower.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.900]   Now here's where all of this starts to converge
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.320]   on a very clear biological picture,
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.200]   a very clear psychological picture,
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.800]   and indeed a very clear set of tools
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.580]   that we can think about and use.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.380]   Under conditions where cortisol is high,
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.360]   where the stress hormone is elevated,
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.840]   and under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.680]   is reduced, there is a greater propensity
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.020]   for estrogen to trigger aggression.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.480]   Now, again, I know I've said it before,
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.660]   but for males who make a lot of testosterone
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.880]   relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.380]   this idea that if testosterone is high,
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.800]   that means that estrogen is low,
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.360]   because while that can be true in the periphery in the body,
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.240]   if testosterone is high,
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.320]   there is going to be some aromatization,
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.240]   that conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.520]   So anytime you hear that testosterone is high,
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.160]   you should think testosterone is high in the body
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.740]   and perhaps estrogen is low in the body,
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.640]   but that means that there's going to be heightened levels
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.400]   of estrogen in the brain,
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.520]   and therefore increased propensity for aggression.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.540]   In females who generally make less testosterone
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.960]   relative to estrogen,
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.800]   there is sufficient estrogen already present
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.660]   to trigger aggression.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:06.280]   So both males and females are primed for aggression,
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.220]   but that's riding on a context,
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:12.040]   and that context of whether or not you get a tendency
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.880]   for aggression or not,
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.320]   depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low,
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.760]   and I'm telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.820]   in any individual, there's going to be a tilt,
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.240]   an increase in that hydraulic pressure
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.440]   that Lorenz talked about toward aggression.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:33.520]   And if serotonin, the neuromodulator
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.880]   that is associated with feelings of wellbeing,
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.160]   and sometimes even of slight passivity,
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   but certainly of wellbeing,
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.480]   if serotonin is low,
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.620]   there's also going to be a further shift
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.300]   towards an aggressive tendency.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.060]   So if we return to Lorenz's hydraulic pressure model
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.860]   of aggression and other internal states,
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.620]   we realize that external stimuli,
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.900]   things that we hear, things that we see,
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.860]   for instance, someone saying something upsetting
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.020]   or us seeing somebody do something
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.660]   that we don't like to others or to us,
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.920]   as well as our internal state,
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.020]   our subjective feelings of wellbeing,
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.400]   but also our stress level,
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.280]   our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.100]   and are content with what we have,
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.840]   all of that is converging on this thing
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.280]   that we call internal state and creating this pressure
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.660]   of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.020]   And now we have some major players
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.100]   feeding into that final pathway,
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.360]   that question of whether or not,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.680]   will we hit the other person?
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.160]   Will we say the thing that is considered aggressive?
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.640]   Will we not say it?
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.620]   If somebody says something or does something aggressive
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.880]   to us, will we respond or will we be submissive
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.500]   or even passive?
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.620]   Again, there are many things funneling into that question
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.160]   and dictating whether or not the answer is,
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.540]   absolutely, I'll fight back,
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.900]   or I'm going to attack them even unprovoked,
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.020]   or if they say this, I'm going to do that,
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:57.100]   or no matter what they do, I'm not going to respond.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.020]   These kinds of things are very complex
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.980]   and yet we really can boil them down
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.540]   to just a few common elements.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.100]   And I'm telling you that those elements
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.020]   are whether or not cortisol levels
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.420]   are relatively lower or relatively higher.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.280]   Again, relatively higher is going to tend
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.680]   to make people more reactive, why?
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.100]   Because reactivity is really a function
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.940]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.060]   which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.100]   between the so-called sympathetic arm
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.140]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.160]   which tends to put us into a state of readiness
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.680]   through the release of adrenaline.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.940]   Cortisol and adrenaline,
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.580]   when they're circulating in the brain and body,
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.740]   make us more likely to move and to react and to speak.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.300]   It's actually what will induce a kind of low level tremor,
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.840]   which is an anticipatory tremor
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.860]   to be able to move more quickly, right?
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.020]   The body in motion is more easily set into further motion,
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:44.860]   that is.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:50.020]   And the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.860]   that in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.400]   in response to what we already have.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.260]   So when we are well-fed,
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.500]   serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body,
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.560]   in particular, well-fed with carbohydrates.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.360]   The precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.240]   And indeed, there are nice studies exploring
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.400]   the types of diets, nutritional programs,
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.280]   that can reduce aggressive behavior,
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.140]   both in children and in adults.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.780]   And tryptophan-rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:24.240]   So for tryptophan-rich diets, things like white turkey meat,
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.900]   but then there are also a number of carbohydrates.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.340]   You can look up, it's very easy to find,
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.380]   foods that contain lots of tryptophan.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.940]   Those foods contain the precursor to serotonin.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.140]   Now, it isn't simply the case that eating more foods
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.980]   with tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.780]   I suppose it could do that if you ate it in abundance,
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   it could make you tired,
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.660]   and then you're less likely to be aggressive.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.700]   I don't recommend that strategy.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:51.700]   But the idea here is that when it's been explored,
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.540]   increasing levels of tryptophan,
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.540]   either by supplementation or by food,
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:59.100]   or drugs, prescription drugs that increase serotonin,
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.560]   so for instance, fluoxetine, sometimes called Prozac
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.880]   or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs,
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.780]   tend to reduce aggressive behavior.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.900]   Now, not always, but in general, that's the case.
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.260]   Similarly, because elevated cortisol
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.380]   tends to shift the whole system, again,
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.080]   create more of a hydraulic pressure
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.560]   towards aggressive states.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.700]   If cortisol levels are reduced,
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.820]   well, then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.060]   This is supported by a number of peer-reviewed studies.
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.380]   We'll provide links to some of those
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.540]   in the caption show notes.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.900]   And we're going to return to these a bit later
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:30.660]   in the context of specific studies
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.340]   that have looked at genetic variants in different individuals
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.100]   that cause them to make more or less serotonin,
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.620]   or at least to metabolize serotonin differently.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.460]   This is also the case
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.940]   for so-called intermittent explosive disorder
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.060]   that can often be associated with gene variants
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.380]   that control how much serotonin is made
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.560]   or how it's metabolized or how much cortisol is made
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.460]   and how much it's metabolized.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.460]   In thinking about tools,
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.160]   there are a number of things that one could consider.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:03.020]   First of all, there are a number of decent studies
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.620]   exploring how supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:11.620]   which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems,
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.540]   including serotonin, that can modulate,
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:18.860]   not directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.920]   Supplementation with the omega-3s has been shown
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.660]   to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contexts
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.420]   in things like ADHD or in individuals
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.780]   who have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.380]   or aggressive thinking.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.220]   Now, that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.180]   that the omega-3 fatty acids are going directly
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.560]   to the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.480]   and changing the activity of neurons there.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:43.300]   More likely, they are causing or modulating
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:47.580]   an overall shift in mood through the immune system,
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.880]   through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.620]   or the propensity for neurons
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.880]   in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.020]   How much omega-3 fatty acid, what source?
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.440]   Well, we've talked about this on the podcast before.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.300]   You can, of course, get omega-3 fatty acids
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.440]   from a number of different foods.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.740]   Getting them from whole foods
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.480]   is probably the best way to do it.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.060]   But many people, including people with depression,
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.600]   will often supplement with one gram or more
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.540]   of omega-3 fatty acids per day.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.980]   Some people, including myself, will take them every day
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.060]   as just a general mood enhancer.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.220]   I don't suffer from depression,
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.420]   but I've found it to be beneficial for my health.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.760]   And so some people will do that.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.740]   And I've talked about before
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.860]   how in double-blind placebo-controlled studies,
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.760]   people taking one to three grams of omega-3 fatty acids
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.000]   per day, typically in the form of a high-quality fish oil,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.800]   although there are other sources as well,
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.840]   algae and so forth,
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:40.460]   can experience improvements in mood
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.000]   that are on par with some of the SSRIs,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.920]   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.740]   And of course, if you are prescribed an SSRI
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.240]   by your psychiatrist or other doctor,
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.620]   please do take that and don't cease to take it,
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.320]   just simply to take omega-3s.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.860]   However, you might mention to them,
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.400]   and you can find links to the studies
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.400]   in our previous episodes on depression,
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.060]   that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:05.080]   at this one gram or more of EPA specifically,
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.820]   so getting above that one gram threshold
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.920]   as high as three grams per day of the EPA
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.520]   has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.480]   and still keep their mood in a place
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.160]   that's beneficial for them.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.600]   And in terms of keeping cortisol in a range
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.540]   that's healthy and doesn't bias someone
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.940]   toward high levels of aggression and irritability,
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.780]   that's again going to be set
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.160]   by a number of larger modulators or contextual cues.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.780]   And I've talked about some of those on the podcast,
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.940]   but I'll just briefly recap them now.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.000]   Obviously getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.080]   and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.120]   throughout the day is going to be important.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:48.460]   Again, because of this effect of estrogen in long days,
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.560]   not increasing aggression.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.520]   However, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.860]   because of the increase in cortisol
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.780]   observed in short days.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.680]   Another way to reduce cortisol was discussed
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.780]   in our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat,
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:04.820]   but also hot baths.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.400]   It turns out that hot baths and sauna
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.600]   can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.960]   All the details on that are included
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.600]   in the episode on heat and its timestamp,
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.120]   so you can go directly to that
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.540]   if you want to learn about the temperatures
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.660]   and the various durations,
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.320]   but to just give a synopsis of that,
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.400]   a 20 minute sauna at anywhere
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.760]   from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.900]   is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.280]   If you don't have access to a sauna,
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.080]   you could do a hot bath,
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.840]   adjust the temperature so you don't burn yourself.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.720]   I think, you know, 80 to 100 degrees Celsius
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.140]   is going to be too hot for many people if it's a hot bath,
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:42.160]   whereas many people who can't tolerate that hot bath
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.180]   can tolerate the sauna.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:46.000]   So safety first, always, and of course,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.400]   but hot baths reduce cortisol.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.240]   Hot saunas reduce cortisol of a duration
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.420]   about 20 or 30 minutes is going to be beneficial.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.040]   And of course, some of you may be interested
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.520]   in exploring the supplementation route
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.700]   and for reductions in cortisol,
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.160]   really the chief player there is ashwagandha,
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.800]   which is known to decrease cortisol fairly potently.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.200]   I should just warn you that if you're going to use ashwagandha
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.320]   in order to reduce cortisol,
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.800]   first of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.520]   before adding or subtracting anything
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.360]   from your supplementation or health regimen.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.980]   Of course, I don't just say that to protect us.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.120]   I say that to protect you.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.100]   You are responsible for your health.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.040]   What you take and what you don't take.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.080]   Chronic supplementation with ashwagandha
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.300]   can have some not so great effects of disruption
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.060]   of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways.
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.540]   So the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.300]   before you'd want to take a break of about two weeks.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.920]   So ashwagandha, again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol,
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.340]   but with some other effects as well,
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.400]   don't use it chronically for longer than two weeks.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.480]   But if your goal is to reduce cortisol,
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.580]   let's say you're going through a period
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.720]   of increased irritability and aggressive tendency,
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:54.680]   maybe you're also not getting
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.280]   as much light as you would like.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.040]   And perhaps also if there are other circumstantial things
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.400]   leading you towards more aggressiveness
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.340]   and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness,
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.160]   that can be potentially helpful.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.920]   And in light of all this stuff about cortisol
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.920]   and estrogen and day length,
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.200]   I should mention that there are in fact,
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.200]   some people who have a genetic predisposition
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.880]   to be more irritable and aggressive.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.900]   And there are a couple of different gene pathways
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.100]   associated with this.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.340]   We never like to think about just one gene
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.540]   causing a specific behavior.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.620]   The way to think about genes is that genes generally code
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.620]   for things within our biology
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.040]   in the context of today's discussion,
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.860]   things like neural circuits
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.260]   or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:40.720]   or the amounts of hormones that are made
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.320]   or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.280]   or enzymes, et cetera,
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.540]   that shift the activity of our biology
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.440]   in a particular direction.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.600]   They bias our biology.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.320]   And in fact, there is a genetic variant
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.160]   present in certain people
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.200]   that adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.120]   And that estrogen receptor sensitivity
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.340]   can result in increased levels of aggression,
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.320]   sometimes dramatic increases.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.180]   However, and also very interestingly,
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.840]   photoperiod, meaning day length,
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.820]   is a strong modulator of whether or not
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.920]   that aggressiveness turns up or not.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.080]   Whether or not that person with the particular gene variant
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:28.720]   is more aggressive or not depends on how long the day is
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.300]   and how long the night is.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:33.080]   One particular study that I like that references this
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.300]   is Treynor et al.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.480]   The title of the study is photoperiod
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.420]   reverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.660]   via genomic and non-genomic pathways.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.520]   This was a paper published in the Proceedings
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.340]   of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.520]   We'll put a reference to this in the show notes
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.240]   if you'd like to explore it further.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.860]   But it really points to the fact that rarely,
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.300]   sometimes, but rarely is it the case
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.860]   that just one gene will cause somebody
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.180]   to be hyper-aggressive.
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.240]   Almost always, there's going to be an interplay
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.080]   between genetics and environment.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   And as environment changes, such as day length changes
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.520]   and the length of night changes,
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.640]   so too will the tendency for people
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.620]   with a given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.340]   Now, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.460]   for this particular estrogen receptor variant,
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:21.140]   most people, I'm guessing you,
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.540]   are probably not walking around knowing
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:24.900]   that you have this gene or not.
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:28.820]   Regardless, I think it's important to pay attention
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.140]   to how you feel at different times of year,
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.040]   depending on whether or not it's summer,
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.880]   whether or not it's winter,
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.180]   whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight,
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.140]   meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not,
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:40.160]   whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight exposure
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.280]   to your skin or not,
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.900]   whether or not you're indoors all the time.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.300]   Generally, those things correlate with season,
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:47.540]   but not always.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:50.240]   You can go through long bouts of hard work
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.900]   in the summer months when days are long,
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.920]   but you're indoors a lot
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.700]   and getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:55.540]   late in the evening,
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.660]   and perhaps that's when you're feeling more aggressive.
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:58.900]   So we have to be careful about drawing
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.460]   a one-to-one relationship between any biological feature
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.900]   and certainly psychological or behavioral feature
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.000]   like aggressiveness.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.020]   But it's, I believe, helpful to know
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:11.980]   that these genetic biases exist, how they play out.
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.380]   Again, they shift our biology
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.660]   in a general thematic direction.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.740]   They don't change one thing.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.360]   They change a variety of things that bias us toward or away
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.100]   from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.700]   and the various things that we can do
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.300]   in order to offset them.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.900]   We described those earlier in terms of trying
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.100]   to keep cortisol low by getting sufficient sunlight
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.700]   regardless of time of year
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.740]   and regardless of whether or not you happen
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.680]   to have this particular genetic variant.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.740]   So earlier I talked about how it is testosterone converted
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.180]   into estrogen that's activating aggression
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.520]   in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.520]   However, there are some studies carried out in humans
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.340]   that have evaluated the effects of testosterone
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.660]   and how levels of testosterone correlate
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.180]   with aggressiveness in the short term.
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.960]   I'm just going to detail a few of those studies
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.980]   because I think they are interesting and important.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.660]   First of all, there is a study that has explored levels
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:09.020]   of testosterone in men of different professions.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.460]   Now, before I tell you the data,
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.160]   I want to be very clear here.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.700]   With a study such as this,
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.600]   one never knows whether or not these men went
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.180]   into a particular profession
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.980]   because they had a testosterone level of a given value
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.420]   or whether or not the work itself altered
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.300]   their testosterone levels or both.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.320]   And I think it's fair to assume that it's probably both.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.020]   So be very careful in assuming
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.980]   that a given testosterone level is causal
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.380]   for choosing a particular career
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.420]   or that a particular career is causal
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.260]   for creating a particular testosterone level.
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:49.460]   This study used salivary testosterone levels
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:52.100]   as the measure, which to be fair,
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.260]   is not the best way to measure testosterone.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.180]   Typically, blood draw would be the best way
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.460]   to measure testosterone, but nonetheless,
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.760]   provided the appropriate methods are used,
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.060]   salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.800]   of testosterone.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.100]   The different occupations that were looked at
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.100]   were, and here they just looked at men
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.820]   in this particular study, were ministers,
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.300]   salesmen, they didn't say what particular types of salesmen,
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.420]   firemen, professors of all things,
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.740]   physicians and NFL players.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:26.300]   And what they discovered was that the testosterone levels
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.380]   were essentially in that order from low to highest.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.700]   So minister, salesman, fireman, professor,
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.000]   physician, NFL player.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.500]   Now we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.300]   and all the different features of each of these jobs.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.280]   For instance, we don't know whether or not the fact
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.140]   that the firemen happened, at least in this study,
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.640]   to have lower testosterone levels on average
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.600]   than the professors or the physicians
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.020]   was because firemen have lower testosterone levels
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.960]   or because they have a much more stressful job
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.260]   and their cortisol levels are higher
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.120]   than the professor or the physician.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.480]   And cortisol and testosterone, not always,
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.680]   but generally are in somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.740]   because they derive from the same precursor, et cetera.
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.180]   Typically when cortisol is high,
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.460]   testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.180]   So we don't know what's causing these effects.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:21.200]   And again, this is just one study and just six occupations,
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.180]   but I think it's relatively interesting given the fact
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.180]   that each of these professions involves different levels
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.380]   of competitiveness, right?
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.620]   So we don't necessarily just want to think about the level
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.500]   of physical exertion that's required,
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.280]   but also the level of competitiveness
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.740]   because it's known that competitive interactions
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.900]   can cause increases in testosterone in particular
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.900]   in the winners of competitive interactions,
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.260]   a topic for a future podcast.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.980]   Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed also, again,
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.100]   salivary testosterone in prisoners,
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.360]   in this case, female prisoners,
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.400]   so these are incarcerated individuals,
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.740]   have looked at levels of testosterone
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.620]   according to whether or not the person committed
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:06.280]   a nonviolent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.940]   and higher levels of salivary testosterone
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:13.780]   were related to those that had arrived in prison
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.740]   because of conviction of a violent crime
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.580]   as opposed to a nonviolent crime.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.780]   Likewise, when they analyze prison rule violations,
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.260]   so an indirect measure of aggressiveness,
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.660]   but in this case, it was strongly associated
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.700]   with aggressiveness because they knew
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.260]   what the violations were.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.060]   They found where for prisoners that had none,
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.460]   no prison violations, prison rule violations,
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:39.520]   I should say their testosterone levels tended to be lower
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.860]   than the testosterone levels of women that had some,
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:47.860]   even one or more aggressive violations of prison rules.
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.440]   We'll provide links to these studies in the show notes
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.480]   if you'd like to go into them further.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.340]   Obviously, studies like this need to be taken
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:56.220]   with a grain of salt
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.460]   because there are so many different factors,
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.860]   different prisons have different degrees of violence
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.460]   to begin with and competitiveness to begin with.
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.980]   But just as a final pass at examining the role
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.380]   between testosterone and aggressiveness,
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:13.580]   there was a very interesting study from Gotz et al.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.580]   G-O-E-T-Z published in 2014 that looked at serum,
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.340]   so in this case, blood levels of testosterone,
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:26.620]   30 minutes after application of a gel-based testosterone
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.780]   that goes transdermal so that the testosterone
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.540]   can go very quickly into the bloodstream
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.820]   and then did brain imaging to evaluate the activity
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.860]   of neurons in the so-called corticomedial amygdala.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:41.540]   The medial amygdala is one of the areas
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.420]   of the amygdala complex, as we call it,
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.220]   because it's complex, it's got a lot of different nuclei.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.260]   You now know what nuclei are, little clusters of neurons.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.240]   It's got a lot of different ones,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.980]   but that medial and that corticomedial amygdala
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.300]   in particular is known to be associated
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.260]   with aggressive type behaviors.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.980]   It's linked up with, it's part of the larger circuit
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.780]   that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.540]   and other brain areas that we referred to earlier,
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.900]   such as the PAG.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.260]   What is remarkable about this study is that it showed
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.120]   that just 30 minutes after application
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.380]   of this so-called androgel,
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.980]   this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream,
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:21.120]   there was a significant increase in, of course, testosterone
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:25.380]   and corticomedial amygdala activation.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.320]   So testosterone can have acute effects, immediate effects,
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.240]   on the pathways related to aggression.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.620]   And I think this is something that's not often discussed
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.280]   because many of the effects of steroid hormones,
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.640]   like testosterone and estrogen, are very slow acting.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.320]   In fact, steroid hormones,
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.920]   because they have a certain biochemical composition,
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.260]   can actually pass through the membranes of cells,
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:48.660]   so the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.700]   and change gene expression in the cell.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.520]   You think about puberty,
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.020]   the kid that goes home for the summer
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.120]   and then comes back looking completely different.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.240]   Well, that's because a lot of genes got turned on
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.700]   by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen,
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.480]   but the steroid hormones can also
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.020]   have very fast acting effects.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.780]   And with testosterone in particular,
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.880]   those can be remarkably fast acting.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.700]   And one of the most apparent
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.180]   and well-documented fast acting effects is this effect,
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.200]   the ability to activate cells within the amygdala.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.040]   So you might say, well,
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.740]   I thought the amygdala was associated with fear.
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.340]   Wouldn't testosterone then cause fear?
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:25.020]   No, turns out that the amygdala harbors both cortisol,
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.840]   corticosterone receptors, and testosterone receptors,
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.840]   and they each adjust the activity
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.640]   in the amygdala differently,
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:36.120]   such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.080]   for inducing states of mind and body
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.940]   that are more action-based.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.920]   And indeed, in animals and in humans,
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.840]   testosterone application and activation
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.760]   of this corticomedial amygdala pathway
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.080]   will make animals and humans lean into effort.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.520]   This is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good,
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.380]   or at least biases the organism toward leaning
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.340]   into challenge.
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.660]   So if you recall, there's not just one type of aggression.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.660]   There's reactive aggression,
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.500]   which is triggered when one is confronted with something
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.580]   that sometimes is inevitable, right?
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.940]   One needs to fight for their life
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:09.540]   or for somebody else's life,
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.340]   but also proactive aggression.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.780]   And proactive aggression involves activation
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.100]   of those go pathways in the basal ganglia
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.100]   and a leaning into effort to overcome
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.020]   whatever state one happens to be in to begin with.
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.560]   And so this is very important because it points to the fact
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.560]   that yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.580]   that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.300]   but it's very likely the case
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.180]   that testosterone is acting to accelerate
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.100]   or to bias states of mind and body
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.540]   toward those that will lead to aggression.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.140]   Again, aggression is not like a switch on and off.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.060]   It's a process.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.620]   It has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.300]   Remember that hydraulic pressure
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.960]   that Konrad Lorenz hypothesized?
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.460]   Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.400]   toward an aggressive episode
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.580]   and then estrogen actually triggering
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.400]   that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.980]   So if somebody tells you that testosterone,
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.760]   endogenous or exogenous, makes people aggressive,
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.980]   tell them no.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.120]   Testosterone tends to make people lean into effort.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.360]   And if that effort involves being aggressive,
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.280]   either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.660]   well, then it will indeed lead to aggression,
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.180]   but the actual aggression itself
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.380]   is triggered by estrogen, not testosterone.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.580]   Now, thus far, we really haven't talked too much
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.660]   about the social context in which aggression occurs.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.500]   And that's because there is a near infinite,
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.340]   if not infinite number of variables that will determine that.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:44.220]   So for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.100]   at a professional boxing match
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.300]   provided it's occurring inside the ring
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.220]   and only between the competitors
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:55.220]   and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.140]   However, there are some things
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.020]   that tend to bias certain social contexts
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.200]   toward being more aggressive or less aggressive
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.460]   and not always physical aggression.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.260]   And those generally come in two forms
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.560]   that many of you are familiar with,
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.820]   which are alcohol and caffeine.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.020]   Let's discuss caffeine first.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:18.300]   Why would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity?
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.380]   Well, the general effects of caffeine
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.200]   are to increase autonomic arousal,
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.100]   the activity of the so-called sympathetic arm
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.840]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.660]   which is, to put it very much in plain language,
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.360]   it's the alertness arm of your nervous system.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.100]   That is, it creates a sense of readiness
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.420]   in your brain and body.
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.000]   And it does so by activating
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.860]   the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.260]   Again, as I always remind people,
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.660]   simpa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.660]   Simpa means together or all at once.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:54.180]   And caffeine tends to bias our brain and body
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.300]   to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.500]   which run from about the base of your neck
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.160]   until the top of your pelvis,
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.280]   and deploy a bunch of chemicals
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.860]   that jut out into the rest of your body,
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.580]   activate adrenaline release.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.140]   There's a parallel increase of adrenaline in your brain,
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.500]   creating the state of alertness and readiness.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.900]   That state of alertness and readiness
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.900]   can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:19.100]   However, when we are in a state
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.860]   of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert,
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:25.180]   such as after drinking caffeine,
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.400]   we will bias all those brain and body systems,
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.280]   the hormones, the chemicals, et cetera,
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.360]   that exist toward action as opposed to inaction.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.840]   So put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.020]   No surprise there.
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.540]   On the opposite end of things,
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:46.020]   alcohol tends to decrease activity
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.260]   in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.020]   tends to make us feel less alert.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:52.580]   Now, initially it can create a state of alertness
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.180]   because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain.
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:58.040]   Our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.920]   has what's called top-down inhibition.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.060]   It exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.820]   on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus,
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:08.020]   such as the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.100]   The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.460]   is able to rationalize and think clearly
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:15.940]   and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathways
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.480]   telling you don't say that mean thing,
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.740]   don't do that violent thing, et cetera.
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.920]   Alcohol initially tends to increase
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.780]   our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition,
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.200]   not just in that forebrain circuit,
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.200]   but in other circuits, tends to make us more active.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.060]   We tend to talk more than we normally would,
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.660]   move more than we normally would,
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:39.580]   but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.380]   by way of reducing activity in the forebrain,
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.980]   releasing some of the deeper brain circuits
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.540]   that are involved in impulsivity,
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:51.120]   but also causing a somewhat sedative effect.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:51.960]   And then of course,
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.080]   as alcohol levels increase even further,
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.020]   people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.900]   So what we've got with alcohol and caffeine
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.940]   is we've got two opposite ends of the spectrum,
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.780]   caffeine increasing arousal and readiness
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.540]   and the tendency for impulsivity,
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.820]   and alcohol also increasing impulsivity,
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.800]   but through a different mechanism.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.180]   A really interesting study,
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.140]   and I should just mention that the title of the study
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.900]   is Caffeinated and Non-Caffeinated Alcohol Use
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:23.820]   and Indirect Aggression, the Impact of Self-regulation.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.940]   So the title is almost self-explanatory.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.700]   This was a paper published in the Journal
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.260]   of Addictive Behavior in 2016,
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:34.180]   examining how ingestion of alcohol
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:38.020]   that's either caffeinated or non-caffeinated alcohol drinks
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.860]   impacted what they call indirect aggression.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.760]   And just to remind you what indirect aggression is,
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.820]   these are not physical acts of aggression,
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.480]   these are verbal acts of aggression.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.080]   So embarrassing others,
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.740]   or otherwise somehow trying to reduce
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.380]   the wellbeing of others by saying certain things,
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.060]   in particular, in groups.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.700]   This study examined both males and females.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.180]   This was done by way of a college campus study.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.720]   Subjects were 18 to 47 years old.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.320]   I guess there's some older students on that campus,
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.580]   or maybe they use some non-students,
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.400]   but these days you've also got some students
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.060]   that are in their 30s and 40s.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:15.200]   So they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included,
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.020]   fairly broad racial background as well,
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.520]   included not at equal numbers,
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.220]   but at least they included a pretty broad spectrum
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.740]   of people with different backgrounds.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.260]   They looked in particular at people
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.020]   that ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.620]   at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.140]   Okay, again, this is a college campus,
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.140]   not that I encourage that.
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.340]   I'm one of these people that I've never really liked,
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.440]   drugs or alcohol, and since we're fortunate in that way,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.700]   I can drink or not drink and tend to not drink.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:47.580]   But so to me, 9.18 drinks per week sounds like a lot,
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.300]   but I know for some people that might actually be typical.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.620]   And then others who were drinking
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:56.820]   at least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week,
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.940]   and those individuals end as high, I should say,
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:04.380]   as 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.480]   So this would be energy drinks
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.140]   combined typically with hard alcohol
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.840]   that's fairly commonly available in bars and so forth.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.460]   And some individuals drank as much as, goodness,
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.680]   20.36 alcoholic drinks per week total,
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.620]   some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.500]   The basic outcome of this study was that
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.740]   the more alcohol someone tended to consume,
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.540]   the more likely it was that they would engage
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:31.820]   in these indirect aggressive type behaviors.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.520]   And in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.160]   there the effect was especially interesting.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.420]   Here I'm just going to paraphrase,
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.780]   or I'll actually read from the study.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.200]   Quote, "With regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use,
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.100]   our findings indicated that heavier
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.920]   caffeinated alcohol beverage use
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.420]   was associated positively with indirect aggression
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.880]   even after considering one's typical alcohol use
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.900]   and dispositional aggression."
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.460]   What this means is that even though alcohol
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive,
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.660]   and even though certain individuals
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.740]   already have a disposition toward being more aggressive,
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.620]   there was an effect that was independent,
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:11.300]   meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition,
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.480]   meaning if someone was consuming
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.260]   caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:18.100]   they had a particularly high likelihood
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.380]   of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.860]   Now, this makes perfect sense in light of the model
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.340]   they propose, which is this self-regulation model
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.580]   that basically self-regulation involves several things.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.060]   It involves engaging in certain behaviors
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.420]   and suppressing other behaviors.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.220]   So as described before,
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.100]   because alcohol tends to have a sedative,
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.660]   suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system,
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.340]   at least after the initial period,
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:47.860]   it's going to tend to reduce the likelihood
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.540]   that people will engage in any type of behavior,
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.060]   whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.580]   and increase the likelihood that someone will engage
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:58.920]   in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.340]   So the combination of caffeine and alcohol
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:03.740]   is really acting as a two-prong system
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.300]   to bias people towards more impulsivity,
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.820]   that is less self-regulation.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.940]   So it's really yanking your volitional control,
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:14.280]   your ability to engage in prefrontal top-down inhibition
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.920]   over your hypothalamus from two distinct
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.020]   and specific circuits.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.660]   By now, you should be getting the impression
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:22.300]   that self-regulation is a key feature
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.420]   of whether or not somebody, maybe even you,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.260]   is going to engage in aggressive speech
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.500]   or aggressive behavior.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:29.820]   And we've talked about a number of tools
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.780]   that one can use to reduce the probability
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.320]   that that will happen.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.340]   I suppose if the context were appropriate,
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.380]   you could even take those two recommendations
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.900]   and just invert them and increase the likelihood
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.460]   that aggressiveness would happen.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.980]   But regardless, self-regulation is key.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:49.780]   And in light of that, I want to share with you a study
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:54.780]   that's focused on kids, but that has important ramifications
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.220]   for adults as well.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:00.060]   As you probably are already aware,
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.980]   there are many kids out there that suffer
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.580]   from so-called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.600]   ADHD.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.340]   There are also many adults we are finding
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.140]   that are suffering from ADHD.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.400]   And there's also an epidemic, I would say,
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.720]   of people that are concerned
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.500]   about whether or not they have ADHD.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.640]   Now, whether or not they have true clinical ADHD or not
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.500]   is not clear.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.840]   We did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.500]   I would encourage you to check out that episode
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.820]   and some of the diagnostic criteria.
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.020]   If you have the opportunity,
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:30.340]   you can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:34.380]   As this study I'm about to share with you aptly points out,
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.980]   there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:40.580]   There's no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:44.880]   Whether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.900]   on a number of different cognitive tests
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.880]   and behavioral tests and self-report.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.280]   In any event, the study I'm about to share with you
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.520]   explored how a particular pattern of supplementation
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.240]   in kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.440]   and impulsivity and increase self-regulation.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.340]   And the title of the study is efficacy of carnitine
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.440]   in the treatment of children
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.120]   with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.000]   Even though they put carnitine in the title,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.620]   that what they focused on was
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:17.040]   whether or not acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.660]   could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.280]   of these kids with ADHD.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.400]   And to make a long story short, indeed, it did.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.880]   There was a very significant effect
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.000]   of acetyl-carnitine supplementation
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.780]   on improving some of the symptomology of ADHD.
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:36.660]   A few details about the study that might be relevant to you.
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.840]   This was a randomized double blind placebo controlled
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.560]   double crossover study.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.620]   This was done as an outpatient study.
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:44.200]   So the kids weren't in a hospital.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.520]   They were living out in the world.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.320]   This again was done on younger kids.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.760]   So this was six to 13 year old kids
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.460]   that were diagnosed with ADHD.
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:58.460]   They received either acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:02.640]   And they did all the good practice stuff
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.280]   that good researchers do of making sure
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.720]   that the placebo and the acetyl-L-carnitine
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.840]   had similar look and taste.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.840]   It was consumed twice daily after meals.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.400]   Now she just mentioned that acetyl-L-carnitine
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.200]   typically is taken in capsule form
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.240]   or occasionally an injectable form here.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.680]   They were using this as a drink,
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.480]   which essentially the same as capsule form,
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.920]   but the powder is just going directly into liquid.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.920]   And the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.760]   So they're doing this according to the body weight
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.280]   of these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.080]   The quantity of the medication was supplied.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.860]   Here I'm reading for a period of eight weeks.
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:38.700]   And every eight weeks,
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.280]   a new quantity of medication was supplied.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.360]   So basically this is a fairly long-term study
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.240]   exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.720]   in week eight, 16, and 24.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.240]   They also looked at things
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.840]   that you could only get through a blood draw.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.740]   So things like hemoglobin, hematocrit,
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.840]   red blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:20:59.680]   These are kids.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.040]   And even if it were adults,
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.600]   they were quite appropriately examining
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.000]   a lot of the physiological measures
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.280]   that one would want to carry out to make sure, first of all,
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.840]   that blood levels of carnitine are increasing
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.900]   and indeed they confirm that,
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:15.180]   but also that no negative effects are showing up
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.900]   in the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids.
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:20.000]   So first I'll just tell you the basic outcome of the study,
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.760]   which was here I'm paraphrasing.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.880]   Given twice daily, carnitine appeared to be effective
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.980]   in well-tolerated treatment
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.960]   for a group of children with ADHD.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.460]   They showed significant abnormal behavior
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.680]   compared to these other boys.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.100]   And now I'm moving to the table of results.
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:36.680]   They showed significant reductions
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.960]   in their so-called total problem score.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.120]   The total problem score is a well-established measure
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.480]   of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.440]   And I should say adults with ADHD has to do with challenges
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.920]   in social and learning environments
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:56.080]   and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.040]   Reductions in attentional problems overall,
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.320]   reductions in delinquency,
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.920]   and most important for sake of today's discussion,
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.700]   significant reductions in aggressive behavior.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.020]   Now, what's especially nice about this study I think
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.380]   is that even though it's a relatively small number
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:13.060]   of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:16.020]   in other studies and other laboratories,
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:21.020]   that they were able to confirm the shifts in L-carnitine
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.400]   within the bloodstream of these kids.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.760]   That is, they were able to correlate the physiology
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.000]   with the psychological changes.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.360]   In studies like this,
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.840]   and frankly in all studies of human pharmacology,
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.700]   you have to worry about effects that show up
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.560]   not just because of placebo effects,
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.620]   but because of so-called off-target effects
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.320]   or related things totally independent of the drug
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.360]   or the particular supplement
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.840]   that you happen to be looking at.
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.460]   To put it in the words of a great neuroscientist,
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.680]   unfortunately he passed away some years ago,
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.120]   but he was a member of the National Academy,
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.400]   extremely accomplished neuroscientist,
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.520]   who once turned to me and said,
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.120]   "Never forget, a drug is a substance
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.840]   "that when injected into an animal or a human being
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.520]   "creates a paper."
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.580]   Meaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.300]   or any supplement in most all conditions.
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.080]   However, it is in cases such as this study
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.480]   where you can quite convincingly see
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.080]   that the particular feature of physiology
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.180]   that you expected to change actually changed,
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:23.420]   and you see a psychological outcome
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.040]   that you can gain much greater confidence
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.820]   that the changes in delinquency,
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.160]   in this case reduced delinquency, improved attention,
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.160]   reduced aggressiveness, and so forth
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.040]   was at least somehow related to the shift in blood physiology
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.680]   and levels of L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine and carnitine
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.280]   in the bloodstream of these children,
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.880]   as opposed to something else,
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.460]   like L-carnitine going and affecting some downstream target
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:49.560]   that you have no knowledge of.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.040]   Now, of course, that's still entirely possible,
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.680]   but I think studies such as these increase our confidence
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.840]   that things like L-carnitine can be used
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.320]   perhaps in concert with things
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.200]   like omega-3 supplementation,
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.480]   diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.880]   and therefore more serotonin,
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.720]   obviously avoiding things like alcohol,
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.960]   and as it appears from the study I just described,
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.080]   reducing one's intake
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.760]   or not consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.760]   seems like it would be a good idea
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.840]   if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness,
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.660]   to think about the hormone context
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.440]   and whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.840]   and estrogen or lower testosterone and estrogen,
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.360]   maybe even thinking about the work environment,
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.920]   whether or not you are existing
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.920]   in a particularly competitive work environment
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.960]   and even day life, time of year,
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.860]   and whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight,
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.240]   whether or not you're avoiding light
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.660]   in the evening and so on.
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.920]   So studies such as this I think are useful
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.880]   because they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever,
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.320]   will there be one supplement or one nutritional change
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.740]   or even one behavioral change
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:55.140]   that's going to completely shift an individual
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.240]   from being aggressive and impulsive,
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:01.660]   but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens,
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:04.300]   by paying attention to things like time of year
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.360]   and work conditions and school conditions
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.640]   and overall levels of stress
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.540]   and likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera,
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.920]   that you can use behaviors, diet, and supplementation
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.580]   as a way to shift that overall internal milieu
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.040]   from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure,
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.100]   as it's been called throughout the episode,
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.540]   toward aggressive impulsivity and relax some
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:31.820]   of that hydraulic pressure and reduce aggressive tendencies.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:34.480]   So once again, and frankly, as always,
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.340]   we've done a deep dive into the neurobiology
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.300]   and the psychology of what I believe
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.100]   to be an important feature of our lives,
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.860]   in this case, aggression.
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.260]   I want to point out that in a episode
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.560]   in the not too distant future,
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.820]   I'm going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.260]   from Caltech University, who is the world expert
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:56.980]   on the neurobiology of aggression.
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.640]   In fact, he is the senior author on many of the studies
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.280]   related to the ventromedial hypothalamus
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.880]   that I discussed today.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.880]   Our discussion will touch on aggression, of course.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.940]   So hearing today's episode will help you digest
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.660]   that information, but we are also going to talk
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.340]   about other emotional states.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.220]   He is an expert, not just in aggression,
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:17.960]   but in motivated states related to sex and mating behavior,
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.800]   social relationships of all kinds and how those relate,
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.460]   not just to biology and psychology,
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.860]   but also certain forms of pathology,
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.080]   things like PTSD and the relationship, for instance,
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.480]   between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression,
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.520]   and many other important topics that I know many of you,
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.360]   if not all of you, will be interested in.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.620]   In the meantime, I want to point you
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:42.280]   to his recently released and wonderful book entitled
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.000]   "The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us."
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.760]   And again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.420]   This is a wonderful book.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:53.880]   It serves as a tremendous introduction
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.360]   to the history of the study of these areas,
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.900]   the current science and discoveries being made
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:02.320]   in these areas, all made accessible to the scientists
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.600]   and non-scientists alike.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.520]   It's a very engaging read and so much so
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.040]   that even though he was gracious in sending me a copy,
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.680]   I also purchased myself a copy to give to somebody
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.660]   who is a therapist, and I've purchased another copy
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:17.960]   to give to a high school kid that I mentor
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.840]   because he's very interested in the neuroscience
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.000]   of emotions, and I think we are all interested in emotions,
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.780]   not just fear and some of these negative states,
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:27.960]   not just aggression, but also the positive emotions
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.800]   of our lives.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   And so "The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us"
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.160]   by David Anderson is a wonderful read.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.120]   I can't recommend it highly enough.

[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.980]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:25.880]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.220]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.640]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.120]   for things like improving the transition time
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.160]   and the quality of your sleep,
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.520]   and improving alertness and focus, and so on.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.640]   Anytime you're considering taking supplements,
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.080]   there are several key considerations.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.300]   First of all, those supplements
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.240]   should be of the very highest quality,
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.800]   and you want to make sure that what's listed on the bottle
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.080]   is actually what's in the bottle,
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.160]   which is a problem for many supplement companies out there.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.640]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is pleased to announce
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.720]   that we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.500]   because we believe Momentous Supplements
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.520]   to be of the very highest quality
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.400]   of any supplements out there,
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.480]   and we've been working very closely with them
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.620]   in order to direct them to create supplements
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:09.880]   that are individual ingredient supplements
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.180]   of the particular quality and sources
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.320]   that we would like to see,
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.740]   and that relate to the science and studies covered
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.300]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:19.000]   If you'd like to see some of those supplements,
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.480]   you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.940]   and there you will see some of the supplements
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.840]   that we've talked about on this podcast before,
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.420]   such as magnesium threonate for augmenting sleep,
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:32.640]   things like L-tyrosine for augmenting dopamine,
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.480]   and things like L-carnitine,
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.800]   which we've discussed on today's podcast.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.640]   Right now, the list of supplements
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.880]   and the products that are there is only partial
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.580]   to what will soon be included in the future,
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.100]   so that's an ever-expanding catalog of, again,
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.000]   what we believe to be
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.620]   the very highest quality supplements available to you.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.980]   For those of you that are interested in behavioral,
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.880]   nutritional, and supplementation-based tools
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.040]   for neuroscience and other aspects of your biology
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.900]   that impact your health and performance,
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:00.080]   we have a newsletter.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.200]   It is a zero-cost newsletter.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.900]   It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.160]   You can go to HubermanLab.com,
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.320]   and there in the menu,
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.680]   you'll find the Neural Network Newsletter signup.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.160]   You can just put your email.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.280]   We do not share your email with anybody else.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.120]   You will also find examples of the newsletter
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.240]   that you can download right away without having to sign up
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.260]   and decide if signing up is right for you.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.840]   And if you're not already following us
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.400]   on Twitter and Instagram,
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.080]   we are HubermanLab on both Instagram and Twitter,
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.820]   and at both places,
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:30.760]   I describe science and science-based tools,
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.360]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.880]   of the HubermanLab podcast,
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.420]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:38.200]   of the HubermanLab podcast.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.440]   Once again, thank you for joining me for our discussion
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.480]   about the biology, psychology,
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.320]   and actionable tools around aggression.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.220]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:50.800]   [upbeat music]
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.380]   (upbeat music)
