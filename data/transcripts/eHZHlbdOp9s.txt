[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   - What is an atom and what is an electron?
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Sure, this all came together in a few years
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.920]   around the turn of the last century,
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   around the year 1900.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.180]   Atoms predated then, of course,
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.180]   the word atom goes back to the ancient Greeks,
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.680]   but it was the chemists in the 1800s
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.480]   that really first got experimental evidence for atoms.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.080]   They realized that there were two different types
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.860]   of tin oxide.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.160]   And in these two different types of tin oxide,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.480]   there was exactly twice as much oxygen
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.320]   in one type as the other.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.560]   And like, why is that?
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.840]   Why is it never 1.5 times as much, right?
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.600]   And so Dalton said, well, it's because there are tin atoms
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.440]   and oxygen atoms, and one form of tin oxide
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.960]   is one atom of tin and one atom of oxygen.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.800]   And the other is one atom of tin and two atoms of oxygen.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   And on the basis of this, so this is a speculation,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   a theory, right, a hypothesis.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.060]   But then on the basis of that, you make other predictions.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.220]   And the chemists became quickly convinced
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.740]   that atoms were real.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.340]   The physicists took a lot longer to catch on,
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.940]   but eventually they did.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.380]   And I mean, Boltzmann, who believed in atoms,
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.340]   had a really tough time his whole life
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.440]   'cause he worked in Germany where atoms were not popular.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.900]   They were popular in England, but not in Germany.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.460]   - And there, in general, the idea of atoms
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.540]   is it's the smallest building block
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.140]   of the universe for them.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.740]   That's the kind of how they thought about--
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.440]   - It's a Greek idea, but the chemists in the 1800s
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.920]   jumped the gun a little bit.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.360]   So these days, an atom is the smallest building block
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.140]   of a chemical element, right?
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.120]   Hydrogen, tin, oxygen, carbon, whatever.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.840]   But we know that atoms can be broken up further than that.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.960]   And that's what physicists discovered in the early 1900s,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.760]   Rutherford especially and his colleagues.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.280]   So the atom that we think about now,
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.080]   the cartoon is that picture you've always seen
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.100]   of a little nucleus and then electrons orbiting it
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.460]   like a little solar system.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.300]   And we now know the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.800]   So the weight of the atom,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.460]   the mass is almost all in its nucleus.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.060]   Protons and neutrons are something like 1,800 times
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.500]   as heavy as electrons are.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.820]   Electrons are much lighter, but because they're lighter,
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.180]   they give all the life to the atoms.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.780]   So when atoms get together, combine chemically,
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.800]   when electricity flows through a system,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.660]   it's all the electrons that are doing all the work.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.120]   - And where quantum mechanics steps in,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.460]   as you mentioned with the position of velocity,
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.920]   with classical mechanics and quantum mechanics
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.760]   is modeling the behavior of the electron.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.420]   I mean, you can model the behavior of anything,
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.100]   but the electron, because that's where the fun is.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740]   - The electron was the biggest challenge
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.140]   right from the start, yeah.
