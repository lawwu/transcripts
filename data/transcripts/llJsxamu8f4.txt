[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   Actually, the funny story from Art Basel.
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540]   So I was hanging with J. Cal and we're talking to Beeple.
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.040]   Yep.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.100]   And for some reason, J. Cal was being nice to me and he said to Beeple, he said,
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.120]   do you know who this guy is?
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.140]   This guy is a legend in Silicon Valley.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.280]   You know, he introduces me.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.660]   And then I said to Jace, I'm like, you know, this is Beeple.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.440]   And he just sold like $260 million like NFTs.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.180]   I'm like, this guy's a legend too.
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.740]   And without missing a beat, J. Cal says, well, maybe for the next year.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.040]   I'm doing all in.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.300]   Let your winners ride.

[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.900]   extremely successful one i'll leave it at that anyway uh really really they were just concerned

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:05.660]   start with inflation and the economy uh while sax and i were in uh miami for our basal there was an
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.260]   absolute uh panic going on two three in the morning people checking their robin hood and
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.900]   coinbase accounts to figure out how much they had lost in their crypto holdings but today
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.820]   i lost more in the robin hood stock than i have in the robin hood app
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.740]   that's too soon bruh that's too soon for me i'm about to distribute i'm like do i distribute now
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.900]   or wait that thing has been a stone sinking to the floor of the ocean well i mean it's pretty
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.660]   never to be found no i mean listen it's 17 18 billion dollars a pretty great valuation
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.820]   uh right now i think it's an opportunity for people but i'll leave it at that let's talk
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.820]   about inflation inflation but we're not dispensing stock advice we're not stock advice but i'm not
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.940]   selling any of my shares i'm telling you right now before i distribute my stock and mark my
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.580]   capital gains i'd like to advocate to people like robin chumak i'm going to just ask you don't show
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.620]   up drunk for the next episode oh my lord i can't even get through the first story here okay inflation
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.220]   does this woman even own a cashmere sweater that she has can we get off of who is this person
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.420]   oh please beep that out god almighty all right
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.940]   what a loser stop i'm glad to hear you're doing something with all those foreskins because
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.220]   we don't want them to go to waste what do they do with the foreskins all those circumcisions
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.500]   i would love for you to just drive here and touch the sweater i mean i i can't i'm like
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.460]   this is something to do on a friday night um all right inflation numbers this is important folks
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.260]   uh inflation year over year sorry but excuse me but if you're if you're spending your time
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.180]   working in biotech working in
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.540]   crypto and fighting climate change it's wrong to buy a cashmere sweater like all of a sudden
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.940]   you also have to look like a homeless you know the lumberjack
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:06.860]   because being ugly is so cool now the idea was do we have to start the show with your fashion
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.340]   you started with that statement by this person who better be good looking or well
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.100]   dressed otherwise they have no right to make this claim all right calm down chamath let's get to the
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.300]   show you insulted his sweater game that's the definition now we know what he's most sensitive
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.900]   honestly you might as well have called me a oh dude you might as well dude dude
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.500]   stop it's just a sweater comment and it's just conspicuous consumption is that what she's really
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.540]   trying to say she's trying to maybe she's trying to call me the people because you brought it up
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.860]   who is it out her i'm not asking let's cancel her we're not getting nobody's getting canceled for
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.860]   pointing out that you're talking about four thousand dollar chinchilla sweaters i've never
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.540]   said how much they cost we beeped it out i've never said how much this one do you want a sweater
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:06.540]   worth more than four thousand dollars of course i do all right i rest my case i own many but that's
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.580]   what the point guilty on all charges because it's a big u.s consumption uh cpi the past
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.620]   three months today was 6.8 year over year it's the largest increase since 1982. we're getting
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.860]   back to the post jimmy carter era uh and when reagan got in there inherited that mess september
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:34.380]   was 5.4 october 6.2 november 6.8 points up 0.6 or approximately 10 over october 1.4 over september
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:42.300]   and um here's the chart for those of you watching on the youtube channel
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.380]   this all started in march of 2021 that was the first month where the cpi rose over
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.780]   two percent and who was wrong on inflation well the fed chairman jerome powell called it transitory
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.900]   numerous times over the past two years treasury secretary janet gallon uh in her senate
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.380]   confirmation hearing in december of 2020 yellen said she believed the fed and binding admin could
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.500]   take advantage of interest rates being near zero and spend more on stimulus
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.700]   economist paul krugman thought it was transitory in his op-ed how not to panic about inflation
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:18.140]   that did not age well quote our business is actually starting to set prices and wages based
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.820]   on the expectation of high future inflation if they aren't and my bet is they won't be
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:29.740]   then the lesson of 2010 to 2011 will remain don't panic my god he could not have been more wrong who
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.700]   was right on inflation jamie dimon in march i would suspect there is a pretty good chance you're
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.580]   going to see rates going up and people are starting to worry about that the american public
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.740]   specifically gen z has been on top of this issue uh 77 percent of americans were either somewhere
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.500]   or somewhat or very concerned about inflation back in march and gen z uh people aged 18 to 24
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.220]   had the highest rate of very concerned about inflation at 52 percent larry summers also got
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:05.420]   this right sax what are your thoughts on inflation which now seems acute and permanent right well
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.860]   it's definitely not transitory um remember when it was at about 5.1 percent over the summer
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.460]   that the administration said no big deal this is transitory don't panic um then it went to six
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:22.060]   point two now it's six point eight looks like it's headed to seven percent and the real problem here
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.340]   is that these guys the administration have not adjusted course in light of this data what they've
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:33.660]   tried to do instead is now speciously claim that the same bills that they had written and conceived
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.660]   the build back better bill somehow even though it was conceived at a time uh that was really
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.980]   deflationary that somehow this is going to fight inflation they're essentially repurposing
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.220]   they're just changing the arguments they're using as opposed to
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.340]   changing their their legislative priorities and just today we got a report from cbo
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.380]   saying that this build back better bill wasn't going to cost 2 trillion like the administration
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.860]   said it's going to cost 5 trillion and add 3 trillion to the deficit for 10 years correct
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.980]   over 10 years if those programs are not sunsetted so there's a bunch of budgetary gimmicks that were
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:11.820]   put in the bill basically a lot of the programs would sunset after one year or three or six years
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.980]   and so that's the only way they've gotten it to this you know 1.9
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:22.140]   trillion dollar price tag the reason why that's a gimmick is because once the programs are created
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.860]   there's going to be it will create a special interest or constituency who is now dependent
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.260]   on those programs and no one's ever going to want to cut them milton friedman's milton freeman
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.940]   famously said that there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.740]   so that is the game that progressives are playing is they're going to create the dependent the
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.860]   dependency the constituency who once they receive the program is never going to want to give it up
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.740]   and they're counting on the fact that they're going to be able to cut them and they're going to
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.700]   be able to get the money out of the bank and they're going to be able to get the money out of
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.820]   the bank and they're going to be able to get the money out of the bank and they're going to be
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.060]   able to get the money out of the bank and they're going to be able to get the money out of the bank
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.100]   which means they will cost five trillion and it will add three trillion to the to the debt um to
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.540]   the deficit so you know the problem is it'd be one thing if we were in a deflationary environment if
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.900]   the economy was in the tank but these guys are continuing to pump more and more stimulus into
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.460]   an economy that has enough and really larry summers made this point all the way back in
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.940]   february i think this is worth reading what he said he said there's a chance that macroeconomic
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.500]   stimulus on a scale closer to world war ii level of inflation is going to be a big problem and
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:15.900]   the global economy is going to be a big problem and the global economy is going to be a big problem
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.740]   and the global economy is going to be a big problem and normal recession levels
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.420]   were set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.260]   he said this in february everyone in the administration dismissed him all the
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.220]   liberal economists that you mentioned basically derided him he turned out to be exactly right
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:36.060]   and he was just saying this about the the one point the roughly two trillion they passed back
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:42.060]   in february for of covet stimulus and you know since then they passed 1.2 trillion
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.260]   for infrastructure and now it's this another five
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.940]   trillion for build back better so you know the real problem here is that they are not adjusting
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:56.220]   course in light of this data that keeps coming out that inflation is a bigger and bigger so what's
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.380]   the right thing to do in your mind sax and then what about you elon said it can this bill we don't
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:06.700]   need it this is not what biden was elected to do you know he was elected to provide normalcy stop
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:12.940]   the chaos and he never got a mandate for this kind of you know whatever 10 trillion dollars
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.020]   we've been wanting to do an infrastructure bill
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:21.020]   bill for a long time but we didn't that was prior to pumping so much stimulus into the system
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.860]   it's just done the infrastructure bill and not the build back better it would have been one thing
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:31.980]   um but we're this is basically the the third hyper stimulatory bill that that they've sought to pass
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:38.380]   first they did the covet release bill at a time when really the economy didn't need that stimulus
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.780]   dovetailing this and chamath involved in this is the jobs report uh november non-farm payroll
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:50.700]   rolls increased only 210 they expected it to be 573 so it's a big miss however kind of a
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.620]   missed bag because there's over 11 million job openings and we're now at 4.2 unemployment rate
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:02.300]   which is the lowest which is getting towards the pandemic lows and you know this is like before the
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:10.060]   2008 financial crisis chamath how do you reconcile inflation along with this crazy bizarre job
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.540]   situation where people will not go back to work people are planning on resigning there continues
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.140]   to be resignations and there's too many job openings and people are raising salaries and
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:24.700]   still can't hire people well i think we did a pretty good job of unpacking the great resignation
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.220]   i think it was last pod so right remember like yeah there are three structural issues at play
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:36.860]   in the jobs front one is that you have this really meaningful under immigration that's happened
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:44.300]   because of trump the second was you've had a big mismatch between the degreed classes in america and
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:50.220]   the jobs that they can have for what they think they should earn meaning you go to school you get
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.780]   into all this debt you try to become a teacher or something and then you realize you can make more at
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:00.780]   an amazon warehouse crazy strange and then the fourth is you have all these boomers with an
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:06.300]   enormous amount of savings 30 40 50 trillion dollars who are pulling forward their retirement
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.020]   and also subsidizing their kids you put it all together there's less of an incentive to be in
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.580]   the job force unless you pay higher wages now
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.060]   so i think that's a really important thing to think about
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.060]   and i think that's a really important thing to think about
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.060]   and i think that's a really important thing to think about
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   let's just put a pin in that for a second i think the thing that sax talked about is really
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.060]   important which is that we have to really figure out whether inflation is transitory or it's
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:32.060]   persistent and it's here and i just want to bring up i'll nick i'll send you these texts uh these
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.620]   the the twitter links to this but uh bill ackman tweeted out these two things today which is that
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.820]   if you fan of the pod brilliant investor by the way uh great human being brilliant investor two
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.820]   very specific things he actually called out
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.820]   the word consumer price index which is a very important component of the consumer price index
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.820]   and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.820]   and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.460]   and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.820]   and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.780]   right how much can somebody basically charge rent to other people
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:13.580]   the way that they calculate that which is 30 percent of the uh 30 of the calculation is they
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:20.460]   survey a handful of people the problem is you don't need to survey because the actual exact data
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:28.860]   is available from single-family rentals that report this number so their survey showed basically a
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:36.540]   much much smaller increase than what the actual increase is and let me just give it so the largest
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:43.340]   owners of nationwide single-family rentals are reporting a 17 year-over-year rent increase wow
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:50.220]   the the oer that was calculated quote unquote by survey and the cpi was 3.5 percent if you flow that
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:58.060]   through it means that core cpi actually went from 4.9 percent today to actually nine percent
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:07.340]   and the cpi print which was 6.8 percent was actually 10.1 percent so it just goes to show
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:13.100]   you we have sources of data that the government is not in a position to collect or measure
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:20.460]   we have horribly inaccurate econometric models that we use you know you know that phrase sort
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.740]   of in out so unfortunately you get very bad garbage you get very bad crappy data
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.380]   and now all of a sudden we're printing numbers we're supposed to make policy against those
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.700]   numbers but the numbers that underlie this decision making is fundamentally flawed
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.380]   and it's flawed in the wrong direction okay let's bring friedberg in freeburg
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.860]   what do you think is happening here vis-a-vis uh also the creation of companies
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.860]   and entrepreneurship because one of the weird things that's occurring is we're starting to hit
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.300]   a record number of llc's s-corp c-corps being created it seems like a lot of people are
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.740]   becoming freelance nation uh hundreds of thousands of new companies during the pandemic were started
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:04.540]   that is probably one of many places where the water is flowing when you fill my cup
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:11.820]   and it shall overflow with um i was talking to a guy this week who's just a small eight
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:21.340]   was not that bad yeah come on yeah put the wine down no no let him drink the wine um and uh fast
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:26.220]   this guy has a multi-billion dollar consumer credit portfolio in subprime which means you know
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.820]   he's got the a bunch of consumers owe him money that um generally there's going to be a high
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:41.500]   default rate and his no comment not and um he said that this year the portfolio performed beyond like
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.700]   the one percentile of the model distribution of what they expected to happen they they had the
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.900]   yield on the portfolio be 40 higher than they thought it would be because there's so much
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:57.820]   liquidity in the hands of individuals and so i think you know um jason while you might make the
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:03.020]   argument that companies and jobs are being created that is one of many places where like you know you
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:09.740]   overflow a river and lots of streams start to flow you know we're seeing asset bubbles everywhere in
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:16.700]   crypto in startups in new startups and new ideas in home prices and everything sneakers
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:23.980]   now the problem with inflation is um you know it's a uh definition we all use this term and we throw
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:30.860]   it about but like inflation is really the measure of price going up over a period of time and
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.900]   generally you want to have inflation of some amount that allows you to see economic growth
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.380]   and expansion that allows you to fund the debt that you used to create that growth in the first
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.020]   place
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.180]   and so without infl without some sort of an inflationary pressure which is the output of
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.540]   economic growth you end up you know being unable to meet your debt obligations and then things get
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.500]   really ugly and uh the system as it was constructed because most of these governments and systems like
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:01.900]   we have today are funded by debt so um you know uh stan druckenmiller gave a good interview in
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.540]   q2 he was kind of on a road show you know um sounding the alarm bells around what was going
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.780]   on he was saying the market is not speaking right now because basically you know the market is not
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.580]   speaking right now because basically the fed kept canceling the market signals uh with their um
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.540]   with their interest rate policy and by canceling those market signals it seemed like we had a free
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.780]   for all at the government level to keep spending and so i i do think that these two are pretty
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.340]   interrelated the fact that we've kept interest rates low have allowed policy makers to say you
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.500]   know what the cost of debt for this government is zero we can do anything we want just like consumers
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.340]   are saying we can do anything we want we can buy anything we want we can spend any way we want
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.620]   and as a result we're kind of seeing this you know inflationary pressure
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.860]   uh persist now the problem is if you then raise rates and you can't borrow that money and suddenly
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.220]   people have to start to pay that debt down with um without economic growth having occurred the
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.500]   business goes the whole system goes bankrupt so the challenge that the fed has is how do we raise
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:01.340]   rates without triggering an economic recession and if people are now have overspended and are
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.380]   over levered once again and rates go up it's going to get really ugly really fast and so
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.380]   this is a first derivative balancing act so you know if you're going to have a good balance of
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.260]   money you're going to have to be able to keep your money in the bank and then you're going to have to
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.140]   have to have to pay the debt that you owe so that's the first derivative balancing act and yeah
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.020]   there's no simple and easy solution unfortunately meanwhile technology is causing deflationary
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.460]   pressures which is exactly you know maybe what you don't want to see happen when you're trying to
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:32.060]   realize economic growth um and that's uh yeah the other thing that we talked about is that the fed
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:40.140]   basically changed the or the government changed the rules on the percentage basically what qualifies
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.720]   a million dollars. And if you think about it, most Americans, you know, 80 to 90% of
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.380]   their true underlying wealth is their home, to the extent that they build, you know, positive
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:56.060]   net worth. And if you all of a sudden, you know, push up the upper bound on what a conforming
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.820]   mortgages to a million, a million dollars, that effectively means it's, it's roughly
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:06.060]   about 20%. That effectively means that you're moving people's net worth up by about four
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.560]   million. That's right. So and so if they take that, and then they take that money out of
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.860]   their home via a HELOC or an equity line of credit, right home equity line of credit.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.800]   And then you know, to your point, Friedberg, they spend it or they invested or they you
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:25.960]   know, it could be a real disaster scenario in five or six years. No, no, this is more
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.000]   like 1929. Kind of Yeah, by the way, if you go back to the remember when we were in like
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.060]   the depths of the market collapsing and everything when basically the economy shut down with
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.060]   lockdowns on COVID started.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:42.300]   And I was speaking to a senior banker at that like that day. And he told me, look, it's
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.560]   pretty simple what's going to happen. The Fed's going to drop interest rates to zero
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.180]   and they're going to pump money into the system. Because that's the only way you're going to
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.380]   be able to keep asset prices from collapsing. And we're going to artificially inflate asset
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.840]   prices and we're going to do it for a long time. Because then people look at the stock
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.620]   market and they say, Oh my gosh, stocks are going up. Oh my gosh, revenue is going up.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.680]   Everything gets inflated by pumping money into the system. And the problem is, while
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.060]   there's
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.420]   a, you know, a perceived you keep saying the home price goes up, and I keep saying
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:15.840]   stocks go up. But the purchasing power that arises when the inflation is higher than what
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:21.380]   those things are going up at indicates economic recession underlying that inflationary bubble.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.520]   And the circumstance needs to be analyzed, unfortunately, a little bit more deeper than
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.600]   that, which is it's not just about inflation. It's about have we pumped enough money in
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.740]   to trigger economic growth, that we can come to balance where the growth can outpace the
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.680]   inflation, and we're not there.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.320]   Well, superimposed on this, I think about it. Sorry, let me just say, let me just say
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.140]   one simple analogy. Let's say I've got 50 clams. And you know, there's suddenly a bunch
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.280]   of clams come into the clam market. Now I got 100 clams. And if the number of clams
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.420]   has gone up by three x, my purchasing power has actually gone down by a third. While it
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.600]   might look like I've now got twice as many clams, I can only buy one third as much as
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.960]   I could buy before, because there's so many more clams floating around. And that's the
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:06.060]   problem. Clams, you look like clams, clams, clams, so you like I'm just, listen, I did
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:12.740]   a little bit of math, I've been watching the price to sales ratios of some of the top companies,
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:22.080]   we can pull this up on the screen. And the price to sales of companies, including zoom,
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:28.000]   obviously was ridiculous. During the pandemic, that was a pandemic stock. So on top of all
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   of this money being printed to the system, you want to be able to get a lot of money
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   out of it. And you know, you're going to have to be able to get a lot of money out of it.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   So you had the participation of a bunch of stonk traders, you know, in that whole movement,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.160]   buying up meme stocks or others, we had the price sales ratio of zoom, in other words,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:49.000]   the value of the enterprise versus their actual sales was at 123. It's now at 14.7. Peloton
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   was another one of those at 23. Now down to three x, down 87% Coinbase Square also, it
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.100]   drops off pretty significantly here.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:05.920]   But you can also we looked at the peak price to sales and how much larger it is then and
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:12.560]   so some of these are now off eight x four x and then it drops off to two x one x. But
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.780]   it quite a I don't know if you guys are looking at the numbers or if you have any thoughts
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.860]   on this, but we're reap it seems like there was a mispricing of certain equities.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.140]   And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.140]   And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.140]   And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:33.480]   institutional investors to be out as long dated as possible in buying earnings?
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.940]   You have to remember, it's not just that real rates were effectively zero, but if you wanted
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.460]   to own inflation protected securities, it was actually a negative yield, so we were
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.380]   destroying people's savings.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.500]   There are a lot of institutions, well not individuals, institutions that must own some
