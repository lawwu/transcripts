[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   School will be out soon and family vacation season is about to begin and a
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.760]   listener named Ryan writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I'm wondering if you
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.560]   could discuss a theology of vacations. You often talk about not wasting your
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400]   life or any moment or season in it. Intellectually I agree, but at times it
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000]   seems I need to rest. Where do vacations fit?"
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.440]   Well you do need a rest and the Bible provides some pretty significant
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.480]   foundations for rest and I think indirectly for vacations. Let me
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   just mention a few of those foundations that I think give us some guidance.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.800]   Number one, God created us in need of daily sleep. I have always found that
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.600]   quite frustrating. I hate sleep. I find sleep boring. So why did he make me like
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   a helpless baby that must go unconscious one-third of my life? I mean just think
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.760]   of it. What is the message in that? There's got to be a message in that and
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   Psalm 127 says, "It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   the bread of anxious toil, for he gives to his beloved," some translations say, "in his
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.480]   sleep some sleep." I think the gist in the context is pretty much the same.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.400]   According to this text, sleep is a gift from God and the gift is often spurned
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.640]   by anxious toil. Peaceful sleep is the opposite of anxiety. God does not want
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.200]   his children to be anxious but to trust him so, I conclude, that God made sleep as
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.720]   a continual reminder that we should not be anxious but should rest in him like a
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.640]   little baby. Unless you turn to become like a child you can't even enter the
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.840]   kingdom. He created sleep to make sure we would have a daily reminder we are not
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:24.400]   God. Our work is not decisive in running the world. God's work is decisive. He who
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep, Psalm 121. So we sleep, God never
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.920]   sleeps. So sleep is foundational, it's a pointer, and I think the big picture
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   there we take away is don't get a big head about your work that
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.120]   you think you can run the world or make everything happen. You're like a little
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.040]   baby a third of your life and God meant to tell you something. Number two, God
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.800]   established a Sabbath principle. However you relate the Old Testament law to the
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.320]   present, the Sabbath remains a gift with wisdom in it. I remember reading C.S.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.800]   Lewis's wife's book on the Ten Commandments and seeing her point out
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.920]   the wonder and the glory and the incredible gift of telling an ancient
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.600]   agricultural people whose lives depended on working the land, "Not only don't you
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   have to go to work today, you may not go to work today. Mandatory weekly vacation."
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.000]   And it was stunning. I mean I just had never seen it in that light and she
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.960]   said, "That is exactly the way it would have landed on people at least at the
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.800]   beginning. You may not work seven days a week. I won't let you. You must." And
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.200]   then he consecrated it to himself as a sign of his own creative power and
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:09.520]   holiness, but the underlying issue of its gift nature to a worn-out, finite,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.200]   tired agricultural people remains. And so I say the rhythm of work six, rest one,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.440]   work six, rest one, work six, rest one would probably spare a lot of heart
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.920]   attacks and give longevity to many lives prematurely taken because they never
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.040]   unwind the spring. They're always working. They're working at home and they're
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.920]   working at work and they're working in their play and they can't stop working.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.960]   And I don't think that's what one in seven means. This spring that we live by,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.360]   especially for some of us, it needs to be unwound. Not just two weeks a year, but
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   one day a week. Here's number three, third foundational idea to point towards rest
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:07.400]   and vacation. Work is good and it's not a curse, but it is redeemed. So we we must
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.040]   work the works of him while it is day. Jesus called for work and we ought to
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.680]   work. And Paul said, "If anyone's not willing to work, let him not eat." And I
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.720]   love this verse in 1st Corinthians 15, "Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.320]   in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." That
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.960]   means be doing a lot of it, abounding in the work of the Lord. And Paul said, "Don't
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.320]   be weary in doing good." So here's the rub. How do you not grow weary? I mean, he
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.560]   says, "Don't grow weary in doing good." But we get physically depleted, we get
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.080]   mentally depleted, which raises then the question of vacations. And here's the
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.800]   last thing I would say. Here's the fourth foundational thing. God's
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.880]   Son took special times to rest from labor. Mark 6 31, "He said to them, 'Come away by
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.760]   yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.'" It's interesting that he said that
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.720]   right after these brothers buried the chopped off head of John the Baptist,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.360]   which meant probably not only did you risk your lives to go get that head, or
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   the body at least—I don't know which they buried—they got his body, they buried it.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.080]   You risked your lives, this has been a high-stress time for you, so come away
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:42.120]   and rest a while. So my summary would be, it seems that the issue of vacations
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.560]   becomes a matter of wisdom. We should try to know ourselves, know our families.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:55.000]   Seems to me that in this fallen age where the focus is on redemption, the
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.640]   final rest that we are promised is only tasted incrementally and as a means of
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.040]   more productive labor in this redemptive age. Play and recreation in this age is
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.920]   not the main way we glorify God, it's secondary, I think, and it's a means
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.520]   of refreshing us and inspiring us for productive labor. We work to advance
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.320]   God's saving kingdom in a fallen world, and that's true whether we're in secular
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.640]   work or so-called Christian work. Vacations and Sabbaths and days off and
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:42.880]   nights of sleep are recreations of creative, happy, fruitful labor for the
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.680]   advancement of Christ's kingdom in the world, whether you're in a secular
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:55.040]   work or not. And of course, there is no clear line, I feel this especially for
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:02.360]   many of us, between vocation and recreation. Many of us so love what we do
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:10.800]   and find so much pleasure in it and are so energized by it that the concept of
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.520]   taking time for recreation for the sake of creation is not so clear. For those
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:23.520]   folks, we need to make sure that we know not only ourselves, but we need to
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.440]   know those around us, because our wives may not feel the same, and our kids may
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.360]   need us when we're just super energized by our reading or our study, and that's
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.720]   not what they need at this time, and vacations account for that as well as
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.400]   for us. Thank you, Pastor John. And speaking of dads leading their families well, I'll
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.720]   take this opportunity and every opportunity I can to remind listeners of
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.440]   the episode we recorded back in January, which is titled "Dad's Role in
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.360]   Homemaking," episode number 255. You can find that in the iPhone app, and soon the
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.120]   entire archive of episodes will be available on the Android app as well, so
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.520]   stay tuned for that. Tomorrow we'll talk more about a father's leadership over
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.400]   his family, specifically, how does a dad best serve his family on family vacation?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.720]   I'm your host Tony Rienke. We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
