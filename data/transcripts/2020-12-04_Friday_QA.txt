[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.800]   So today we're going to begin with Austin in Louisiana. Austin, welcome to Radical Personal
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.720]   Finance. How can I serve you today, sir? - Hey, Joshua. I'm doing well. First,
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.600]   I found a resource that I wanted to share with everybody based on your last episode.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.120]   - Great. - It has been really helpful.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.080]   And it's called Year Compass. And it's basically a free 20-page workbook for end of the year wrap
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.520]   up and future year planning. And it's been really beneficial to me. So I wanted to share that with
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   everybody. - Love that. So it's called
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.320]   Year Compass and it's a website? - Yeah. So it's just yearcompass.com.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.200]   And you can go down to their website and you can download the workbook either in a digital format
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.600]   or a printable format and it's completely free. - That looks great. So yearcompass.com,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.680]   download the end of the year workbook and work through the year behind and the year ahead. So
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.720]   thank you for that resource. Go ahead with your next topic then. - So my next question was,
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.320]   is I've just this year started my real estate business. I've acquired my first property.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.000]   And one of the things I'm looking at for the future is to kind of scale up, but not being
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.640]   an extremely wealthy person at this point who has hundreds of thousands of dollars of disposable
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.240]   income. I'm wondering if you have any thought exercises or kind of methods for going through
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.520]   what is a reasonable amount of money to, I guess, put into that business development
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.320]   moving forward? Any percentages of net worth or anything like that, or any thought exercises you
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   have that you might go through if you were in a similar situation? - Are you building a real
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:12.240]   estate business as an agent or as an investor? - As an investor doing mainly buy and hold
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.640]   single family. - And when you talk about scaling up, are you saying, how do I go from one property
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.240]   to 82 as quickly as possible? - Yeah, I'm looking more in the range of 10 to 15 properties. And
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.160]   I'm trying to think of, would I be taking on too much risk to highly leverage myself in the short
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.320]   term in order to build that portfolio quickly versus more of a slow play? - Okay. Well, the
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.680]   word I would use to start with before we talk about scaling would just be to talk about leverage,
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.240]   because I think it puts a good picture in our mind that's applicable to the word scale up.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.280]   When you think about leverage, leverage is a double-edged sword. Leverage of any kind,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.720]   I'm not just referring to borrowing money, I mean the concept of leverage. Leverage will
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.880]   amplify your results. So when you're getting good results, leverage can amplify those good results.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.440]   When you're getting bad results, leverage can amplify those bad results. So in any kind of
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.760]   business operation, when you're going to use leverage, when you're going to scale, you want
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.720]   to make sure that first you're getting reliable, consistent, very good results, and then scale that.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   Now, there's no perfect formula that I know of where you could say, this is how fast you can do
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.480]   it. But what I do think you need to do is you need to be very honest with yourself to identify,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.440]   am I building something that's going to be genuinely strong and powerful, and do I have
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.240]   all of the kinks worked out? Usually that takes a little bit of time. Usually it takes some time to
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.920]   develop the processes, to prove them, to perfect them, to work through the problems. And so you
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.280]   want to make sure that you don't go too big too fast. So if I'm counseling someone like you,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.920]   my answer is one property at a time, right? One house at a time. You just bought your first one,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.520]   good. Get your first one, get the whole deal totally done, work out all the kinks of the
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.160]   process, then think about what went well, what could I do better, right? What went well in the
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.000]   process? How did the acquisition process go? How did the inspections go? Do I have what I need?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.560]   Did I get good information all along the way? How was the rental process, et cetera? Optimize it,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.680]   and then do it again. And then just do one at a time for a while. And then after you've gotten
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.440]   through a number of deals, I don't know, three, four, five, I don't know the actual number,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.880]   then maybe you go ahead and go a little bit bigger. And you might try, "Okay, I can do two
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   at a time." But what you don't want to do is you don't want to get in too deep too quickly to where
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.520]   all of a sudden you're trying to close six deals and run six different crews to rehab houses, and
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.320]   that'll sink you. And in a business like a real estate business, there's not really anything
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.560]   that's going to fundamentally change in that business that I can see in the coming years.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.520]   There may be a market move, right? So maybe you all of a sudden find yourself in a market where
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.360]   you can get a bunch of deals. Well, if you recognize that and you honestly look and say,
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   "This is a market where I should be buying, buying, buying," then go ahead and speed up,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.560]   scale up quickly. But the business is not going to fundamentally change. So there's not a lot of
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.760]   time pressure. And so it's very much in your interest to go a little slower if necessary,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.200]   so that you have a more stable, longer-term business than to go too quick and get in over
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.720]   your head. I started working as a financial advisor in 2008, and I wound up at a lot of
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.960]   kitchen tables with people who were losing their real estate portfolios that they'd purchased in
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.240]   the last few years. In observing what happened, and I had several close friends who built
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.320]   multi-million dollar portfolios, went bankrupt, lost it all. In observing it, I could see how
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.160]   if they had gone a little slower, they could have kept their portfolio through that time
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:05.520]   and been a whole lot farther ahead in 2010 and 2011 and now in 2021 than they were by going too
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.760]   fast. So I think you want to make sure that you have a good system, good processes all set in
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.280]   place before you scale it up. Now, how you actually apply that, I don't know. But I would say go slow
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.360]   in the beginning and then move. One analogy that I think would probably apply, when you're learning
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.960]   to do something like a certain athletic move or lifting weights, the most important thing in the
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.880]   beginning is your form. It's not how much weight you move. If you're coaching somebody who's
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.720]   learning how to squat for the first time, if they have perfect form, you know that in the future,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.080]   they'll be able to squat 500 pounds. But if they have bad form, you know that they're going to be
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:53.200]   plagued with injuries, problems, slow advancement, etc. And so in the beginning, all you want to get
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.960]   right is their form. You don't pay attention to the amount of weight on the bar in the beginning.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.560]   You just want to get their form right. And you want to get their form to the point where they
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.720]   can do it without thinking, where all of their body mechanics are exactly right,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.800]   because you know that that will scale for a very long time. So that's the
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.440]   metaphor I think that I would apply or the analogy I would apply in this particular example.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.520]   Okay. Well, as a former competitive powerlifter, I appreciate that analogy.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:26.000]   There we go. So in the powerlifting space, you know that if your form is good,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.280]   then you can go ahead and go for a heavy lift. And you can go through a cycle where you're cycling
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.200]   up, cycling back. You can adjust all that stuff down the road. And there's only modest chance
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.960]   of injury. And I would say the same thing applies to real estate. If your form and your skills are
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.080]   good and your processes are good, you can scale it up and there's only a modest chance of injury.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.880]   So that would be my answer. Do you have any thoughts on
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.520]   like debt to income ratio and things like that? That's kind of what I'm interested in is that
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:08.640]   since I'm using this to kind of build and generate wealth is my long-term goal. Any thoughts on a
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:16.480]   ratio of the amount of debt in relation to net worth or the amount of monthly payments in relation
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.440]   to income? I've done some looking and I know that the banks have debt to income ratio calculators
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.000]   and things like that. Do you have any thoughts on those? I don't have a ratio or a number. You can
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.680]   use the numbers from the financing system and maybe somebody who's a more experienced real
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.560]   estate investor than I am would have one of those. What I would do is I would look at my situation.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.760]   I would imagine my worst case scenario. So I don't mind using leverage to build a real estate
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   business. I think that's wise. I think it'll build it quickly. And I don't mind it building
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.560]   quickly. I've often tell people, "Okay, let's say you need 10 houses or 12 houses." I think you said
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.600]   something like 12 houses or 15. "All right, so let's do one this year, one next year, maybe two
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.480]   the next year, two or three the next year. And then if you can do four a year, fine."
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.400]   So in the acquisition phase of real estate investing, I think you should not be paying down
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.800]   debt. You should be keeping as much liquid cash as possible, putting as little down on the
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.680]   properties and acquiring them. But along the way, you need to ask yourself, "What's the worst case
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.960]   scenario?" Now, I think right now in the context of COVID, the worst case scenario is you have a
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   widespread unemployment rate. So I would say, "What was the unemployment rate some months ago?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.880]   What if 30% of my renters couldn't pay their mortgage? And what if I couldn't revict them?"
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.960]   Well, that's probably about the worst case scenario you could conceive of.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.000]   Maybe something worse would be fire, but that would be a risk you would cover for insurance.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.360]   So I would think maybe 30% of my tenants are unemployed, and they're not paying rent,
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.040]   and I can't evict them and get another tenant. So what would I do in that situation?
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.440]   Well, I would calculate the cost of the mortgage payments. I would calculate my cash flows,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.040]   and I would model what that would look like. Now, in a worst case scenario like that,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.240]   I think you would have negotiating leverage with your lenders and be able to renegotiate your
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.840]   loans and still probably keep the portfolio. But I would just simply play a scenario like that out,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.680]   and I would say, "What would I do in those circumstances? So where would I get the income
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.200]   from? How would I cover the rents? What properties would I dump? What properties would I keep?"
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.680]   And as long as you're thinking about some of those worst case scenarios and wargaming them,
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.560]   I think you'll guide yourself properly.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.120]   Okay. Thank you. And do you have time for a second question?
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.000]   Go ahead. We'll do it fast.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.400]   Okay. I have an ongoing discussion with a friend of mine who's about 30 years older
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.880]   about hyperinflation and potential economic collapse. And I might answer this question
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:47.440]   for myself since I just bought your course. But I was just wondering, he already has a pipeline
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:55.120]   into Canada. So we were listening to one of the previous Q&As, and his kind of question,
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.680]   what we were talking about is, "Would you have any more recommendations besides setting up a
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:06.800]   pipeline into Canada for bank accounts since the Canadian economy would probably be quickly affected
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.520]   if the American economy went in the tank?" Yeah, no question. That whole course is full
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.920]   of suggestions. And basically in the course, which you bought called How to Survive and Thrive
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.760]   During the Coming Economic Crisis, I cover any kind of crisis because the way of planning is
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.480]   the same whether you're planning for the loss of your job versus planning for hyperinflation of
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:35.040]   your local currency that you're involved in. And there are two basic strategies that I cover in
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.640]   that course. Strategy number one is basically stay in place. How do you stay in place and have what
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:47.120]   you need? So if you're worried about hyperinflation of the currency, and if you live in a hyperinflated
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   economy, you're better off living maybe on a small homestead on the edge of a small town
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.000]   with good neighbors around that you could set up some kind of security perimeter to secure your
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.800]   neighborhood and grow some food and have some stuff stored in your food storage or whatever
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.760]   so you can get through. That's a really good system for that. But the other strategy is to flee,
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.680]   is to leave. And so if you can leave a place where there is a massive economic crisis like
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.200]   hyperinflation and go somewhere else, you can avoid most of the effects. And the example that
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.120]   I talk regularly about because it's the most current one, we can go back and talk about
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.920]   Zimbabwe, but we don't know much about Zimbabwe. Right now, the best one is Venezuela.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:35.360]   Venezuela, it was the biggest, most prosperous economy in Latin America, was the jewel of Latin
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.280]   America, the jewel of South America a decade or so ago. And then they started down the path of
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.840]   hardcore left-wing socialism. They had Hugo Chavez followed by Nicolas Maduro.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.320]   And we can see the hyperinflation that has completely devastated the country to the point
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.760]   where right now in Venezuela, Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves. I don't know,
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.080]   some of the largest in the world. I don't know how to place it in comparison, but they have
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:08.080]   massive, massive levels of oil. But the whole country has experienced horrific gas. And they
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.720]   had so much cheap gas before. The gas was literally a couple pennies a gallon a few years ago.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.640]   Well, now they have no gas in the country. And they're dependent on Iranian oil tankers to bring
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.600]   gas so that they can have some gas. And to get gas, gas is something like, depending on where
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.160]   you go, these numbers change all the time, but right now gas is something like the equivalent of
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.880]   about $20 a gallon, if you can find it. In order for somebody to get it, they have to stand in line
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:43.040]   for at least a day in order for them to get in line, get it. And you can't get parts to repair
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.160]   your car, et cetera. It just goes on and on. It's horrific. It's an absolutely devastating collapse.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.640]   But when you study it, you see some lessons. So anybody who left Venezuela a number of years ago
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:00.320]   and went somewhere else has survived that crisis just fine. Now they may have lost some money if
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.680]   they still had money there in Venezuela. Their family may be affected if their family was still
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.880]   stuck there. But any Venezuelan who moved to Colombia 10 years ago and now lives in Bogota
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.280]   is not as deep, not very deeply affected by the crisis. Any Venezuelan who moved to Canada
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.840]   is not affected. It goes on and on. The list goes on. So you can see that you can do well
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.880]   in an economic crisis if you can relocate, if you can reposition yourself. Now Venezuela, I think,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.640]   so far, I would have to go back and check the charts, but it's turning out to be one of the
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:35.520]   longest examples of hyperinflation that I've ever studied. So we'll see when it actually ends,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.480]   when some kind of change happens. I have my own thoughts about what I think is going to happen,
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:46.000]   but we don't know. But most hyperinflations don't last for more than a few years,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.600]   at kind of the maximum of a couple of years, because they can't. They're too painful.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.200]   And so no matter what, it basically has to stop because there's no way it can go on and on and on.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.360]   And so the collapse can go on, but the hyperinflation can't go on and on.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.280]   And so what I talk about in that course is that if you could leave for a couple of years,
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.760]   you could do pretty well. You could survive well enough. And so that's a good kind of starting
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.360]   point to work through is how could I leave my country? The other thing that is important to
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.320]   point out about Venezuela is hyperinflation, I don't think, is contagious. So we see this very
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.200]   clearly right now in Venezuela. The Venezuelan bolivar is worthless. It's completely worthless.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.800]   They've done several currency resets, chopped a bunch of zeros off. But even still, if you're
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:39.760]   trying to deal with bolivars, $10 US gives you a literal backpack full of banknotes.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.040]   I've used to post pictures of this stuff on social media. I have stacks of Venezuelan banknotes
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:53.360]   in my house here. And what they do is they take the banknotes and they wrap them in clear tape,
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.200]   and they handle them as bundles. So they're still used as a medium of exchange. But instead of
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.960]   having a single bill, you hand over about a three-inch stack of the pink ones, or about a
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:12.480]   two-inch stack of the green ones, and they're wrapped together in bundles of tape. But what
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.040]   is used as a medium of exchange? Well, the number one most useful currency is the Colombian peso.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.000]   And so you have a country right next door. You have Venezuelan, Colombia right on each other's
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.280]   borders. And if you were to go to the Brazilian border, you would have a similar thing with the
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:34.640]   Brazilian real. But you have the Colombian peso is the currency of choice. And so the hyperinflation
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:41.360]   from Venezuela didn't automatically spread contagiously to Colombia. It's a centralized
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.400]   thing. It's a nationalized problem. And so I think there's good evidence to believe that although
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.640]   certainly the Canadian economy would be massively affected if there were some kind of hyperinflation
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.800]   in the United States, I don't think the Canadian currency would necessarily be affected in the same
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:07.120]   way. If you had a hyperinflation in the US dollar, then I think the Canadian dollar would still be
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.320]   pretty strong. I think that's why I talked about that tunnel option, if you can tunnel out to
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.640]   another currency. Now, if there were actually a situation where there were hyperinflation in
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.200]   the US dollar, I would not be betting on one currency. I would not be betting on the Canadian
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.560]   dollar. I would be diversifying out into other currencies. But the point is to have the tunnel
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.640]   in place. So let me just close though with any conversation about hyperinflation. There are two
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:39.600]   things I want to say as I wrap up this answer. Number one, we don't know actually what would
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.960]   happen if there were a hyperinflation of the US dollar. Because although the Venezuelan Bolivar
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.200]   hyperinflated and that didn't spread to the Colombian dollar, the US dollar is not exclusively
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.400]   a national currency. The US dollar is used all over the world. I mean, all throughout Latin
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.120]   America. If you do business with a Latin American government, most of the time, prices are often
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.520]   quoted in US dollars. If you drive a car into Mexico and you're going to put your deposit down
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:16.000]   with the Mexican government for your car, they quote you that in US dollars. In Mexico,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.320]   massive economy, very successful country, amazing country. But if you're going to drive down into
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.600]   Mexico and you need to go ahead and get the sticker for your car, then the quote is $300.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.640]   And the border guard will tell you, you're probably better off to put this in dollars and
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:37.040]   pay us $300 versus the equivalent in Mexican dollars. Because if you give us a Mexican dollars,
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.320]   then there's a chance that at the other border, if you're driving out the bottom end or coming
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.280]   back up a few months later or whatever your travels are, there's a problem is that the border
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.680]   will charge you for any variations in exchange rate. Whereas if you just give us a flat $300
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.080]   deposit, we'll give you back $300 US dollars whenever you come back. And so the US dollar
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.760]   is truly the world's reserve currency. It truly is global and foreign governments all around the
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.000]   world quote their prices for their services in US dollars because it's more stable.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.320]   So what would actually happen if a currency like the US dollar hyperinflated?
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.280]   There's a decent chance it would be more contagious than the Venezuelan boulevard.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.760]   The final comment that I would say though is I do not expect a hyperinflationary scenario in the US
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:27.840]   dollar. Even though we have plenty of examples of hyperinflation that we can study, there has never
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:36.000]   been in the modern era hyperinflation of a large Western currency like the US dollar. And I cannot
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:46.560]   conceive of how the Federal Reserve and the monetary managers would ever – how they would or
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:53.040]   why they would ever allow for a hyperinflation of the US dollar. Is it possible that things could
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.280]   change 10 years from now? Yeah, I think it is. Is it possible that you could have a bunch of bat
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.400]   crazy people kind of involving? Yes. But I don't see how the interests of the Federal Reserve
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:13.520]   border served by hyperinflation. So I think it's a very unlikely scenario. It's plannable for it,
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.160]   but I think it's very unlikely. I don't lose any sleep over it.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:22.960]   Okay. Well, thank you for your perspective. My pleasure. We go on. Let's go to
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.880]   Josh in California. Josh, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.080]   I just want to give you a little update and then ask a question.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.720]   This is about the California to Texas hobby farm transition. I called about a month or two ago.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:44.400]   So that's actually in the works. We pulled into our Airbnb about a week ago, thanks to your
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:51.120]   suggestion. We completely overlooked that. So we've completely cut ties. We were able to actually
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.960]   triple the size of our house and our mortgage has gone up $200 a month by leaving California and
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.720]   coming out to Texas. And we weren't able to do a proper hobby farm. We're in a little subdivision,
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.640]   but it's got a large enough backyard that I can aggressively garden. And that was partly based on
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.560]   your insight in that a two-year-old and a five-year-old are functionally worthless in
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.080]   a farming situation. They're worse than worthless. They make everything way more difficult.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:27.360]   It's worse than worthless. It's negative worth. Oh, so much. They are beautiful little logistics.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:37.840]   So that's definitely took your advice and comments under much discretion as we went through. So I
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.160]   appreciate that very much from you. So we are moving in that direction and things are going
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.880]   very well. So I do appreciate the advice along the way. Today's question specifically was on
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.280]   our retirement. During this whole change of address thing, I realized that I have
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:02.720]   three outstanding 401(k), 403(b) type things from previous jobs. My wife has two others and she's
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:10.560]   establishing one at the new job. And for that more practical or tactical, however you want to
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.800]   approach it, what should we do with those? In the past, you had mentioned putting those into an IRA,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:27.440]   but practically, how would we move from the old company retirement account into either my current
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.920]   IRA or establishing and then funding an IRA for the wife? Cool. I'll answer that. I wanted to
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.560]   point out a message and I don't have a good way of follow-up for this. So sometimes when a caller
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.320]   calls in and because I don't have comments enabled on the website, I probably should go back and
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.040]   enable comments on the website so that this conversation can happen there. But after you
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:57.120]   called in, Andy in the Facebook group had put in this particular input and I encourage you if you
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.760]   didn't see it to go and find it. But after that call, Andy wrote in and he said, "Speaking into
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.080]   the ether here to Josh in California from the Q&A call today or anyone else who's thinking about
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.920]   moving to the country, if I heard right, you mentioned you're on a quarter to a half an acre,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.600]   thinking of moving to 20 acres. I'm guessing you've never owned more than that half acre,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:19.040]   so just wanted to share my perspective. I've lived on half, one-tenth, five, and now 26 acres.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.120]   There's an order of magnitude difference as you go up. If you just want to supply, say,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.120]   double your own egg consumption, all your fresh veggies and some meat or dairy supplements,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.520]   you absolutely do not need more than three to five acres to do that. If you want some woods
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.680]   or just to own land or whatnot, by all means go for it, but you could probably supply 80%
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.880]   of your calories and make 50 to $100,000 on 20 acres if you manage it with the intensity.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.160]   If you're not managing it intensively and not using it, it'll just cost you more money.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.240]   I've got about a third of an acre in gravel. That's not nightmarish to maintain, but it
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.960]   pretty much necessitates a tractor, which is more expensive than a lawnmower. Not complaining,
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.480]   of course, I'm happy with my life, just pointing out that if you just want to do homestead stuff,
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.480]   I think two to five acres would be a much more appropriate size unless you want to buy something
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.320]   with woods in the back for your kids to play in. Happy to discuss country living more. I just
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.120]   heard that and thought my experience might be helpful. Best wishes to anyone interested in
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   moving to the country. There's some other good conversation there in the Facebook group
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.240]   that Andy sparked when you called in. I think you made a good decision.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.400]   All right, back to the IRA question. Let's first talk about the reasons why you would move the
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   money and the reasons why you wouldn't move the money just so we get that clear and then how you
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:34.800]   actually do it. The reasons to move the money are fairly simple and fairly compelling. First of all,
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.560]   a lot of times if you move the money from an old employer plan, an old 401k, an old 403b,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:47.040]   to an IRA, you now have the free and total market that you can choose from. When you have money
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.360]   in an employer-provided plan, that is simply a plan that has been chosen by your employer
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:59.440]   from a specific number of vendors. I used to bid on these when I was a financial advisor. I'd go
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.640]   into an employer and I'd say, "Listen, let us come in and let us run your 401k." It's a business
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.440]   like anyone else, like any other business. You get paid on asset management and fees, etc.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.000]   And so there's an incentive for companies to come in and say, "Let us bid and let us run your 401k."
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.440]   So the employer will work with a couple of different people. They may try to cobble
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.640]   something together themselves. We want to hire this TPA, this third-party administrator. We want
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.040]   to use this investment company. They might use a turnkey solution. So there's all kinds of companies
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.080]   that have turnkey solutions where, "Hey, we'll make things simple. We'll do everything for you."
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.600]   There's big names, right? There's the Fidelities, the Vanguards, and then there's little names.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.480]   There's the little guy next door. The challenge here is you don't have any control over what's
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:51.280]   offered to you. And so you sometimes have rock-bottom fees. Sometimes you have very high
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   fees. 403b's are famous for having higher fees, much higher than 401k's. Some 401k administrators
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.040]   have very low fees. Some have very high fees. And it all depends on what the employer has negotiated.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.480]   And you don't know whether that employer went out and said, "We're going to find the absolute
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.160]   cheapest person on the market, and that person is cheap and junky, and they don't do a good job."
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.320]   You don't know whether that company is cheap and good. You don't know whether that company
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.960]   is expensive, but they just have an inside relationship with the owner of the company or
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.640]   with the decision maker, etc. So you don't get any choice there. In addition, you don't get any
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.800]   choice of what funds or what fund companies are available to you. Now, 401k's at this point are
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:38.240]   fairly standardized. And so most 401k's have a pretty good company with pretty low fees,
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:44.960]   and they have a pretty good selection of investment options. But the point still stands that if you go
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.320]   to the open market, you get total control over that. You can choose what provider you work with,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   what investment advisor, what fund company. You can control your fee schedule. You can choose a
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.280]   rock-bottom, absolutely cheap thing. You can choose to work with an advisor who charges you
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.120]   money, but you get some other value from them. In addition, you also get total openness of
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.760]   investment options. So you can go to a company that offers the kind of mutual funds that you
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.320]   want. You can go to a self-directed IRA, and you can start buying rental properties or investing
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:21.360]   in tax liens or buying gold and putting it in your 401k. You can do anything you want,
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.880]   and you don't have any of those options in your employer-provided plans.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.840]   So that's the most important and very compelling reason for most people to move their money from
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.600]   an old employer to an IRA. The other more minor but also important conversation, I think,
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.680]   is just simplicity. If I die, do I want to leave behind four different accounts that my wife has
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.720]   to go through and individually collect from the beneficiaries, or do I want to leave one account?
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:57.040]   I guess you could make a counter-argument and say that there's risk and there's not a lot of
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.600]   diversification in putting all the money there, but I think that with the SIPC protection and
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.000]   whatnot, I think that's a very modest risk. I wouldn't be nervous about having all my accounts
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.040]   with one company, at least to a certain point. So you get a lot of simplification.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:17.200]   Now, the most important reason not to move the money that I try to point out that I have very
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.560]   rarely heard discussed, and I'd like to get it much more popularized, has to do with asset
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:28.480]   protection. Some states, such as the state of Texas, protect IRAs and Roth IRAs, etc.,
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:34.320]   in the same way that they protect 401(k)s. So if you have an IRA in the state of Texas,
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.720]   somebody sues you or you go bankrupt, according to the law, or at least my understanding of the
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:45.040]   law, never having practiced in Texas, according to the law, that money in an IRA should be just
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:51.120]   as exempt from bankruptcy courts, should be just as exempt from the claims of creditors as it was
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:57.040]   in your employer-provided qualified plan. That's what the law is. And that, I would say, is probably
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.680]   in most states at this point, but not all. Now, a very important exception, because of a huge
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   population, would be California. California does not, at least my understanding, never having
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.440]   practiced in California, just having an information chart in front of me that I use to track this
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:18.640]   stuff. California does not provide the same level of asset protection, creditor protection, for IRAs
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:25.760]   and Roth IRAs as they do for 401(k)s. 401(k)s and 403(b)s are what are called qualified accounts.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.600]   They're federally qualified accounts. And by federal law, in order for it to be a qualified
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:36.400]   account, by federal law, any qualified plan is exempt from the claims of creditors. So if you
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:44.480]   were still living in California, if I were living in California, I would not move my funds to an IRA.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.360]   I would always keep my retirement accounts in a 401(k) in order to have the creditor protection,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.880]   the bankruptcy protection that is offered by that 401(k) account. Again, unless my information on
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:01.040]   California is mistaken, which I don't think it is, I would not do that. So what I would do is I would
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.480]   consolidate my accounts to whichever one was the best. So I might move the 403(b) money, which is
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.640]   probably expensively held high fees, I might move that into one of my older 401(k) employer accounts
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:19.040]   rather than keep it in the 403(b). But I would still make sure that it's always in a 401(k)
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   or a 403(b). And this is especially important if I were going into a place where I thought I had
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:30.560]   some kind of elevated risk against creditors for some reason, I'm in a financially precarious
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:36.400]   situation, I'm starting a business, etc. I want all that money in the 401(k) because that is as
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.600]   close as we get to sacrosanct in the US creditor protection laws. The IRS will still take it.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.280]   It can still be lost in divorce court. But with regard to bankruptcy, getting sued, etc.,
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.760]   that money is fully protected. The mechanics of this are easy. So if you decide to move it,
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:58.800]   you just decide where am I going to transfer the money to. You open an account, and usually you'll
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.320]   just do a custodian to custodian transfer. And that'll be spelled out by the provider that you
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.800]   use. So if you use a discount online provider, use a Vanguard or a Fidelity or something like that,
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.560]   they'll do it automatically for you. If you work with an advisor, the advisor will submit the
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:21.440]   paperwork. Most of the times, the firms will use a clearinghouse. And so there's a fairly simple
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.280]   and established system behind the scenes to do a custodian to custodian transfer.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.680]   That's your safest choice to do that custodian to custodian transfer because then the money
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.360]   doesn't come into your hands and you don't risk having a tax event. If you can't or don't choose
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.600]   to do a custodian to custodian transfer, then you can have the company send the money to you.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.120]   And then you have a time period. I think it's 60 days, but it's been years now since I've done any
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.200]   of these transfers. So I could have gotten that wrong. But you have a 60-day window to be able
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.760]   to put the money into the new account. So they can send you a check. You can choose to not have
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   taxes withheld and they can put it in. But it's better to do a custodian to custodian transfer
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.320]   unless for some reason you need the money. There have been once or twice where I've recommended
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.560]   this as a bridge loan for somebody who was desperate for financing. Have the company send
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.480]   you the money, spend it, do what you need to for 30 days, and then figure out how to get it back
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.360]   together and get it back into the next account before that time period goes up. But your new
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.720]   custodian will give you all the instructions on how to actually do that transfer once you're getting
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:29.440]   the money into the IRA. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. The simplicity and the various options, I think,
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   is the biggest factor for that. So I definitely will be working on that this afternoon.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.800]   Good. It's kind of a weird spot for you to give advice, but for any of the online
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:45.760]   managers, we're kind of agnostic to who we use. Do you have any front runners that you would suggest?
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.200]   The big ones? General Fidelity or Vanguard?
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:55.520]   Yeah. I mean, I hate to ever give a specific company advice because if I'm going to advise
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:03.280]   one over another, I want to have some compelling reason to do it. So I would just say just pick
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:09.360]   with those. Between Fidelity and Vanguard is fine. They're both rock solid. They both have
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:16.080]   bottom price funds. If you're a diehard Boglehead or you're becoming one, Vanguard is wonderful.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.040]   They're just absolutely awesome. If you like some of Fidelity's options, they're also good.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:28.160]   And there are many, many good solutions as well. So I don't have any reason to support one over
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.280]   the other. I think they're all equally good, and I'm not aware of any reason why you would
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.760]   choose one over another. Awesome. I think that was it for me.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.360]   Thank you so much. Have a great day.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.280]   All right. We go now to Andrew in Georgia. Andrew, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today,
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:49.040]   sir? Hey, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call. I have an education question for you and two brief
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   tax quotes if we have time. Let's do it.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:36:00.080]   So my first question is I have a daughter that I'm thinking about starting kindergarten early.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:05.840]   She's pretty bright. And number two, keeping up with the number one child already in the number
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.320]   one child's kindergarten work. But have you found any resources? I know you've done a lot of reading
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:18.080]   about education that might inform that decision. We're not in a position to do homeschooling right
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.600]   now. That may be a part of the equation in the future. It's a private school. I think they would
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:27.920]   be flexible on the state's rules for when kindergarten can be started. But I was curious
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.800]   if you could recommend any resources for considering the decision of whether to start a
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.320]   child in kindergarten a year early. Do you have the money to pay for a private school?
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:46.240]   Yes. And it is a private classical school. Okay. Well, there are a couple of different...
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.680]   So when I've looked into this, I don't have a PhD in education. I'm just an interested
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:57.600]   absorber. You have a couple of different perspectives that you'll hear represented
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:03.680]   when you start digging into it. There is a perspective of aggressive early education.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:09.520]   Now, that can even go all the way down to educating babies. And so you would have,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.840]   I guess, Glenn Doman would be the most famous kind of person who name attached to that,
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:22.000]   "Teach your baby to read." A very big fan of even as babies teaching children academics.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.440]   What I think I'd point out before I go on is that it's not kindergarten though.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:33.120]   Like if you look at Glenn Doman or "Teach your baby to read," it's a five-minute session while
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.760]   the child's finishing up their cut-up peaches in their high chair. It's a five-minute session
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:44.000]   of flashcards. It's not sitting in a classroom and doing kindergarten. There are other people
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.040]   who are advocates of early child education. So if you look at government education, you see
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:54.000]   a big push towards free kindergarten for everyone and enroll your children early.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.320]   I haven't seen anything that has persuaded me that that's a good idea for me personally.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:08.400]   I think that the push towards early kindergarten is much more a matter of indoctrination
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.480]   and conformity than it is what's in the best interest of the child. And so when I look at,
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:19.280]   "Hey, this country is rolling out free kindergarten for all three-year-olds and we want to get
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:25.440]   everyone into three years old," I'm very uncomfortable with those approaches.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.520]   Now, that's kind of the starting early phase. On the other side, you'll have people who vigorously
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.960]   defend the idea that it damages children to start academics too early, that it's bad for them.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:43.520]   Many of the big names will say, "Start at seven," which is of course later than is the custom.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:51.040]   So my opinion on it is that there's not really any clear reason as to why one age versus another age
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.520]   would make the difference. If one of my friends comes to me and says, "Hey, look at all this stuff
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.000]   I'm doing with my three-year-old and we're teaching her all these just incredible things,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   and look, she knows 562 Chinese characters," I say, "That's awesome. Great." And if I have
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.440]   another friend that comes and says, "Ours is just not ready. He's six, but we're not worrying about
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.040]   it. We're just going to wait a little while. He's not into it yet." I'm okay with that as well.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:22.480]   I'm to the point where I really am. So I want to trust the parents to look at their child and say,
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:29.440]   "Hey, my child is expressing these interests, and so therefore, she's ready for this certain thing."
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:35.280]   So that's what you're doing. So in that context though, I'm uncomfortable with pushing academics
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.000]   too early. And if you're not going to do homeschooling, what I would say if you were
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.720]   going to do homeschooling would be just read as much as possible. Grab a couple of workbooks
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.040]   that you think your daughter will think is fun. If you want to do a math workbook, great.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:55.120]   If you want to do something else, some skills thing, go for it. But otherwise,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.000]   just read as much as possible. And if your daughter wants to learn to read, teach her to
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.960]   read. There's no reason why you shouldn't teach someone to read if they're early. But don't stress
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:08.400]   about it. Do it. And I think that there's a big reason to say that play is really valuable and
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:14.080]   really important. So if I had a three-year-old that I was looking at and saying, "Hey, she's
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.240]   ready for…" Yeah, she can already basically read as a three-year-old.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:26.000]   So if she can already read as a three-year-old, then what I would say is my instinct is to go in
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.360]   some kind of more play-oriented, like a Montessori school. I might put her in a Montessori school
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.680]   for a year, a couple years, something like that, and then transition to the classical school myself
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:42.240]   just because of my concern about it just being pushing her down. But if you look at it and say,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.440]   "You know what? She likes to read. She's interested in it. Try a couple of workbooks.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:51.120]   Is she going to like bookwork? Talk to the teacher at the classical school and put her in. And if
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.480]   she doesn't like it or it's not doing well for her, then pull her out. If it's not doing good
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.600]   for her, then pull her out." But that's my answer is I would be more inclined. I'm not a Montessori
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.360]   acolyte. I appreciate a lot of things that they say. But I think one of the things that they do
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.280]   a good job of is giving for a good environment where there's a whole lot of play, which I think
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.960]   is really important at that age especially, at every age, but especially at that age.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:22.160]   Yeah, those are some great thoughts. And every kid certainly is pretty different, aren't they?
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   If you will just simply trust yourself as a parent, and you and your wife are talking,
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.920]   and you're looking at your child, and you're saying, "Okay, is this good for our child?"
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.800]   Then just trust yourself. And if it's not, just commit that you're going to pull it out.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.080]   That's something that I didn't have with the first time through.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.840]   We didn't have that conference. Finally, it took a little while because I was like, "Okay."
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.800]   I think a lot of those times, those of us who homeschool feel this like extra pressure,
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.040]   which we shouldn't feel, but we still do, this extra pressure to say, "Wow, I'm doing this thing
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.920]   that's still uncommon and out of the ordinary. I need to get really great results. And I'm an
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:04.080]   overachiever." And so my wife and I, we didn't... I don't want to say we pushed our eldest,
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.480]   because I don't believe we did anything bad, but we were just... We were diligent. We were
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.000]   trying to get him focused on school. And we reached a point where we just said, "This isn't
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.400]   working. He's not ready." And we probably... With the first time around, we were probably a couple
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.680]   of months late in recognizing he's not ready. And so we stopped. We just quit, and we just let him
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.120]   play. We read to him, and that was it. We didn't do anything. Then we came back. We were moved to
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.960]   a different situation. We came back, and we started bringing more in. And it was so fast and so easy.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.360]   And my siblings who homeschool their children, have older children, they'd all warned me that
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.960]   this was going to be the case, but I didn't really believe them. Well, now with the second time
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:47.840]   around, my second child is in kindergarten technically, but we just allow her to do what
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.960]   she wants to do. And we... Meaning that we have some books for her, and she's excited about them.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.400]   And if she doesn't get something, we don't even worry about it, because I know that she will get
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.000]   it, and I'm not going to waste any time pushing her. I'm not going to get into any conflicts about
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.320]   you got to do this. She's five years old. There's no reason to push anything at this age. And so
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:13.440]   everything is easier when you wait for the proper age. I think that if your daughter is demonstrating
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.920]   herself to be very bright, then you should challenge her. And so just trust... I trust you
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.760]   and your wife to look and say, "Hey, here's what's working." So my only caution would be,
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.040]   don't be committed to one certain course of action. Do something. If it works and you get
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.400]   results, keep going. If it doesn't, then just quit, stop, and do something else.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:35.920]   Well, very good. Sounds like the next step will just need to be,
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:43.440]   is it even a possibility with particular schools? But okay, if I shift gears and ask you
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.280]   two brief tax questions. Let's do it. Go.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:54.240]   First is something that I find difficult to find information about online. In 2017,
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.200]   I had some charitable contribution carryovers. My income on paper is actually pretty low,
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:06.800]   but I've never been able to figure out exactly what I can do with that and does that expire?
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.960]   It was about $12,000 worth of charitable contribution carryovers that the tax software
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:22.800]   spit out. This year, I'll be doing about a third of my... I think that's when you get over 50% of
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:30.320]   your income in charitable donations. This year, I'm only going to be doing about 30% of my income,
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:36.160]   again, paper income in charitable contributions. So is that not a factor for me if I never
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.040]   hit that 50% threshold again?
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.920]   I do not remember the rules on that. I'm sorry. I don't remember the rules.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.080]   It's pretty technical and I think it's probably even changed since 2017 with the tax law changes.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.120]   Yeah, you'll have to consult a qualified professional on that. I don't remember.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:58.960]   Fair enough. Okay. Last question would be, I'm starting a business helping people
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:08.000]   with home security and I've bought some items to help me with that and to create some training
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:16.080]   and example materials this year. I haven't really done a lot else with the business except to write
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.640]   some draft papers and training and that kind of thing. But it's only about $3,000 worth of stuff
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:29.440]   and as far as I can tell, it'll only be about a $300 difference in my taxes. So I didn't know
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.640]   if there's any advantage in just declaring those losses this year or just waiting till the future.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:49.680]   So you're saying, "I've got the equipment. Should I wait to deduct the equipment until
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.800]   in the future when I actually have income or should I try to deduct it now?"
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:46:01.680]   I mean, I don't think I can do it in the future. I have to either declare it as losses this year.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:09.920]   But is there any advantage to not starting the paperwork until later since the losses
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.080]   are so small now? No, I don't see why you wouldn't start it now.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.920]   Okay. Yeah. So you've got the limitations on deductibility of startup expenses. So I'd read
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.560]   those rules. But with what you're talking about, it doesn't sound like that much. I think you'd be
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:32.000]   under the $5,000 limit on deducting startup expenses. So I wouldn't see any reason why
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.920]   you wouldn't start it now if you're actively in business. And if these are ordinary necessary
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:40.720]   expenses, then why not deduct them to the extent that they're possible? I see no reason why you
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:46.240]   would wait. And especially that you're probably – with this kind of business, you're probably
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.520]   going to be doing cash accounting. If you don't deduct them now, again, read the startup expense
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.760]   rules. But if you don't deduct them now, you're not going to be able to deduct them in the future.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.640]   So I don't know why you wouldn't just go ahead and deduct them now.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.400]   Well, great. Can move forward on all those things. Thanks very much.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:09.600]   My pleasure. My pleasure. Thank you for calling in. All right, we go now to Jason in Washington,
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.000]   DC. Jason, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.960]   Joshua, long time listener, first time caller. Thank you for taking my call. So my wife and I
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:26.640]   are having an inheritance and we're trying to get an idea of how to – and I know this question may
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:33.600]   be broad – how to integrate it and what to think through and where to put certain things. So it's
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:42.960]   just the top numbers would be like $300,000 from a TSP and then a home that's paid for. And we're
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:50.000]   trying to get an idea of how to integrate it for growth and for future wealth and what we have.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.400]   Are there any kind of supporting details that I can give you that would help
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.760]   kind of spark a little bit of that conversation more?
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   What is the value of the home if it's sold?
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:11.440]   $325,000. We have a family member, a grandmother, who is living in there that we anticipate
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:18.800]   we would allow to live there for the duration. But that still is part of what we're trying to
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.160]   do. But that still is part of what will be coming over.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:28.000]   Okay. How much is your current net worth more or less, just ballpark, big picture?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:39.040]   So we own a home, I would say maybe $150,000 after debt and everything is taken out.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.080]   Other than a home mortgage, do you have any significant personal debt?
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:51.120]   No, we have $8,000 in debt, which is credit card and a medical bill. Everything else is free and
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.760]   clear. And in the home, I'm sorry. Household income is how much?
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.320]   $205,000.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.000]   Okay. How old are you and how old is your wife?
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.960]   44, 45.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.680]   Do you have children?
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.880]   One child, but he's independent, 19.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:16.720]   And do you – whose parent or whose relative died?
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.840]   My wife's aunt.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:27.600]   Okay. Well, in a situation like you're describing, certainly it's a significant gift compared to
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:34.480]   your net worth, right? Just the TSP alone is an effective doubling of your net worth if your
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   household net worth is $160,000. So that's fantastic. With the fact that it's the TSP
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.040]   and the house, now it's very significant as compared to your personal net worth.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:55.920]   It's not such a significant event as compared to your income. If your household income is $205,000,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:04.320]   the TSP is a little over a year's worth of income. And the paid-for house is – again,
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.360]   put all together, it's three years' worth of income. So I think the first question I would
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.680]   have is from your age and from your income, I would ask you, are you doing a good job accumulating
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:21.040]   wealth? For you to have a household income of $205,000 to be in your mid-40s and to have a
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:27.200]   net worth of $160,000 is a little bit light. Now, I don't think it's a fruitful conversation for us
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   here. There could be good reasons for it. You could have recently increased your income. You
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.280]   could have – this could be a new thing. You could have dug out from underneath a million dollars of
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.800]   business debt or something like that. It doesn't matter. But it's a little bit light. That ratio
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:45.120]   there is a little bit off for somebody. What it indicates to me is that maybe you haven't – it's
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.840]   possible that you haven't been as good with money before in your life as it would have been nice to
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:56.000]   have been because it would seem like your net worth should be a little bit higher with a $205,000
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.960]   income. Now, what you need to do is not tell me about it. What you need to do is analyze and say,
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.920]   "Where am I in my wealth-building journey? Did we make a lot of mistakes or not make a lot of
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:11.600]   money earlier and now we're doing well?" In that situation, then I would just say you continue
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.720]   doing more of what you're doing. So if you're in a place where we're making good decisions,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:22.560]   we're earning well, we're saving well, we're living within our means, we have a chance now
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:29.360]   to really get ahead, then I would just bring and fold the inheritance in to your overall plan if
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:35.760]   you have one. If you haven't been good with money – and my fear is maybe you haven't been great with
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:41.440]   money in the past – then you need to be very suspicious of this and you need to say, "I better
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.160]   not screw this up and so I need to move really slowly." In that situation, I would keep the
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.600]   money segregated for a time. I wouldn't rush to go ahead and start receiving income from it
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.440]   and I would do what you're doing now, which is solicit some good advice and get a very clear
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.280]   plan for it. So I guess I do need to probe a little bit. Have you been good with money in
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.480]   the past? How are you as far as accumulating wealth? Are you good at it, not so good at it?
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.840]   How would you rate yourself? >>Jaymee So we went through the whole Ramsey
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:18.640]   debt paying off thing. So that 8K pretty much is the last of it. So it was basically paying off
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:24.160]   debt. So we are good at now obviously managing money, not spending it beyond our means. I think
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:30.160]   we're transitioning into how do we now that we have this amount of income that we're basically
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:36.240]   saving one and a half full paychecks, how do we start to build off of that now since we're out of
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.760]   the debt, out of the Dutch, you know, digging out from under. >>Tavis So you need an investment plan
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.400]   now, which is not easy. It's not easy to give you, but that's what you need. You need an investment
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.360]   plan and you need to figure out what can I invest this money into where it's going to make sense
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:59.280]   for us in the long run. Do you have an investment plan of some kind? >>Jaymee We don't. We have
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:05.680]   been talking to C-only planners and then also certain broker dealers to try to get an idea of
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:12.960]   what a plan should be. I was wondering if you had any suggestions on that subject as well.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:19.600]   >>Tavis I would start with my friend David Stein. He runs the podcast,
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:26.720]   blanking on his name is embarrassing, Money for the Rest of Us. His book, his podcast is called
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:32.320]   Money for the Rest of Us and he wrote a book a year ago called Money for the Rest of Us,
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:37.600]   10 Questions to Master Successful Investing. I would start with that book. Go ahead and read
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:43.280]   that book. It's a very well-written book and it talks about things very broadly. David's been on
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:49.200]   the show way back in the early history of Radical Personal Finance. I interviewed him and he has a
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:55.840]   background in money management. He used to run some large funds for some corporate clients and
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.560]   he does a lot of investing and a lot of it is stocks, which I think are wonderful solutions
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.560]   for investing, but not exclusively. I think that would be a good place to start.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:11.040]   The biggest question you're going to have to face, give you just a quick little speech on investing,
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.960]   biggest question you're going to have to face is what do we want to invest in now? Because this
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:23.680]   money basically brings you very quickly through the end of Dave Ramsey's seven baby steps and
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.520]   brings you to the point where now you are effectively financially independent. Not saying
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:33.360]   you can just stop working, but you're effectively financially independent and you can make any
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:38.400]   choice that you want. That's the thing about this gift is you have enough cash from the TSP,
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.560]   first of all, that you can make any choice in life that you want. The first thing that I would do
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:50.160]   before I started digging into stocks, et cetera, is I would ask myself questions about my life and
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:56.400]   my lifestyle. The most important ones are, you've heard me talk about my big three. Number one is,
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:05.200]   who are you with? You're married, so you're with your wife, but don't change that. Do you live
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.040]   with people that you want to live? Do you live near parents? Do you want to live near parents?
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.000]   The second thing is, where do you live, which are usually related, but the geography of where
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.680]   you live is usually one of the most important things. If you just hate the Washington DC area
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:23.040]   and you've always wanted to live in a little mountain town in Colorado, what I would do
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:27.840]   is I would use the money to facilitate my move out of the little town in Washington DC or out of...
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:38.960]   That didn't come out quite right. I would use the money to facilitate my move out of Washington DC
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:44.000]   to the little mountain town, out of the big giant metropolis swamp of Washington DC to the little
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.880]   mountain town of Colorado. I would just use it to facilitate that. I'll make smart decisions along
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.760]   the way, but if you've been dreaming about living somewhere else, go for it. Now, if you decide,
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:00.720]   "No, we're happy here. This is where our home is. We love DC. I think DC is a great city.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.560]   From a cultural perspective, it's hard to imagine a better place in the world to live."
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:10.160]   But then the third thing is, "What about my work? What about my job? What about my income?
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:19.760]   Am I doing work that's really a good fit for me?" I think it's useful to have inherited this money
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:26.320]   because I would say, "What if it were $10 million?" I would pretend it was $10 million
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.560]   myself, and I would say, "Let's say that we all of a sudden inherited $10 million.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.280]   So now we're totally financially independent. What would we do? What would we do with our lives in
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:43.680]   that situation?" The way I like to do this as a journal activity is imagine that you inherited
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:49.600]   $10 million and then fast forward a year. Just give yourself a year to go out and do some of
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.440]   the hedonistic things that you've always thought would be fun, to buy a Harley Davidson and ride
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:57.600]   across the United States or go travel around the world for a year, staying in five-star hotels or
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:02.320]   whatever, those kinds of things that you would do. So then imagine forward a year. You've gotten
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.440]   most of that stuff out of your system. So what would you do a year later after you had inherited
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.080]   $10 million? It's Monday morning a year later. What would you do on that Monday morning?
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:17.840]   And I would really spend a lot of time analyzing my career and thinking about what kind of work I
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:22.960]   would do, what kind of business I would run, where I would live, et cetera. And then I would
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:29.680]   personally invest this money into facilitating those lifestyle transitions first. So if I've
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.240]   always imagined that I would love to own a little coffee shop in the mountains of Colorado, then I
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.760]   would go and I would buy the coffee shop and I would open it in the mountains of Colorado.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.840]   If I've always imagined I would go and get a PhD in philosophy and become a philosophy professor,
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.560]   then I would go and get a PhD in philosophy and become a philosophy professor. I would
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.920]   invest in myself first and into my lifestyle before I would invest into stocks or real estate,
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:58.560]   et cetera. Then once you've made those big three decisions, which could be a total life
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:04.720]   transformation, all of a sudden you and your wife are running a little bed and breakfast on the
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.960]   beaches of Portugal, maybe that's where you are a year from now and I would use the money to pay
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:12.400]   for that. Or on the other hand, it could be you're doing exactly what you're doing now and you're
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:16.880]   living where you're living now and you're totally content. Then I would go ahead and say, "Well,
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.040]   how do I invest the money for financial growth? Do I buy stocks? What kind of portfolio do I build?
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:26.480]   Do I buy real estate? Do I buy a business?" et cetera. But I would think really hard about
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.920]   that lifestyle change and go ahead and get us into the lifestyle that we don't want to retire from
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.840]   before I would go ahead and start buying financial investments. So that would be my
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:45.440]   advice as to how you proceed. I appreciate it. I love the thought process and I'll definitely
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:50.480]   re-listen to this to go through that step. Outside of the book recommendation,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:56.560]   do you have previous podcasts that you maybe say, "Hey, Jason, listen back to one of these that
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:03.440]   maybe covers an aspect of what will be coming up or a similar situation?"
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.280]   It's sprinkled all throughout where I've talked about it. I haven't done a whole series on
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:13.760]   investing. At some point, I can and I should. But basically, you'll get three different – when I
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:19.600]   talk about investing, I always divide it into three categories. The first is active business.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:26.320]   Most underrepresented, but I think it shouldn't be, but the most underrepresented category is
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.240]   active business. If you want to take a sum of money, you want to take $600,000
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:36.640]   and you want to turn it into a lot of money, the most reliable way for you to do that is to invest
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:41.200]   into an active business, to buy a business or to build a business that's going to be
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:47.920]   productive and profitable. Your highest return on investment is generally, in almost every
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:52.480]   circumstance, going to come from business. So that can be something very simple. You can buy
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:59.360]   a Subway franchise or buy a McDonald's or buy a carpet cleaning franchise or something like that.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.320]   I use franchises because they're simple to understand. But if you took this money and you
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:11.520]   started opening Papa John's franchises, it would be very productive for you in terms of the financial
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.480]   return. That even just franchises where you don't have to come up with a business idea,
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.040]   you don't have to come up with a business structure, you just buy the franchise and
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:23.280]   operate it. It's wonderful. Now, if you have something else like your own independent idea
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.000]   of a business that you would like to run, that's also – if it's done well, it's also going to be
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.520]   profitable. So that's always going to be your highest return on investment is with active
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.920]   business. The downside is that active business is going to require your time. So you want to make
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.520]   sure that that's something that you actually want to do. If you don't want to leave your job and run
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.760]   a business and your wife doesn't want to leave her job and run a business, then don't. So then you
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:50.560]   move on to the other two. So you first have active business. The second category of investing is we
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   can either say real property and we can use the technical accounting definition of real property,
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:01.200]   which is often real estate, or we can just use what I like to do speaking big picture of tangible
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.240]   property. We can invest into stuff. We can buy stuff. So that stuff can be collectible knitting
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:15.680]   needles. That stuff can be antique firearms. That stuff can be gold and silver coins. That stuff
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.520]   can be giant commercial buildings. So there's a whole world of buying and selling stuff that we
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.280]   can talk about. And there's mainstream stuff like seeing like three bedroom, two bath houses in
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.600]   suburban neighborhoods like condos and downtown areas. That's all mainstream stuff where there's
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.560]   a really good market for it. It's very predictable. There's good financing for it. Or you can find
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.880]   really offbeat off the wall stuff. You can become an expert in 16th century French gold coins.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:51.680]   And that's your world of stuff that you're involved in. There's no limit to the stuff
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:57.520]   that you can buy and invest in. And then the third category is paper assets. And so a paper asset is
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.760]   something that draws its value based upon the performance of something else. And so I'm going
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.720]   to use this very broadly. Paper assets would obviously be stocks and their derivatives.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.360]   We could have mutual funds. You could have options. You could have all of the various
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.400]   things representing ownership or trading in the ownership of shares of companies,
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.440]   bonds, lending money to people, lending money to companies. You can do other paper investments
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.160]   though. You can invest into – you can do hard money lending. You can invest in tax lien
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:33.760]   certificates. You can write foreign mortgages for missionaries overseas. There's no limit to
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:40.720]   the kind of paper investing that you can do. So active business requires a high use of your time.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:47.760]   It's very demanding on your time, generally speaking, but it's very profitable. Real property
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.360]   is demanding on your time but probably less demanding on your time than active business.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:59.440]   If you have a business buying and trading antique firearms, well, that takes time, right? You're
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.680]   going to gun shows on the weekends and you're buying inventory and you're wrapping inventory
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.040]   and you're dealing with accounting. But it's not quite as time intensive as running a pizza
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:15.120]   franchise or running a Jimmy John's. But it is intensive in time. But it's also probably more
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.640]   profitable than some other things. It's more profitable than buying a CD at your local bank.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.200]   Paper investments, depending on your strategy, are often going to be your least time required,
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.000]   right? You can take all the money. You could trundle it down to Vanguard and buy a total
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.680]   stock market index fund and have a very high quality, pretty decent investment with that money.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.440]   It's not going to require any time and it's going to be pretty good. It's just not going to return
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.160]   anywhere near as what you would expect those other categories to return. So that's why I say you
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.040]   start with your lifestyle design. Start with how do we want to live, how do we want to set up our
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:56.800]   life? And then from that, then go on to what would be an investment that would fit what we're doing.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.120]   I think that if you'll buy an investment, again, depending on how satisfied you and your wife are
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:07.520]   with your careers, etc., if you'll buy an investment that gives you the lifestyle that you want,
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:13.360]   you'd be much happier with that than working in a job that you would actually retire from someday,
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:20.480]   meaning that you wouldn't do it just for free. So I think it's better to buy an investment that
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.240]   gives you the lifestyle that you want than to keep working a job that you don't like and buy
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:31.680]   stocks. That's my answer. If I inherited $600,000 and I were working in a job, I would go and I
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.000]   would buy a campground, right? Or I would buy an Airbnb – I keep saying Airbnb – buy a bed and
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.360]   breakfast or I would buy a restaurant, something like that because I enjoy those kinds of social
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.120]   things. Or I would go and do any number of franchises because it'd be more productive and
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:53.840]   I would enjoy that lifestyle more than I would enjoy working a job and having money pile up in
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:05:02.160]   a stock market account. Okay, great. Thank you. Just one quick question based on a previous user
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.240]   caller. You mentioned Vanguard, Fidelity, and you mentioned you had no issues with those.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.720]   Would that include a swab as well? Correct.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.640]   Or I don't know if you… Correct.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   Okay, great. Yeah, I don't follow that market
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.920]   very quickly, but I think they're all fine. They're all competitive. It used to be that a
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.880]   company like Vanguard had a big competitive advantage. When Vanguard was first founded,
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.800]   the big competitive advantage was fees. But what's happened is the whole market in that space has
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:37.360]   responded. And so, the fees have dropped across the board. And so, Vanguard has put pressure on
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:43.680]   all of the companies – on Schwab, on Fidelity, etc. And so, all of them offer now lots of investment
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.600]   choices that are very low fees. And so, I don't know of any… I'm not committed to any particular
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.920]   competitive advantage of one versus another. I'm fine with all of them. That was the point.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.160]   All right, we're going to move on. Let's see. Who do I go to next? One, two, three, four,
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.280]   five. I'm going to have to go fast. Let's go to Peter in New York. Peter, welcome to the show.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:07.760]   How can I serve you today, sir? Hi, Joshua. My employer is going to offer a 457(b)
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.040]   plan and it looks like a no-brainer to me, but I just wondered if there were any pitfalls I'm
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.120]   missing here. No pitfalls. It's a no-brainer. I would participate up to the max that I could
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:22.400]   afford. I think it's a wonderful solution. All right, that was easy. Have a good weekend.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.560]   You too, sir. I like that. Let's see if we can do it again. We go to the great city of New York.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:34.000]   New York, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today? New York City, 646 area code. Go ahead,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.840]   please. Hey, Josh. That's you. Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, hey. No, thanks for taking the time. I'm
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:49.440]   really enjoying the show. I'm trying to leave my corporate job. I make about 225 plus bonus.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:07:00.160]   I've been working on a part-time, other stream of income, basically selling options premium,
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:06.000]   getting about 2% a month pretty consistently, but on a relatively small account, not enough
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.120]   to leave my job. So I figure I need to grow this to probably about 400,000 to cover our monthly
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:20.640]   expenses. And as you know, the Northeast is still pretty expensive. We're trying to sell our
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.000]   apartment in New York City, which is tough with the pandemic. Everyone's leaving, but we're
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.640]   expecting at about 500,000 from that, that I can contribute to some of this strategy.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:41.760]   So just wanted to get your thoughts on some things to think about when trying to leave
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:48.000]   corporate America, because I know you've done it. I mean, I have one kid, another kid on the way
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.480]   with the wife, the family of four. And so one of the things I'm thinking about is the health
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.760]   insurance costs, which I know are going to be pretty high because we're going to stay in the
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.760]   Northeast after we sell. But just curious what other things you would think about or plan to do.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.960]   How old is your oldest child?
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.000]   Two years old.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:21.360]   Okay. Well, what you will find as you trace this through is the prison of the corporate experience
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:30.640]   is entirely in your head. And what I mean is you have a set of constraints
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.160]   that you are choosing to operate under. Now, notice I'm being very precise in my language.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.000]   I'm not saying you've adopted them, right? They may have been imposed on you by the society around
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.880]   and you unconsciously adopted them, or you may have chosen these constraints, but they are
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:50.000]   constraints that you are choosing to operate under. And what I want to do is I want to make
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.960]   them clear to you so that you can make a conscious choice as to whether you want to accept them
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:04.560]   or not. You have a certain lifestyle that you live and a certain set of things that you do,
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.600]   a certain set of expenses that you have that you're concerned about and planning for,
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.960]   and I applaud you for that. That's not a bad thing. But every single one of these expenses,
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:21.760]   every single one of these things is entirely negotiable, completely negotiable. So, you need
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.480]   to face that and then make the choice intentionally. So, living in the Northeast,
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.720]   you choose to live in the Northeast for reasons that are important to you, but personal reasons.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.600]   You could choose to live in the Northeast or you could choose to live somewhere else.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:42.160]   Now, if you choose to live in the Northeast, because, again, most likely this is where my
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.080]   family is, where our friends are, like this is where our community is, that's obviously an
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:53.280]   entirely valid constraint, then you choose to live there and that brings with it certain
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:59.120]   baked-in costs to life, certain lifestyle benefits, certain costs associated with those benefits.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:04.080]   I hope that you're hearing my tone. I'm not saying those are wrong choices. I'm saying
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.640]   they're choices. You could choose to move somewhere else, right? You could choose to
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:15.280]   move to Mississippi and for the cost of your small, you know, the apartment in New York,
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.080]   you could buy a mansion in Mississippi. So, you may or may not want to do that. Some people
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.720]   couldn't imagine living in Mississippi. Some people would do it in an instant.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.600]   You could choose to do, if you're trading, if you're selling option premiums, you could do
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.720]   that anywhere in the world. As I like to famously, not famously, but I like to say, you know, you
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.200]   could load up your family, you could get on an airplane and you could fly to Chiang Mai, Thailand,
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:42.160]   and where you can live like a king on the beach in Chiang Mai, Thailand for a thousand dollars a
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:51.040]   month and pile up all of the extra money if you wanted to make a radical lifestyle change.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:56.720]   Now, let's assume that you don't want to make a physical move, which I think you should consider.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.200]   You know, if I were a trader, if I were trying to make a change from a corporate job to working as
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:08.560]   a trader, I would very seriously think about things like Puerto Rico with the Act 22 individual,
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:15.760]   the tax benefits for investors, the potential to massively adjust my taxes would be a major
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.240]   incentive to me if I'm moving into trading, the lifestyle. Some people would love it. Some people
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.720]   hate it, right? You have to think that through. So I would very seriously think about it. Myself,
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:34.080]   I would rather move quickly and not live under a $200,000 a year requirement until I had gotten
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.520]   my piggy bank very full. So if I talked to my wife and I said, "Honey, why don't we live on
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.680]   the beach for a few years?" And she said, "Okay, I could do it." I'd move to Thailand. I'd live
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.240]   there for a couple of years while I'm getting this thing going so that I never have any concerns
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.600]   about the actual trading strategy that I'm totally good. And then I would go ahead and move back to
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.960]   New York if I wanted to at that point in time. Now, there may be a cost. Maybe you want to be
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.120]   close to parents and you need the help in your family. Again, totally reasonable things. I'm
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:07.040]   just analyzing from a financial perspective. Now, if you say, "I want to stay," the other
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.000]   aspects that you're choosing, most of the costs that we choose are costs that we've adopted,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.520]   the kind of apartment that you live in, the size of the house that you have, the kind of
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.560]   ways that you spend your time and the things that you go, where you go. And so all of those things
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.480]   are chosen. You could live in an apartment that was half the cost of what your current one is.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.760]   You could spend half the money that you currently spend. And then that might change your lifestyle
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:38.720]   in some way. It might change your operations. So I don't want to go on. I want to point out that
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:45.440]   all of these things are entirely of your choosing. And so for you to believe that you have to make
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.640]   $400,000 from trading in order for things to work, that's nonsense, right? That's a choice.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.960]   You might say, "I want to make $400,000 in order for us to live the lifestyle we want to live in,"
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:00.880]   but you don't have to do any of that. So once you break those prisons in your mind and you realize
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.360]   that these are all intentional choices that I make, then you can use the appropriate language,
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.560]   which is, "I'm choosing to continue in my corporate job," or, "I'm choosing to do my
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.040]   trading strategy until I reach this certain point because that's the way that I want to live."
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:21.280]   Totally fine. Now, as far as strategy, I personally think that when you're making a
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.480]   move like that, the more conservative your move can be, the better you'll feel.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.800]   I don't think it's necessary to be fully conservative. There's lots of people who
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:37.600]   have started a business and who have done it with big personal expenses and been totally fine. I
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:43.200]   think you can do that. Me personally, I always feel better when I am more conservative, when
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:49.760]   I have lots of wiggle room. And so what I would do is I would run a couple of expense scenarios,
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.480]   and I would say, "Let's say I spend $200 a year. Let's say I spend $100 a year, and let's say I
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.920]   spend $50." And then I would model the size of my portfolio, my expected gains, and I would ask
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:05.680]   myself, "What would be the benefit 5, 10, 15, and 20 years from now if I live at these different
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.200]   lifestyles?" And if my wife and I could look at one of those outcomes and say, "Hey, look at where
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.840]   we'd be 10 years from now if we could get these returns that I've been getting and proving,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:21.120]   and we could have this much extra money and this extra capital to smooth out some of the risks,"
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   I've always found it easier to change expenses. And I think it's important to recognize that
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.600]   you'll never be as free as you are right now in the future. Your two-year-old doesn't care
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.120]   where he or she sleeps, and your baby's not going to care where he or she sleeps.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.720]   Your wife will care, but you can work with her and find a solution that works for the two of you.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.160]   But that's very different than if you have a 15-year-old. Because if you have a 15-year-old,
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.440]   now you've got a whole other set where you're like, "Well, my child has friends,
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.720]   and is it right for me to take my child out of her school and go somewhere else?" But right now,
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.720]   you have total freedom of choice. You're totally unencumbered. So I think that's a special time
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:04.160]   in life, and that if you're going to make this move, I think that, again, if your wife is open
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.680]   to it, I think that you should do something that allows you to make it quickly and just cut your
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:17.200]   expenses through some useful strategic system in your personal expenses so that you can make
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.800]   the move quicker. That's what I would do. That's really helpful. I appreciate it.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:31.440]   Lots to think about. Yeah. In general, if you can find something that's exciting
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:38.480]   versus something that's a trade-down. So in trying to help people break these prisons of their mind,
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:45.120]   what I have come to do is I've realized that you have to give a good story.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:51.120]   And so years ago, I remember I had a client of mine. He was a highly paid sales executive,
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.440]   and he got fired. I don't remember why he got fired, but he was living the lifestyle. And I
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:01.600]   remember just the sense of panic that he had about the idea of downgrading his lifestyle.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.640]   And he eventually didn't have the money to pay for the kids' private school, and he had to pull
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:13.440]   the kids out of private school. And he felt like such a failure as a father because he had to tell
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:18.800]   his children, "I can't pay the school tuition. I got to pull you out of school." And he really
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.680]   struggled with his self-esteem with regard to his friends because he'd always done well. He'd
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.800]   always made a lot of money, and he'd always had – he'd always done well. He'd always made a lot
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:34.960]   of money. He'd always had the ability to be perceived as someone who was a winner, which he
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.200]   was, right? He just didn't save a lot of money. And so when he got fired, he was left with a short
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.840]   with a difficult – in a difficult financial place, and he couldn't find a job quickly for
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:52.880]   some reason. So what I learned is that the most important thing to cover in this kind of planning
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.480]   is the story that you tell mom and dad, the story that you tell your children, and the story that
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.240]   you tell your friends. And I've learned that if you can make up some story that is true,
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:13.440]   but that is the kind of story that's socially acceptable, but also has the side benefits that
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.280]   you want, it's a lot better. So I've often counseled people who are leaving a job, right?
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.200]   Like, "Listen, is mom sick? Why don't you just say – instead of saying, 'I'm leaving the job
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.600]   because I don't like you,' just, 'I need to take care of mom. I need to go spend more time with my
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:30.160]   mom,' or, 'I have personal family things that I need to attend to.'" It's much more socially
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.120]   acceptable to say things like that. If you're going to – if you need to – if you ran out of money
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:39.920]   and you've got to quit your job, or you're running out of money and you can't afford your house
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.560]   anymore, can you make some, like, crazy move? Like, "We're going to move into a tiny home because
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.040]   we're becoming green minimalists, and we're going to buy everything in reusable containers and stop
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.920]   using plastic because we're wacky, like, green minimalists, not we're broke." That's a much more
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.360]   socially acceptable thing to say than we're broke, and it can solve kind of this problem.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.640]   So, if you decide that you're going to do something extreme so that you can make your
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:10.240]   business jump faster, if you need it, you've got to create some kind of story that you and your
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.960]   wife are really going to buy into and that you can tell your friends so that it's a matter of,
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.240]   "Hey, here's the exciting new thing that we're doing. We're moving to Thailand, right? This is
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:24.000]   exciting." Not, "We're moving from living on $200,000 a year to living on $15,000 a year
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.560]   just for two years so that I can build up my portfolio to a million five, and then I'll be
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:34.320]   totally, you know, then I'm set for the rest of my life." So, think about the story and craft some
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.880]   story that is true, or at least true enough that you can say it and not feel like you're lying to
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:45.840]   somebody, but that is socially acceptable so it keeps your options open. >>Yeah, that's great.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.320]   Yeah, the other piece is my wife's dad is in a facility, and we were going to move him into our
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:57.040]   house. But I do like the idea of, say, the Puerto Rico potential, just kind of leave it all and
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.640]   head down there for the tax advantages and the nice weather. >>If I were a trader and if I liked,
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.400]   I mean, you got to like Puerto Rico. You got to find some place that you like because you got to
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.520]   be on the island, you know, at least six months a year. But if I were a trader and I knew it was
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:17.200]   unlikely for me to give up my US citizenship, I can't see why I wouldn't take advantage of those
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.560]   tax considerations. It just smooths. Once you start getting some tax efficiency in your life,
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.120]   which you haven't had in a very long time living in New York City, right? But once you
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:31.200]   start getting some tax efficiency in your life, you realize that often one of your biggest enemies
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.920]   in this stuff is tax. And it gives you such an advantage where you can pursue different strategies.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:44.320]   It's compelling. So, you got to build a lifestyle that you like. And so, I would not live in Puerto
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.480]   Rico if I didn't like it. And if my wife didn't like it and we weren't happy, it's just not worth
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:53.360]   it. Saving on tax is not worth being unhappy. But if you could build something where everyone was
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.320]   happy and you enjoyed the sunshine and you visited New York in the winter, sorry, in the summer,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.920]   things like that, then it's really compelling. And the cut of the lower costs of living
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:11.280]   from the cost of living, the lifestyle changes and the tax benefits is really compelling,
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.120]   in my opinion. >> Yeah, thank you so much.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.280]   >> My pleasure. Good luck to you on things. I hope that it continues to be a winning strategy
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.320]   for you. That's awesome news. And tell you what, talk about the dream of being able to make a
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.920]   living from around the world. Being an independent options trader is awesome. All right, we go now
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.320]   to Naperville, Illinois. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:41.600]   Illinois, 630 phone number. >> Hi, Joshua. This is Silpa.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.080]   >> Welcome. Tell me your name again, please. >> My name is Silpa.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:51.840]   >> Silpa. Okay, go ahead. >> Yes. I'm a big fan. I have listened to a lot of your
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:21:00.800]   beginning podcast. First time caller, thanks for taking our call. And actually, we are from
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:09.600]   Cincinnati. And this question is regarding a house that we are living in right now.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:21.840]   So this is a four bedroom size house. We need bigger house. And we already liked one. We already
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:29.520]   have signed a contract for one. All that is going good. The question is, should we keep this house,
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:39.280]   because we can afford it, put it on rent, and keep living in the new house? That's option one.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:49.280]   And option two is, of course, sell this house and move on. So we bought this house four years back,
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.440]   and whatever details you need, I think I'm ready with those.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.240]   >> Is the house a good house for renting? Would it rent at a high market rent? Is it a good rental
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:10.720]   house? >> Yeah, in any case, this house is sort of good house in the sense the location is really
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:17.040]   good. The school district is one of the top most in just in country or at least in Cincinnati for
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:24.560]   sure. So it's very much this location and there are not many houses on market, of course, anywhere,
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:31.920]   but at least in this area, in this right bucket that we are looking at. We bought this house four
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:38.000]   years back, we are getting decent equity out of it. So in either case, renting or selling,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:46.320]   in either case, we will, so if we rent, right, the estimate is that, conservative estimate is that
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:57.120]   we'll get $2,500 a month. And with that, we can say this house, the mortgage on this house will
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:04.000]   get paid off from that rent and then we'll save some money, which we can use for the newer house,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.560]   like for the mortgage of the newer house. >> If you sold this house and took the equity
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:18.080]   that you have, what would you do with that money? >> Yeah, so that's the case. So we can, I mean,
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:28.800]   first thing is we will pay some amount of mortgage on the new house, right, we'll at least do 20%
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:36.560]   or maybe a little more than that. Right now we are making 10% down payment. So we can definitely
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:41.600]   pay back some more mortgage. And then we are planning that, I mean, our initial calculation
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:52.000]   shows that we'll still have 100K left over. So right now the rough plan is that over the span
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.960]   of next one year, we'll keep investing in market, just because we don't know what else to do.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:05.920]   >> Well, let me talk through this and tell you the factors that you can consider
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:11.840]   as you make this decision. There's not a right or a wrong decision, and it sounds like either
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:19.280]   one of these decisions would be fine. So you're not going to have a clear, yes, I should do this
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:23.280]   or no, I shouldn't do this. Because from what you're describing, it sounds like either decision
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:29.760]   will be fine for you. But what you can think about is as I go through some of these factors,
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:35.680]   does one of these speak to me, does one of these feel better than another? The first thing that
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:41.600]   you want to think about is, do I actually want to be a landlord? Do I want to own a rental house?
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.200]   For some people, the answer is yes. For many people, the answer is no. For many people,
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:53.280]   they say, I want to just live in a house. I want to do my investing in my 401k and buy mutual funds.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:58.480]   My mutual funds don't call me at night. My mutual funds don't disappear in the middle of the night
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:04.240]   when I have to go and find new renters. My mutual funds are simple, and that way we have a house we
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:10.400]   live in. We have 401ks with mutual funds in them. It's enough money for us. And we like to have our
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.160]   hobbies and hang out with our friends on the weekends. I don't want to be in real estate.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:21.520]   If you don't want to be in real estate, then you should sell this house and then feel free to put
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.760]   the money into your next house or do something else with it. That's the first thing. The second
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:33.040]   thing has to do with, would I spend the money in some way? So for example, you could sell this
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:37.760]   house and take the money and invest it into something else, invest it into your new house
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:42.880]   or invest it into another business or another investment or buy more stocks or whatever you
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.720]   want to invest the money in. Or you could say, I want to spend it. So if you want to spend it,
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.960]   then of course you sell the house and spend the money. But let's assume we're not going to spend
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.120]   the money. And so we're trying to figure out what should we do while investing the money.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:02.080]   In general, I would like you to own more investment assets. So I like the idea of you're
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   keeping this house if it's a good rental house. There are many houses that we might choose to
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:14.800]   live on that are simply not good rental houses, or at least they're not good rental houses compared
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:25.760]   to the alternative. You might live on a beautiful rural property with a big barn and all these
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:32.160]   wonderful facilities. It's perfect for you to live in. But if you go and try to rent it, you can't
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.480]   rent it for very much because the number of people who are interested in renting that house from you
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.680]   is very small and they don't have much money. And so there are some properties that are simply
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:47.920]   not good rental properties. They're better for owners. And so you ask yourself, is this the kind
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:52.160]   of property that's a good rental property? From what you said, it probably is. The other thing
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:59.600]   you want to ask yourself is, is this a good time to own a rental property? You want to do an analysis
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:06.880]   of the values that houses are selling for versus the cost of the rents. And try to ask yourself,
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:13.120]   is this a renter's market? Is this a buyer's market? Is this a seller's market? For example,
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.120]   I'm renting the house that I live in right now. I'm renting it from somebody. It's a beautiful
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.120]   house. It's a large house. I have a large property. I have a beautiful garden. It's a beautiful house.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:34.160]   I would never buy this house. Why? Well, because in my local market, the house would sell. If I
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:41.520]   bought this house, it would sell for something like $250,000. My rental cost on it pre-COVID
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:47.520]   were $1,000 a month. Right now, my rental costs are $600 a month because my landlord cut my rents
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:52.880]   during COVID. So I have this large, beautiful house and a big property that I'm renting for
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:28:00.160]   $600 per month. It would be crazy for me to buy this house considering the fact that I can rent
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   it for $600 per month. So you do a market analysis in your local area and say, is it good for us to
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:11.760]   buy houses, to sell houses, or to rent houses in the current market? And that's just a practical
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:20.320]   example of what I mean when I talk about analyzing your market. Is this a good time to own a rental
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:25.920]   house? It's entirely fine to be an investor and to look down at your portfolio and say,
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:34.240]   "You know what? If I look down at my portfolio and I see that somebody is willing to offer me
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:39.760]   a crazy high sum of money because houses are selling like crazy, then you sell." You sell
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.560]   when someone wants to give you a lot of money. You put the money in the bank and you wait for
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.880]   a few years. And then when the market changes, you go ahead and buy. Now, it doesn't feel like
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.400]   that's going to happen. It always feels like, "Well, I can't sell now because I'm not going
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.680]   to be able to buy again." Eventually, things will change unless there's some underlying current or
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:02.320]   trend where things eventually change. And so I wouldn't be scared to sell the house and then
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.920]   just simply sit on the money and wait to buy if the house prices are overvalued at the moment in
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.680]   my current analysis. So you need to look at that. The next thing that you want to look at
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.600]   is you want to consider the costs of selling now versus the costs of selling later.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.880]   You should be aware of the fact that if you bought this house six years ago and you have a good bit
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:29.280]   of appreciation in the house, you can sell it and get that appreciation tax-free, up to $500,000
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:35.760]   for a couple married filing jointly. That's powerful. And I like the idea of taking tax-free
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:42.880]   money. So if you have $150,000 of appreciation and you can sell with modest selling expenses,
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:49.200]   minimal realtor costs, minimal selling expenses, etc., and take that money in appreciation, then
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.240]   that would be really great to have that money tax-free because now you have a gain that you'll
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:59.920]   never pay tax on. And then I would go back to the real estate strategy and I would say,
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:05.840]   "What would I be willing to do? Would I be willing to buy more properties with this money?"
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:12.080]   So let me tell you what I think would be kind of okay, a good decision, a good decision,
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.800]   and a great decision depending on what you wanted to do. I think an okay decision would
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:24.800]   be to simply sell the house because you want to sell this house and take the money and put
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.640]   the house, put the money down into your next house. That would be okay, especially if you
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.240]   didn't want to be involved in real estate. Totally fine. That would be a totally okay decision.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:40.960]   A good decision would be to keep this house and buy the next house and keep this house as a rental
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:45.280]   because everything's already squared away with it. You know the house, the house has financing
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.600]   already done. It's a good decision. And now you own more real estate and now you have a rental
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:54.000]   income that can pay the mortgage and pay and give you some extra money. That's a very good decision
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.880]   if you're willing to deal with the hassles of renting the house out or having it rented for you.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:06.480]   I think a great decision would be to try that and then say, "Okay, we want to do real estate." And
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:14.160]   then I would say, "How can I leverage this house to expand my real estate investment portfolio?"
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:21.680]   So one option might be to sell this house, take the money tax-free, and put the money in the bank,
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:26.720]   and then next year buy one or two or three other houses that are rental houses.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:35.840]   Because if I could take $150,000 tax-free and then use that $150,000 to buy three other rental
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:41.600]   properties, put $50,000 down on each of them, and I could leverage my gain in this first house
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:48.480]   to now own four houses, the three rentals plus the one that I'm living in, that's a better solution
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:54.400]   than owning only two houses. And with those other houses, being able to do that with my tax-free
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.120]   money would be a really good way to invest it. If you thought that this house, however, is a perfect
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:05.920]   rental house and you don't want to have the selling expenses, you don't have realtor fees,
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:11.680]   etc., of selling it, then you could also just take it and maybe increase the mortgage on it and use
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:18.880]   that mortgage to go ahead and buy another property. So in summary, any of these are fine decisions,
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.240]   and what you choose will probably depend on whether you see yourself as being a real estate
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:29.520]   investor or not. If you do, you could use this house to launch you in that direction. If you
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:37.040]   don't see yourself as being a real estate investor, then it's better for you to simply go ahead and
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.960]   just sell this one and move into the next one. Shruti Gupta
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:49.440]   Okay. Yeah, that's a great way to look at it. But if we, and as a person, I don't want to be in real
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:57.200]   estate, and I'm sure my husband, he also, I mean, we like our jobs. We are very comfortable and we
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:05.120]   like what we do. So considering that we don't want to be landlords, the bigger question is,
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:12.640]   then what do we do with that extra money? Because the thing is, I believe in diversification
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:21.920]   and diversification of assets. We already have so much in the stock market and some in cash.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:30.800]   So I mean, is there any other better asset that we can own? Am I missing something?
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:36.080]   Dave: You'll have to think through those three asset classes that I discussed previously
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:42.320]   in today's show and ask yourself, am I excited about owning any of those asset classes?
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:47.520]   Is there something else that I'm excited about owning? If the answer is yes, then you should
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:54.400]   invest in that. There may be many things that you could, you can invest in all kinds of things.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.160]   But if none of those are exciting, there's nothing wrong with just simply investing in the stock
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.720]   market and paying off your house. So what I would say is if you don't want to be landlords, sell the
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:11.440]   house now so that you can get the tax-free gain on it and have that tax-free appreciation. And
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.440]   then just go ahead and if you don't have anything to invest the money in, just go ahead and pay off
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.840]   your mortgage on the new house or pay down the mortgage on the new house. That way it's still
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:25.440]   in real estate. It's still diversified. You'll have protection from the asset protection due to
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.400]   it being your personal residence. And then when your mortgage is paid off, you will still have
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:35.120]   to decide what to invest the money in later, but at least you'll enjoy having a paid off mortgage.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:42.160]   I think that's fine. Okay. Okay. Thank you. My pleasure. That's a great topic.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.920]   Thank you. Congratulations on all your success and thank you for calling in. All right. Two
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.480]   callers left. We go to John in Pennsylvania. John, welcome to the Chalk and I serve you today, sir.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:01.920]   Hi, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call. You may think you're famous for telling people to move
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:07.120]   to Chiang Mai, Thailand, but in this house, since your show two days ago, you're famous for the 10
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:12.960]   minute bath of four children. I think that's more impressive than anything else I've ever heard you
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:19.040]   say. I could give you my whole checklist if you want. It's challenging. I continually find a stray.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:23.920]   There's always a stray that's just wandering downstairs to go find a stuffed animal or
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.440]   lingering over dinner. My biggest problem right now is my eldest has developed the habit of
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.520]   lingering over dinner. I've got the other three in and out and I'm like, "Where's number four?"
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:38.400]   I keep doing it. I keep working on it. That's the most impressive credential. I think
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.840]   companies should be studying your efficiency and optimization. That's very kind.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:49.920]   My mouth hit the floor when I heard that one. Anyways, sorry. On to my question. It's a fairly
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:36:03.120]   boring one this time. Last year, I had to roll back Roth contributions because I wasn't planning
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.520]   correctly for the income limits we were hitting, which was a fine thing. We had to roll it back and
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:17.520]   we got it all sorted out. Recently, my company... After that, I looked into, I think they're just
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.320]   called Back to Roth and found that that wasn't going to be a good solution for me because
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:27.520]   it required you to not have any other assets in a traditional IRA, which I did.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:31.440]   It looked like it was going to be very complicated or cause a big taxable event
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:37.120]   to move those things out, which I didn't want to do. I shelved it and said, "Okay, that's not for
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.280]   me or it's too complicated or just not worth it." Then my company recently has announced that
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:48.240]   they're allowing additional after-tax contributions to a Roth and they're enabling this through a
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:54.640]   program at work. They're going to take all the hardship out of it to do this mega Back to Roth,
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:01.600]   where we can contribute these additional after-tax dollars. Then there's a mechanism
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:08.800]   set in for into the program where it'll automatically roll it into a Roth and makes
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:13.280]   it pain-free to do this mega Back to Roth. Seems like a no-brainer. I'm probably going to do it.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.640]   There seemed to be something in there, though. There was a hitch about a five-year,
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:27.520]   I don't know what you call it, a maturing period of five years where the gains are not tax-free.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:35.840]   I'm wondering how that works and if that's the same mechanism that's talked about in
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:41.360]   Roth conversion ladders. It seems like it's the other side of the same thing,
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:47.600]   but I'm not really sure what's going on internally there and how it could be problematic.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:54.240]   And really, the last question about that or related to that is, I read a show a long time
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:00.800]   ago saying basically contributing to a Roth or basically qualified plans in large part can be
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:07.760]   good even if you think you're going to be withdrawing it early and have to take the
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.320]   penalty or something like that. I think you had done some math from a caller that said it's really
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:19.360]   advantageous even in the worst case. So that's kind of why I was going to jump on doing this
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.800]   mega Back to Roth. And I'm not sure if there's anything about the mega Back to Roth that
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.680]   does not apply to what you had said about go ahead and contribute even if you think you have
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.960]   to take that later. In order for you to make your mega Back to Roth contributions, will you be
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:39.440]   reducing your traditional contributions or are you maxing your traditional contributions and
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:47.680]   this will be in addition to those contributions? In addition with the caveat that I guess just
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:55.120]   since I'm disqualified this particular year, I won't be giving to a normal Roth IRA for me and
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:01.680]   I'm sorry, yeah, Roth IRA for me and my wife because I'm disqualified from those.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.520]   So understood. Yeah.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.160]   This will be an addition to the other. We don't have 401k matching, but we have a 401k,
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.600]   so I'll be matching that up.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:17.840]   Right. So your answer to this question is important for your allusion to my show where I
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:23.920]   talked about how it's better to put money into a traditional 401k and then withdraw it when you're
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:29.440]   not working for early retirement and pay the 10% penalty than it is to put money into a taxable
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:36.560]   account at which you could then use to pay for early retirement and not without any penalty.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:45.520]   So specifically, my opinions are that number one, any employee, anybody who has a fairly normal
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:52.160]   expected wealth distribution coming from a job should contribute to a traditional 401k
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:58.880]   and not contribute to a Roth 401k. So that's for a 401k only. I'm not talking about traditional IRA
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:06.720]   versus Roth IRA. I'm saying any employee who has a normal expected financial picture, which is
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.560]   I'm going to work my job, I'm going to take some percentage of my income, put the money into the
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:17.360]   investment account. At some point in time, I'm going to stop working, I'm going to retire,
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:22.640]   and I'm going to live on that portfolio. My answer is anybody who's in that situation
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:30.880]   should not fund a Roth 401k. Rather, they should fund a traditional 401k from a tax perspective.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:37.120]   It's better. Now, I'm still okay with Roth IRA contributions. And so who should contribute to
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:45.440]   a Roth IRA? Well, anybody who is qualified for a Roth IRA should contribute to a Roth IRA
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:54.880]   because a Roth IRA, notice I'm not saying Roth 401k, I'm saying a Roth IRA has some things that
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.320]   are different than just tax savings, most specifically the ability to withdraw the
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:06.800]   contributions with no penalties, and that's helpful and valuable. So if I'm coaching an 18-year-old,
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:14.080]   my 18-year-old son who has an earned income of $15,000, well, first of all, of course,
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:20.080]   my 18-year-old son has no income tax on $15,000, but I'm still going to say put the money in the
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.960]   Roth IRA, even if that's just simply his emergency fund. I'm going to say put your emergency fund in
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:30.160]   a Roth IRA because you can always take the money out for emergencies, and now you get creditor
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:36.800]   protection and you get tax benefits with that account. If my 18-year-old is earning $100,000,
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:44.720]   I'm going to say max out your 401k, if available, and put money in the Roth IRA. If my 18-year-old
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:51.840]   is making $200,000, let's say I'm doing a good job as a parent, right? My 18-year-old is making
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:58.080]   $200,000. I'm going to say max out your 401k, but now you don't qualify for a Roth IRA.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:04.000]   So now the question is, in addition to the 401k, is there something else that we can do? Well,
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.640]   now we could do a backdoor Roth or we could do a mega backdoor Roth, which is what you're talking
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   about. So the mega backdoor Roth is an employer-sponsored plan that allows you to make
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:20.320]   after-tax contributions which become a Roth contribution. So now your question is about
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:29.760]   the five-year rule for those contributions. Agreed so far? So the question on the five-year rule,
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:37.520]   first of all, for the five-year rule for Roth IRA withdrawals is to determine if the earnings
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:43.120]   from those withdrawals are tax-free. And so in order for them to be tax-free, it has to be on
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:48.400]   or after the date that you turn 59 and a half, and then it has to be at least five tax years
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:55.920]   after the first contribution to any Roth IRA you own. That's the rule there. On the mega backdoor
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:05.120]   Roth, just hold on, just went all cloudy in my head. I think I know what you're... So I have
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:10.720]   a statement in front of me. Yeah, go ahead. It says five years from each in-plan Roth conversion
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.920]   is rather than the first. Right, right, right. Which is five years from the first Roth, yeah.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:22.640]   Right. So I guess the technical detail just went cloudy right as I was talking about it. So let me
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:29.440]   just say this. I see no reason not to participate in the mega backdoor Roth, even with the five-year
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.600]   rule. The five-year rule is not going to change. It's the same no matter what. So even with the
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:39.440]   five-year rule, I see no reason for you not to contribute to the mega backdoor Roth as long as
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.120]   you are separately maxing out your traditional contributions. And then that situation, I think
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.880]   it's an awesome plan and it would be great if everybody offered it. I'm not sure that this is
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:56.640]   going to hang around very much. I think that the backdoor Roth and the mega backdoor Roth,
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:05.120]   I think that this goes against the political ethos of our time. People say it smells of things that
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:13.520]   only the rich can do. And I think that the Roth IRA rules are so nice in terms of tax freedom
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.160]   forever. And I think that there's so many big Roth IRAs being created now that I think that this is
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.360]   a tax exclusion that's probably going to be tightened up in the future. So I would participate
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:30.800]   now and do it. I don't expect this to last around for very long myself. Yeah, thank you. I agree
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:36.480]   with all that. I was just trying to figure out if there was some hook as to what I wasn't thinking
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:42.480]   of. And I know these can be rolled back if they don't meet the qualifications or some kind of,
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.000]   I can't remember what they call it. There's something for highly compensated individuals
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.760]   if they don't get enough of us rank and file people to contribute, then they get disqualified
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:56.400]   and all have to get rolled back if only the executives do it. But yeah, that sounds like
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:02.960]   a good plan. I appreciate the context and to solidify my decision here. So I appreciate it.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.880]   My pleasure. All right. For our last call of the day, we go to David in the location of none.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:16.320]   Well done, David. My screen has you completely geographically anonymous. So welcome to the show.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.720]   How can I serve you today, sir? Hi Joshua. I was calling to get a recommendation
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:31.520]   on what I should do with a pretty large brokerage account is over a million from an asset privacy
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:38.640]   and an asset protection point of view. Now, I don't own a business or really do risky things
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:44.800]   and just a regular employee, so I don't expect any type of litigation. And I do like to keep my
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:50.320]   finances pretty simple, but it is a large amount that's not protected. So I just wanted to see
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:58.480]   what you thought about the pros and cons and does it make sense to do some type of offshore trust or
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:05.360]   any other structure? Do you have other assets in addition to this brokerage account?
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:14.960]   Yes, but in retirement accounts. Okay. Do you have any significant litigation risk or
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.720]   credit risk in some way due to your day-to-day business dealings?
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:26.640]   No. I don't know whether I should ask it. You're living in the United States under US law or
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.000]   are you living in the United States? Yes.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:37.040]   Okay. So your choices are a few. So first of all, you should ask yourself,
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:45.280]   is there an asset or a series of assets that are excluded from the claims of creditors
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:51.520]   that I'm interested in owning? So can I max out my 401(k) this year? That would be really great.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:57.280]   Is there a state that I can live in? So for example, you don't need a trust if you live
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.320]   in Florida and you buy a million dollar house to live in. You live in Florida, you have a million
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.440]   dollar house, that million dollar house is protected from the claims of creditors.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:13.120]   Maybe in Florida you could take advantage of the annuity laws and life insurance laws.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.840]   You could buy a million dollar annuity and if you are a Florida resident, then that annuity will be
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:26.080]   exempt from the claims of creditors. It's an exempt asset. And so you should look at are there
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:31.520]   any exemptions that I can take advantage of? If there are exemptions, that's going to be your
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:40.160]   simplest way that you can invest the money that's going to provide you with the asset and creditor
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:46.640]   protection that you're looking for. So it's very important to always focus on exemptions because
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:53.520]   those are the cheapest options. When you start establishing asset protection trusts, those asset
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:48:00.560]   protection trusts come with a set of fees and costs. And so you need to be aware of whether
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:06.080]   it's worth it based upon your overall profile. If you don't have a high profile or you're not
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:16.000]   engaged in a litigious business, my guess is it's probably not worth worrying too much about asset
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.200]   protection. Insure properly, have an umbrella liability policy on your primary house.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:27.200]   But if you're just a normal person, I'm imagining you're a computer programmer, you write a little
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:34.720]   bit of software, you don't have a big public facing business, there's just not that much risk.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:39.200]   So if you get in a car accident, could somebody sue you for that? Yes. But it's easier to go ahead
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:46.960]   and just buy ample liability protection on your car insurance policy and to purchase, again,
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.760]   an umbrella liability policy on your home than it is for you to establish an offshore asset
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:49:00.320]   protection trust. So think about exempt assets. Number two, ask yourself how it would work for you
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:07.520]   with a strategy of privacy versus a strategy of protection. So remember that when planning
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:14.400]   for asset protection, privacy is a valid strategy. It's not ultimately a legally winning strategy,
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:21.280]   but it is a winning strategy for a long time. If you take the million dollars and take it and buy
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:27.600]   gold coins or a gold brick and you put it in an offshore gold depository somewhere,
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:33.120]   and it's not a bank account, that's not reportable to the IRS, not reportable to the government,
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:38.400]   just sits there, just sits in an offshore vault. So you're engaging in a privacy strategy here.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:43.600]   That asset is not going to appear as something that's available to a creditor.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.360]   So if a plaintiff's attorney is doing an asset search on you to try to figure out if you're
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.680]   worth suing or not, they're not going to find the gold bar sitting in an offshore vault.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:50:00.080]   It just doesn't exist. And so they're more likely to turn down the case because you're not a big
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:08.400]   fish. Now, if they sue you and if they win, and if you're now subject to a judgment creditor's
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:13.360]   legal deposition of how much money do you have, that would be the point in time which,
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:16.240]   of course, you have to decide, "Am I going to tell the truth?" But there's very
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:22.720]   compelling persuasive reasons to tell the truth. And in that situation, you would tell the truth,
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.160]   you say, "I have the million dollars." They would force you to deliver it up if they have control
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:32.960]   over your person. And then you now lose the money if they won the lawsuit. But remember,
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:39.040]   that's at the very end of a long set of lawsuits. So any kind of private asset or privacy-focused
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:45.520]   asset has a significant level of creditor protection. It's just not legal protection.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.440]   So if you put the million dollars into a cryptocurrency that was a privacy-oriented
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:54.880]   cryptocurrency, if you put the million dollars into buying a beautiful villa offshore,
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:51:02.960]   for US persons, the rules are that you need for it to be totally private and to be outside
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:09.280]   of the country offshore, it needs to be a physical asset, a physical asset that doesn't generate
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.120]   income because the income, you legally have to report the income. So physical asset that doesn't
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:18.480]   generate income would be physical property, real property, works really well, a house that you live
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:24.160]   in, a couple of houses around the world can work really well, maybe some land, a ranch somewhere,
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:29.280]   a couple of ranches, things like that, where they're oriented towards long-term capital gains
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:35.200]   appreciation rather than generating current rents. Also, any kind of physical property such as gold
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:43.200]   coins, silver coins, gold bricks, diamonds, Stradivarius violins, physical currency held
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:48.000]   offshore has no reporting requirements, etc. So that gives you asset protection. And then,
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.360]   of course, you can move into the—sorry, that gives you privacy. Then, of course,
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:58.640]   you can move into the world of cryptocurrency, especially some privacy-oriented coin.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:04.880]   So those are some good options for privacy. Now, the next thing is, do I need the trust?
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:12.160]   And so will the trust start to give you some form of actual legal protection? Yes. But what I would
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:21.360]   say is for either a privacy-oriented strategy or a strategy that involves a trust, you should be
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:29.600]   prepared yourself to move offshore as well. So the ultimate thing to remember is that even if you
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:34.320]   have a trust and you could—if your state has authorized the domestic asset protection trust
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:39.920]   legislation, that's a fruitful area of research. You could set up an offshore asset protection
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:43.440]   trust, talk to an attorney, talk about the custodian fees, what assets, what are we going
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:50.000]   to invest the money in, etc. You can put in place a springing strategy. That's a personal favorite
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.400]   of mine is go ahead and have a domestic-oriented trust, which is cheaper to own, but then have some
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:03.200]   clauses in there where if you come into danger and if you can't file a report with the trustee that
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:09.520]   you're free of any legal danger, that that trust springs offshore, that's a good solution.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:13.920]   I just think a million dollars is a little light. I don't think it's enough money for it to be worth
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:22.320]   it here. Your mileage may vary. I think it's not worth it with a million dollars. So I would
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:29.920]   pursue a privacy-related strategy and probably skip some of the legal protection, and then I
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:35.680]   would just be ready to move myself offshore if it were an extreme circumstance and I needed to do
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:41.440]   that. So always remember that even if you do go with some kind of offshore asset protection trust,
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:46.560]   you still need to be ready to move offshore yourself because what happens, the game of
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:52.240]   asset protection is a continual tug between a judge trying to rule in the interest of creditors,
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:54:00.400]   which judges don't like creditors getting not happening. Judges do not like if somebody sues
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:09.120]   you because you've wronged them and the court issues a judgment saying you owe this person
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.960]   money because you've wronged them. You lost the lawsuit. You've wronged them. You owe them money.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:20.800]   The judges don't look kindly upon someone saying, "Well, I'm sorry, judge. This money's just sitting
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.520]   offshore in an offshore asset protection trust, and I can't touch it." What does the judge do?
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:30.080]   Judge grabs you, tells the bailiff, "Take this guy to prison," says you're going to sit in prison
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:35.760]   until you cough up the money, and you have no choice because they have control over your person.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:41.440]   So if you recognize that that's the case with an offshore trust, even with the highest paid
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:48.240]   attorneys, with the best things, with a million dollars, I think you're in the direction of just
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:53.600]   simply pursue a privacy strategy with some of the investments, and then just simply position
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:58.160]   yourself that if you needed to disappear, disappear, and it's better to be free living
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:02.480]   offshore to let your attorney set a legal problems than for you to be stuck in some prison cell
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.560]   rotting where you can't do anything, can't make any money, et cetera, while you're working out
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.680]   the solution to settle the case. Did I answer your question, or did I just ramble on for 10 minutes?
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:20.320]   No, no. That's really helpful. That's really helpful. Yeah, my opinion, it didn't quite make
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:27.760]   sense to go with the hassle, not only from the cost, but also maintaining it for a million dollars
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:33.040]   itself. So that makes sense. I did want to ask you, do you think that doing consulting work,
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:42.640]   does that increase the risk or is having some type of errors and omissions insurance be enough
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:49.280]   to protect from that liability? It depends on how thoughtful you are about the advice that you give.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:56.160]   So I was formerly a licensed financial advisor. I had errors and omissions insurance, right? So
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:00.640]   what could somebody sue me over successfully? Because there's, in my opinion,
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.880]   I'm very concerned about the litigious society in the United States. I think it's a challenge,
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:16.480]   it's a problem, it's difficult. But I often think that the risk is overblown by people who profit
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:20.800]   from manufacturing this culture of concern, right? Earlier in this show, I answered a question on
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:29.120]   hyperinflation. I think that hyperinflation is a legitimate risk of any currency, but I think
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.800]   the hyperinflation of the dollar, is it a legitimate risk? I think it's a very legitimate
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:40.160]   risk. I think it's wildly overblown in terms of its likeliness and its severity by those who
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:45.760]   profit from hyping it extensively. And I'm not accusing people of doing it in bad faith. They
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:51.280]   might be, many people believe in what they're saying. I just think they're wrong based upon
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.280]   my analysis. I could be the one who's wrong, they could be the one who's wrong. So when we go to
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:01.680]   things like litigation risk, I think that a lot of it is overblown. Again, I read all the asset
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:07.920]   protection planning books, I study them, and I observe that the authors always point to specific
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:16.400]   cases that it did go the way they said. But it seems a little bit excessive to say, is it risk
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.120]   really that high? So let's go to errors and omissions, right? So I formerly was, I'm no
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:26.720]   longer, I don't have any licenses, but I used to be a licensed financial advisor. I used to give
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:33.920]   professional advice in that context. So let's say that I gave somebody bad advice. Well, if I gave
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:42.960]   sincere bad advice, if I gave sincere advice that just happened to be wrong because I couldn't
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:49.840]   foresee the future, I have no legal liability for that. If I said to you that I think that
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:55.280]   this stock is going to go up, and I'm a stockbroker, and I say that XYZ Corporation,
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.880]   I think there's a good reason that XYZ Corporation is going to go up. They're doing really well,
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:03.200]   they're in a business that's good. I think they're going to go up. And I recommend that you buy it.
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:07.680]   And I sell you a thousand shares of XYZ Corporation, and I make a commission on those
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:13.040]   shares. And then all of a sudden tomorrow, the news comes out that XYZ Corporation is going
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:20.320]   bankrupt and you lose all your money. You can't sue me, and I'm not liable to you for that advice
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:26.960]   as long as there's no fraud or there's no evidence of my somehow dealing in it, right? There's the
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:34.480]   prudent man rule. The question is, would an independent prudent man who is observing this
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:40.560]   data and this situation, would that man have made that recommendation? And if so, I'm safe, right?
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:49.440]   I don't owe you. My errors and omissions are not a... I'm not liable for being sincerely wrong.
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:53.760]   I'm liable for fraud. Absolutely. So if I had an inside deal and I knew it was going down,
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:59:00.560]   and I was just trying to do some pump and run, pump and dump scheme, and I told you it was going
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:04.880]   to go up, I sold it to you, and then it crashed, and then I turned around and I participated and
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:08.560]   colluded with others to buy it out at the bottom of the market, totally, I'm wrong.
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.160]   But even there, errors and omission insurance doesn't insure me against that. It doesn't
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:16.480]   insure me against fraud. It just insures me against errors and omissions. And so it's a
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:20.240]   very narrow... If you read your insurance contract, it's a very narrow definition.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:26.720]   So I'm not liable to be... I don't have a legal duty to be right in everything that I say.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:33.600]   What I have a legal duty to do is to be prudent in everything that I say. And so the advice that
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:39.360]   I've just given over the last two hours on this Q&A show is exactly the kind of advice that I
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:44.160]   would give you if you were a private consulting client. And as far as I can tell, I've been careful
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:48.960]   in what I've said, I've been thoughtful in what I've said, and I've not given any advice that
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:54.960]   is imprudent. And I've done a good job, or I try to always do a good job of disclosing if I think,
[01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:00.720]   "Well, here's where I think the errors might be." So in the financial space, the biggest concerns
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:05.280]   come down to representing insurance policies, right? So I don't tell people what to do with
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:09.440]   insurance. I don't sell insurance. I don't tell people to cancel insurance. I explain
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:14.720]   how insurance policies can work. I analyze them. I can do that work. And I have no...
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:19.680]   There's no liability there as long as I'm being prudent. When it comes to investments,
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:23.840]   the biggest thing comes down to forward-looking statements. So the statements that you make,
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:32.560]   do these statements... Are they prudent and are they acceptable? Which is why investment advisors
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:38.400]   operate under constraints that some people don't, to use accurate numbers, etc. So I guess in
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:46.880]   summary, I think that consulting is a relatively low-risk business as long as you're not committing
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:52.800]   fraud, as long as you're not participating in the marketplace in a crazy way, and as long as you're
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:59.120]   being actually prudent in your words. And errors and omission insurance specifically doesn't protect
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.600]   you against fraud, right? There's been lots of get-rich-quick gurus who have gone to prison,
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:10.400]   put there by the FTC because of their content. And were all of them right? I don't know. I haven't
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:17.040]   reviewed all the cases. But what I'd say is that if you're a prudent person, being a consultant
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:23.760]   doesn't raise a significant level of personal risk. You can't sue me because of anything that
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.480]   I've said here today in the last two hours. I've been thoughtful. I've been careful. I've been
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:34.240]   prudent in what I've said. There's no danger zone, no gray zone in anything that I've
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:39.840]   said in the last two hours. - Thanks. That was very helpful. Can I do one very quick follow-up?
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:46.320]   If I were to move, or would it be a good idea to move that brokerage account at least to
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:52.400]   like an international jurisdiction if I wanted to keep it in equities as opposed to getting what
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:58.000]   you were mentioning about real estate offshore? Would that help at all in terms of the privacy
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.080]   aspect? - By move, you mean move outside of the United States or move to a different state within
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:09.840]   the United States? - No, move the actual brokerage account to like a company or a bank that's in
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:17.600]   another country like a Swiss bank or something like that. - Yes, it does give you some benefits,
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:23.920]   but it does give you some drawbacks. So the first thing is, if you're moving the brokerage account
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:30.320]   and you're keeping it in either a brokerage account of some kind, a stock account, a trading account,
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:37.040]   or you are keeping it in a cash account of some kind of bank account, then you cannot own that
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.720]   privately under US tax law. You have to report that to the government. So it's entirely legal
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:48.960]   for you to take a million dollars and move it to a Swiss bank account, if they'll take you as a US
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:54.480]   person. It's entirely legal for you to take the money, move it to a Swiss, you know, actively
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:03:00.800]   invested account and have them invest the money and trade it for you. What you cannot do is not
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:05.920]   report that to the US government. You will have to file your annual disclosure forms for having
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:11.520]   offshore accounts and so the US government will know about that. Now here's the question,
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:18.160]   is that still a net gain? I don't know, right? In theory, and in practice actually,
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:25.760]   the United States is actually a tremendously private market, financial marketplace. So the
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:31.280]   United States of America is the world's biggest tax haven and one of the best tax havens in the
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:37.280]   world, largely due to privacy rules and privacy laws that are actually enforced to a higher degree
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:42.400]   than in some other places. I get very frustrated about the lack of financial privacy in the United
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:47.360]   States, but I have to concede that there's more privacy in the United States than in many other
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.840]   places in the world and that the privacy in the United States is more actively enforced than many
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:56.880]   places in the world. There are other jurisdictions that have higher laws, but those laws often aren't
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.640]   enforced. And so from a privacy perspective, I'm inclined to believe that the United States is
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:07.600]   actually not a bad place for you to have the money. Now does the US, so you have to ask who
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:13.200]   am I trying to have the privacy from? Who am I trying to have, who do I want to have privacy of
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:18.800]   the money? Am I concerned about a plaintiff's attorney having privacy of the money or am I
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.320]   concerned about the US government having privacy of the money? Those are two very different
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:26.880]   scenarios. I don't believe you're going to successfully hide your money from the US government
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:34.160]   unless you're doing a physical, and you're not, let me say this precisely, I don't believe you're
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:40.480]   going to be successful hiding your money from the US government. The US government, if you're a high
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:48.640]   priority target, the US government has almost unlimited power. If you're on the top 10 most
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:54.080]   wanted terrorists in the list in the world, the US government is filtering and reading every email
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:59.680]   that's sent around. They've got wiretaps all around the world. It's stunning, the level of
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:05.680]   spying that the US government engages in. And so if you're a high profile target, I don't believe
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:11.200]   that you are going to successfully in the long term successfully hide from the US government.
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:17.040]   Now, if you're not a high profile target, can you successfully hide? Of course you can. There's
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:22.800]   people who do it all the time. But I think the risk is not worth it because it's hard to sleep
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.240]   well at night if you have that floating over your shoulders. I'm convinced for those who want to
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:31.920]   hide from the US government, the simplest thing is just get the US government out of your life.
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:37.840]   Go get another citizenship, move to another place and renounce your US citizenship. Do it legally,
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:42.160]   get rid of them, and then you can be done with them. And it's much, much simpler to do it that
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:48.720]   way and much less risky in my opinion than trying to hide money. The US government has the whole
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:55.440]   world basically hooked around its fingers with FATCA. When FATCA passed, it changed everything.
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:06:00.400]   And everyone's, you know, most of the banks still want to do business in the United States. It's
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:06.080]   such an important financial hub that, you know, the old days of the 1980s, that stuff doesn't
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:09.680]   exist anymore, at least that I can find. Maybe I'm not rich enough to access it and it's still
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:15.200]   out there, but it doesn't exist anymore. So, if you're hiding money from the US government,
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:20.400]   I don't think it's possible and I don't think it's a worthy use of time. I think it's better
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:23.040]   if you're at that level, it's better to get rid of the US government,
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:28.400]   eliminate your obligation to the US government by formally renouncing citizenship,
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:32.960]   and then go on and live as a free person instead of being under the thumb of the US government.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.160]   Now, in terms of hiding from a plaintiff's attorney, that can absolutely be done,
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:43.120]   but I think it could be done in many different ways. So, what's unclear to me, because I've
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:48.960]   never worked in it, is I've always tried to figure out what mechanism is there for a plaintiff's
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:54.240]   attorney to actually disclose the asset, to actually find the asset. And there's a lot.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:07:00.080]   I have a book on how to do asset searches that I read, which is specifically related to...
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:07.600]   It's written for fraud examiners, and it's specifically, "Here's how you do an asset
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:11.040]   investigation, how to do financial asset investigations." You're welcome to read it
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:15.920]   if you want. And so, I went through it and I thought, "Man, this stuff is really good.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:23.040]   So, how do I avoid it?" And what I was amazed at is it all comes down to the...
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:30.400]   If you're a high enough target, it's eventually hard to do, and especially if the person can get
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:34.960]   the courts on their side. But you can still keep money in accounts in the United States,
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:38.400]   and just diversifying into different states, keeping your money in different banks in
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:42.400]   different states, smaller banks in different places, smaller investment firms. You get a
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:46.560]   lot of privacy there, and the privacy laws are enforced and increasingly enforced.
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:51.280]   If you were to go back five years ago, it was very possible for an investigator to...
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:56.880]   Not fish. What's the thing where you basically impersonate someone? To just basically push
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:08:00.800]   against a bank representative and call in real quick to check the transactions and check their
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:05.840]   balances. And there were lower safeguards where impersonation was a very viable technique.
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:09.440]   With most large banks today, it's very hard for me to see how you can do it, right? With
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:15.280]   two-factor authentication, with multiple back and forths, with very strict separation. A lot
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:19.280]   of those techniques have died. And so you've got a lot of privacy in the United States.
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:23.040]   You don't have privacy from the US government, but you do have a significant amount of privacy.
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:31.680]   Now, does going abroad help that? Yes, it can, because the world is a very big place. If you
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:36.480]   have a bank account in the Cayman Islands, unless somebody knows to look in the Cayman Islands,
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:42.320]   are they really going to find your bank account? Not really. But when you actually get into this
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:48.000]   level of investigation, there are a lot of things that can be done where literally you have an
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.040]   investigator that is hired to chase you, who will follow you to the airport and see that you're
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:58.480]   going to the Cayman Islands. There's the old strategies. I read a bunch of old private
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:02.400]   investigator stuff where they talked about how to... You get people to file certain checks and
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:08.720]   you send people all this stuff. And so those are the things that expose you with those offshore
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:15.920]   accounts. So I'm not willing to take the risk of going offshore and not reporting that to the
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:19.760]   government. And so if you say, "Well, if I'm going to do that, then is there a benefit of going
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.920]   offshore?" I apologize that I've gone around in circles. And in summary, yes, I believe that there
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:31.520]   are additional benefits to be gained in going offshore. I believe that if you go offshore,
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:37.600]   you need to make sure that you file every single form properly with the US government to disclose
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:43.600]   that. And I'm not sure about the security of that information. I'm not sure where that goes. I'm not
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:50.000]   sure whether there's about security of that information. And so that's a difficult road
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.160]   to navigate. If you are offshore, I think you do get some additional protection from local
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:02.800]   investigators. But you need to make sure that you actually need it, want it, and are willing to
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:08.400]   incur the costs for it. I'm a fan of it, but it's not easy and it takes some time to set up the
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:14.400]   appropriate infrastructure. And I'm still doing it. I'm still testing all the stuff, trying to
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.880]   work it through so I can give better advice on it from personal experience. I guess it's just
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:24.080]   not the panacea that a lot of people have made it out to be. I think the biggest detriment
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:31.840]   comes down to dealing with the United States. If you could just not deal with the United States,
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:37.680]   all of this stuff is simpler. And so when I look at it, I think that unless you, you know,
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:40.480]   if you're living and working in the United States and that's where you are, of course.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:45.440]   But I think it's a lot of times better off to keep your infrastructure in the United States then.
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:52.960]   If your concern is the United States government, I think the best solution is just follow the legal
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.840]   path, renounce citizenship, and cut off the U.S. government. And then the world is much, much
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:02.960]   freer for you. The last thing I would say is I do think that international diversification,
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:10.000]   going the other way, is actually a very compelling tool. So you can keep your
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:15.600]   infrastructure in the United States, and this is actually one of the things that I recommend for
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:21.120]   non-U.S. citizens especially, you can set up an infrastructure, financial infrastructure,
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:27.760]   in the United States. Once you set that up, because of the very high privacy laws in the
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:34.000]   United States, you can now go elsewhere in the world and through international credit cards,
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.880]   etc., you can have a very high degree of privacy. So if you decided to leave the United States,
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:43.040]   you have all your money in the United States, but you just do something as simple as having
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:48.400]   a U.S.-based credit card, and you go and you move to London, England, but you just always
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:53.360]   swipe your credit card from the United States when you're in London, England, you now have a
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.960]   significantly higher level of privacy than anybody who's based in England has. Because in order for
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.920]   the English government to serve you with some kind of investigation, they have to go to some
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.880]   intergovernmental thing, they have to prove that it's worth it, etc. So internationalization of
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:15.840]   finances is a very compelling strategy for those of us who care about privacy,
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:24.240]   but the laws have changed so drastically in the last decade with the U.S. government of tightening
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:30.000]   up across the board that to me it doesn't seem worth it to try to build privacy from the United
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.160]   States. That's my summary. Okay, thank you. That was really, really helpful. Appreciate it.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:38.880]   My pleasure. Anything else? No, that's it. Thanks.
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:42.080]   Cool. We'll keep it up. David from nowhere, and I enjoyed the question. These things are
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:48.240]   fun to talk about. I don't like to dog on the United States. My goal is not to dog on the
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:52.320]   United States. It's just frustrating to me as a U.S. citizen, currently speaking anyway,
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:59.840]   as a U.S. citizen, being somebody who cares about privacy and being somebody who cares about
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:08.880]   privacy, being somebody who cares about freedom, it's quite humiliating for me to care about
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.120]   freedom, care about the mythology of the United States, now land of the free, home of the brave,
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:19.920]   and all that stuff, and then have to say what I've just said based upon honest analysis,
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:26.960]   right, that you have the largest spy empire in the world and the world's worst. You have
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:32.960]   simultaneously the world's largest, most effective tax haven for everyone who's non-U.S. citizens,
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:40.160]   and you have simultaneously some of the most strict, egregious, privacy-limiting
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:48.480]   actions of any government in the world. That's really humiliating to me. Now, the critic would
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:53.120]   quickly say and would rejoin with simply this, "Well, Joshua, if you're just following all the
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:14:01.360]   laws, then everything's fine, right? Just report everything. Report everything." And to me,
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:06.640]   I find that infuriating, right? I am very, very, very careful to follow every law that I'm possibly
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:13.760]   capable of. I don't intentionally break laws. I follow every law. The problem is that even with
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:20.880]   that, number one, you know where things can go, and yet there's just such a complete and total
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:34.160]   lack of coherence to the theories. Think about the right of privacy, right? This is a very
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:38.960]   contentious topic. Do you have a right of privacy? And in the U.S. Constitution, you have certain
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.440]   rights of privacy, right? Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, rights of privacy. I care about those,
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:48.800]   defend those very, very deeply. You've got the right of privacy that was famously expanded to
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:55.200]   sexual privacy, abortion privacy, things like this. But then you have the Patriot Act. Then
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:00.240]   you have FATCA. Then you have this global empire that basically ignores people's privacy and it
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:06.160]   never gets reined in. And so, even if you follow the laws today, when you recognize how quickly
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:12.080]   things can change, you don't give somebody that kind of power. You don't give it that. And when
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:18.080]   I look forward at the United States, you have an empire that's increasing, you know, fine for right
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:24.400]   now, but an increasingly bankrupt empire. You know, tax and spend crowd all over the place.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:31.280]   It's just a difficult relationship to want to be in. And yet, it's such a deep relationship where
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:36.400]   for most of us, this is your country, this is your home, this is where you live, this is where
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:44.800]   the people that you love are. And I find it really maddening to try to go through it and
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:50.000]   very humiliating to do the analysis as I have done. I guess I just wish for,
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:57.280]   I wish for, I don't know, governments like Singapore, Hong Kong, especially before the
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:03.040]   Chinese, where you have governments that say, "Listen, we honor those who are productive and
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.360]   we want to provide services to you. Instead of, we're going to use our military might,
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:13.200]   we're going to use our spying infrastructure, we're going to use our law enforcement infrastructure
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:19.520]   to build this oppressive place." So, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:25.280]   anti-United States. There are many wonderful things about it. If I had to be stuck in one
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:30.480]   country for the rest of my life, I would still choose the United States. I'm going back to the
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:41.280]   United States next week. And yet, it's just really humiliating to me to try to match the rhetoric,
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:50.720]   the brand up with the reality. And you feel cheated. You feel cheated when you actually do
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:17:00.160]   the analysis. So, your mileage may vary. But I go through significant swings in my own thinking
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:04.320]   where some days I'm like, "Oh, it's not that bad, Josh. You're being an extreme. It's just not that
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:08.560]   bad." And then there are the days where I'm like, "Oh, it's not that bad. I'm just being
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.960]   an extreme. It's just not that bad." And then there are the days where I just say, "I want out.
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:18.240]   I don't want to be a citizen of the United States. What benefit do I get? All I get is this giant
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:23.920]   spy apparatus. I'm always worried about, am I breaking some law that I don't know about in the
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:30.640]   millions of pages of laws? Am I doing something wrong?" I remember just the sense of peace and
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:37.200]   freedom that came when I finally got rid of all of my investment licenses and my insurance licenses.
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:43.200]   And again, you know me, right? I try to be so careful. Even when I was talking earlier about
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:48.160]   liability, I try to be so careful. I try to be scrupulous. I try to be really
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:56.160]   knowledgeable and careful. The problem is this. When you know what you know, you also know what
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:01.920]   you don't know. And so, you always realize where your danger zones could be. And I remember,
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:08.160]   I would always think, "Okay, have I said something? Have I done something? Are my notes good enough?
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:11.760]   I'm going to get audited by the SEC and they're going to come in here and they're going to say
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:18.640]   this thing." And I remember when I got out of and I got rid of them and I could officially come to
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:24.640]   the microphone and just be a person again, instead of a regulated individual. I forget the language
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:29.520]   now. It's been so long. Instead of a... I think it's a regulated person, something like that.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.000]   And I could get free of them. And I look at it and I say, "I do so much better now. I give better
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.200]   advice. I do more good than when the SEC was looking over my shoulder. And I'm worried about
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:49.680]   a FINRA audit." And I feel like the same thing applies with regard to this governmental stuff.
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:56.400]   Problem is, it's a whole lot easier to get rid of a license and to get another one. If I wanted to
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:59.120]   go back and get another license, three months, I could have them all back again. There's no big
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:04.720]   deal. It's not the same way when you're dealing with a country. You're dealing with a citizenship,
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:08.160]   and especially in the United States. Any other country in the world, you can leave.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:15.360]   You can go elsewhere. And for the most part, generally speaking, some exceptions. China's
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:22.640]   changing what they're doing. The last couple of years, major changes. Some of the Five-I countries,
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:32.000]   major, still some changes. But it just seems unfair. It's frustrating. So I share that.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.560]   That's not a very hopeful tone to share that. Well, let me close on a hopeful tone. I hate to
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:43.280]   close a show on an unhopeful tone. I'll say this. For all of my black thinking and all of my
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:48.480]   frustrations and all of that stuff, here's the reality we have to acknowledge. And I think this
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:56.240]   is honest. We have to be honest with the actual facts. You and I today can live more freely than
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:01.840]   almost anybody throughout human history. We have more freedom than almost any time in human history.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:06.960]   Even with all the erosions, even with all the things that are easy to look at and feel bad about,
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:13.920]   as individuals, there are more opportunities for any individual person to just simply make free
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:21.520]   choices. And there are many good reasons for that. But let's focus on those positive sides.
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:26.240]   And let's try to keep a good, firm grasp on reality, not get locked into tunnel vision.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:31.040]   Let's appreciate the benefits of the things that we do have. And let's make decisions that what I
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:38.240]   try to do is always try to keep myself anchored in a firm, big-time grasp of life, not just say,
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:42.240]   "This is the thing that I don't like, and I'm going to leave because of this," but to say,
[02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:47.920]   "Let me look at all the factors." Because we truly do, as individuals, there have never been
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:54.640]   more opportunities. We're living, and I really mean this, we are living in a golden age of
[02:20:54.640 --> 02:21:01.520]   mankind. We're living in a golden age of mankind, and it's just going to get better from here.
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:09.600]   We're living in a time of more prosperity. We're living in a time of more peace. We're living in
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:17.280]   a time of more opportunities, of more freedom, more competition among countries. We're living
[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:23.200]   in a golden age. And I want to be one who focuses on the opportunities and the practical solutions
[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:27.040]   to those things, not one who just sits around and cries. So I hope that's a good, positive way to
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:32.720]   end it up. Happy Friday to you. Looking forward to be back with you next week. A series of shows
