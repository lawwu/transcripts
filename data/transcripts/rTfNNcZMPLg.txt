[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   The following sermon was recorded in Westminster Chapel on Sunday evening, May 12, 1957.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.400]   Dr Lloyd-Jones is continuing his series from Numbers 11, verses 4, 5 and 6.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.880]   Unfortunately, the introductory remarks to this sermon are now missing.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.680]   We now join the doctor as he is reviewing the living conditions of the Jews
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.800]   during their time of exile in Egypt. Here's Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.040]   Not only that, they treated them very cruelly. Taskmasters were appointed over them. They were
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.760]   making bricks. They kept them short with a supply of straw and then punished them because they
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.920]   didn't produce the right and the given number. They were cruelly persecuted. Indeed, they had
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.480]   become slaves. Were utterly helpless and powerless. But God, in his infinite kindness and mercy,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.080]   raised up Moses and sent him, you remember, to the children of Israel and in a most astonishing
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.600]   manner led them out, led them through the Red Sea where their enemies, Pharaoh and his hosts,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.520]   were drowned. And landing on the other side, he led them in the direction of the land of Canaan.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.800]   He had promised he would give them that land, the land flowing with milk and honey. And they
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.720]   might have got into it very quickly, but because of their own sin and folly, they were condemned
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.960]   to traveling in the wilderness for 40 years. And it was in the wilderness they were when this
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.360]   particular incident that we are now concerned about took place. Now that is the background
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.600]   that we must keep obviously in our minds if we are to understand the real significance of this
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.480]   particular incident. Here are these people to whom all that had happened, complaining
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   in the wilderness and saying, "Who will give us flesh to eat?" We remember the fish which we did
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.280]   eat in Egypt freely, the cucumbers, the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.240]   But now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all but this manner before our eyes, this manner
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.560]   which was bred, sent from heaven, God's miraculous way of feeding them. That's how they describe it.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.520]   And they look back with longing to all that they used to eat in Egypt in the time of their
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:42.080]   captivity. Now I'm calling attention to this incident because, as I was indicating last
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.200]   Sunday evening, it really does put in a very clear and pictorial manner, in a manner that I take it
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.880]   we shall never forget because of the character of the incident, what is the essence of the problem
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:06.240]   of men in this world at this very moment. We all know about the problem. We all can see the state
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.760]   of the world. And we're all aware of all of the methods that are being implied in order
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.920]   to attempt to deal with it. I was quoting last Sunday night a great mental expert,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.840]   an authority on mental health in this country, who said the time surely has come when we should
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.080]   set up a research party such as we do for the investigation of cancer and of poliomyelitis
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   to look, he says, into this whole social and moral problem of marriage and divorce in particular.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   It's time, he said, that we began to do this thing scientifically.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:50.080]   Otherwise our civilization is going to be shipwrecked. Now my suggestion is that
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.240]   there is no need to set up a new research department. There is no need to spend thousands,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.720]   perhaps millions of pounds in investigations. The whole trouble with men and the whole trouble
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.440]   with the world tonight is clearly set forth in this Bible already. There's no need to try and
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.560]   discover a diagnosis. The diagnosis is here before us. It's the whole message of the Bible.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:29.040]   The Bible is a book about life. It's a book about men and women like ourselves. It comes to us
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.520]   from God as the explanation of our troubles and problems and difficulties, and with the
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.120]   glorious announcement of the only remedy for such a condition that can possibly work.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   But in particular I am emphasizing this,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:52.320]   that there is no hope whatsoever for this generation or any other generation
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.440]   until we are clear about this diagnosis.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.240]   As long as men think that just a change of government is going to put everything right,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.400]   they are indeed beyond hope. As long as they think that some scientific investigation or
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.680]   the multiplication of certain social services are really going to put the world in order,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.880]   I say as long as they believe a thing like that, they are indeed entirely without hope.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:29.440]   Why? Well for this reason. That those prophet remedies, those penanceas,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.320]   are so utterly and completely superficial in their diagnosis.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:44.400]   They betray the fact that they've never realized the character and the true nature of the problem.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.040]   They think that it's something on the surface so it can be put right easily,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.360]   whereas the problem of men as he is in the world tonight is profound. The trouble with men is a
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:05.200]   radical trouble. And it is because these three verses give us an insight into the radical nature
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.560]   of the problem of men in this world this evening that I'm calling attention to them. Of course,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.840]   the Bible says the same thing everywhere. I'm taking this particular instance, as I say,
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.000]   because it puts it so clearly and it puts it in such an extraordinary pictorial and dramatic manner.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:31.600]   Now then, last Sunday evening I showed you that the Bible says that all men's troubles
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:42.800]   are due to what it calls sin. Everything is due to sin. Sin is that which has entered into us
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:52.080]   and has ruined life and ruined men. Now I'm using my terms advisedly. Sin has ruined men.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:02.800]   It's as terrible as that. And here we are shown of some of the things that sin has done to men.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:11.200]   Now, last Sunday evening I pointed out to you how this incident teaches us very plainly that sin
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.600]   has turned men into a creature of lust and of craving.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:29.200]   Men is a creature as the result of sin who is controlled and governed by desire,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:39.600]   passion, lust, craving. I showed you how it is something that comes and takes hold of the people
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.720]   and of the individual as it took hold of these. The mixed multitude that was among them, there they
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.400]   are going on in their journey, they suddenly fell a lusting. And the children of Israel also
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.880]   wept again and said, "Well, what made this? What made them do this?" There's no explanation at all
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.600]   except this lust that was within them. And that's the whole explanation of life as I try to show.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.600]   That's why there's so much misery and unhappiness. That's why there are so many broken hearts in the
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:20.640]   world tonight. Lust, passion, desire, craving. And I spent my time in pointing out this,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:28.400]   that this principle of lust that is in men, what the New Testament calls the dominion of sin,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:37.760]   is the most powerful thing in all our experiences. It's more powerful than our minds and reasons.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:45.280]   It's more powerful than our wills. Our wills are in bondage. We do things though we know
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   they're wrong. We are driven by this lust, this craving. The conscience speaks, it's silence.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:59.120]   Memory speaks, it's silence. Fear speaks, it is silence. Lust, it comes upon us and it grips us
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.920]   and it over masters us and we are helpless victims in its end. That's life, isn't it?
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:13.440]   These people fell a lusting. And in some shape or form, we are all victims of this.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:23.040]   It isn't always the same form, you see. Don't confine lust to sex. There are lusts of the mind,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:29.920]   according to the Apostle Paul. And what is anger and what is jealousy and envy? What are these
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:37.440]   things but lusts? A desire for greatness or for position or for success or power, it's lust.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:44.240]   It manifests itself in endless ways.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.040]   Ah yes, there was the first thing but you see it isn't the only thing. That isn't all.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.200]   I want to direct your attention this evening to another thing that sin has done to men.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.280]   It follows directly out of the previous one. There's a logical sequence in these things.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.480]   Because men is thus a victim and a creature of lust.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.840]   It means that sin has done something terrible to his mind, to the mind of men.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:29.040]   And I suppose there is nothing more tragic about men than what sin has done to his mind.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:35.600]   Now as I've just reminded you, I was showing last Sunday night that this power of lust is
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.360]   more powerful than a man's reason. But that isn't all we've got to say about that. We must elaborate
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.240]   it because it is something that comes out so clearly in these three verses. Let me show it you.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:59.360]   Mind, after all, is one of God's greatest gifts to men, if not the greatest of all.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:11.040]   Mind is that which differentiates men from the animal. Man has been given this faculty
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.720]   that enables him to look on at himself and to consider himself and to reason about himself
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:25.280]   and about life. This power of objectivity and of consideration and of thought and of analysis.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:34.720]   The mind, oh what a tremendous thing. The mind is, are you surprised to hear a Christian preacher
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.560]   saying something like that? Had you thought that religion and Christianity were but sub stuff?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.160]   My dear friends, it's Christianity alone, as I'm going to show you,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.880]   that rarely appreciates the greatness of the mind of men.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:58.320]   Part of God's image in men is the mind of men.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:05.600]   And of course, we all know, do we not, that man is very proud of his mind.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:17.760]   The modern man especially is proud of his mind, his intellect, his reason, his understanding.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:24.960]   And there is nothing which he pits perhaps so frequently against Christianity and the
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:34.000]   Christian way of life as his mind. The vast majority of people are not in places of worship
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.800]   in this country tonight, and if you were to go to them and to ask them why they're not
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.480]   in some shape or form, the vast majority would tell you that they are not in a place of worship
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:52.320]   because they've got minds, because they've got reason, because they've got understanding.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.160]   It is in terms of the mind and the intellect and the understanding that they reject the gospel.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.240]   And they say that anybody who still believes it is patently showing that he can't think,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.040]   he can't reason, he's burying his head in the sand, he's jettisoned his mind, he's committed
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.800]   intellectual suicide, they say. But they are reasoners and they think and they have minds.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:23.040]   The rationalist press association, the rationalization, the thinking over and against
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.120]   Christianity, which is just emotionalism, which is just sob stuff, as I say, which is just
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:35.920]   a fantasy and being wafted up into a realm of the immaterial where you forget your problems
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:45.440]   and your trouble for the nonce. Now isn't that the position? Man is proud of his mind,
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:54.080]   and he claims that he is not a Christian and not religious and perchance not even a believer in
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   God because of this tremendous faculty that he possesses and which he is employing, the mind.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:13.200]   Now here you see comes the clash, the complete clash with the biblical teaching.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   And it was all summarized in that first verse of the 14th psalm that we read just now. Listen.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:30.800]   "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God." It's the fool who said that.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.720]   God speaks from heaven and says, "Is there no one with understanding? Is there no one who can think
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:48.560]   and reason? Have they all gone mad?" The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. Very well,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.640]   the fundamental proposition of the Bible can be put in this form.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:15:04.080]   That man as the result of sin is no longer governed by his mind. The whole trouble with
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.360]   men in sin is that he's become a fool, that he's governed by anything and everything except his
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.320]   mind. He's lost his understanding. He's lost his way. He can't think, he can't reason. And all I
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.280]   want to try to show you is that that is the solemn truth about everybody who isn't a Christian
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:27.200]   tonight. Christianity anti-intellectual. Christianity is the only true intellectualism.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:33.680]   All else is folly and madness and nonsense. Let me prove it.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:43.600]   Now I want to prove it to you this evening entirely in terms of these three verses and
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.120]   the incident which they record. I could add to it, but I'm deliberately letting this picture speak
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.720]   to us. Now what does it tell us here? What is it that sin has done to the mind of men?
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:04.000]   Well, the first thing that I find here is this, that sin has made the mind of men empty.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.040]   Man has got an empty mind. Where do you find that, says someone? Well, I find it here.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:23.600]   It is because man's mind is empty that things keep on coming into it.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:31.040]   If it were full, there'd be no room for them. You see, here are these children of Israel traveling.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.520]   They've been brought out of Egypt, they're on their way to Canaan. Here they are on the journey.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.360]   Suddenly they began to think. Where did it come from? A thought came.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.880]   Ah, you see, it's because their minds were empty that things like that happened to them.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:53.200]   If these people had got a working philosophy, if they'd understood their own history and experience,
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:00.160]   if these people had but got the doctrine of God that they should have had, that had been taught
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.680]   them by their fathers, they would have had such a complete and entire view of life that this sort
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.440]   of thing, though it might offer itself to them, would be dismissed at once. But you see, their
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:19.920]   minds were vacant. The apostle Paul puts this by talking about the vanity of mind of the Gentiles,
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:30.320]   the vacuity of the Gentiles, the vacant mind. It means, I say, that they have no central
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.280]   understanding of life. They have no real philosophy of life. They have no controlling view of life.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:45.200]   Or let me put it in a phrase that I'm fond of quoting. They do not correspond to Matthew Arnall's
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.000]   definition of a true man. This is it. He sees life steadily and he sees it whole.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.480]   The trouble with men in sin is that he really hasn't got a mind that is filled with a great
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:07.360]   idea, a marvellous concept, a view, an understanding and a philosophy. And the result is because it's
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.680]   empty, things come in from all directions and he's their victim. And he doesn't know what he's going
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.000]   to do next. Suddenly this, suddenly that. Now that's the picture which we are given here.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:29.520]   You see, it is because man's mind is not filled with God and the teaching of the Bible and the
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:37.440]   biblical and godly view of life. It is because of that, I say, that man's mind becomes the prey to
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.320]   any passing thought or any passing idea or any passing desire.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:52.320]   What is it Satan has always plenty of work to give empty hands to do?
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   It's a man who doesn't quite know what to do with himself who's sitting there,
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.400]   who's most likely to fall into temptation.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.720]   He's a man who rarely hasn't got a full mind, you see. So he's sitting in his hotel
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.760]   and he doesn't know what to do with himself. He's read all the papers, what next?
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.720]   He doesn't know, you see. There's nothing central, there's nothing controlling. And so
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.920]   temptation comes and the vacancy is there and it enters in and down he's gone.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:26.160]   Or he's walking about the streets aimlessly. He doesn't know what he wants to do, he doesn't
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.120]   know where he wants to go. He's got no philosophy of life, he's got an empty mind. And suddenly
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:39.680]   the enemy darts in a dart at him and he's gone, he's full. Oh this is a terrible thing.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.880]   But it's the explanation of most of life today, isn't it?
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:52.720]   You see it's because people's minds are so empty that you get what are called fashions of thought.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.040]   Have you noticed them, how they come and how they go?
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.200]   It's all this at one particular time and the other thing is scouted and dismissed.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.720]   But you wait a few years, they'll all be after that and scouting this.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:14.320]   Fashions of thought. You get it in the learned professions, you get it in farming, you get it
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.080]   everywhere. Everybody's doing this at one time, nobody's doing that, then everybody's doing that
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.480]   and nobody's doing this. Fashions of thought. It'd be very interesting, I could keep you at great
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   length, in just giving you a history of the change in the fashions of thought.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:35.760]   Or let me give you perhaps what has been the most striking illustration in this present century.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.520]   Let me take a political illustration.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:48.240]   Do you remember what most people in this country used to think and say, what all the newspapers
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:55.360]   practically said, about a man like Sir Winston Churchill, say from 1930 to 1938?
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:03.440]   Impossible, they said. Nobody can work with him. Difficult men. Always wrong in his judgments,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.480]   always says the wrong thing. Look at his record, look what he did in Antwerp, look what he did in
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.040]   the Dardanelles. Keep him out. And they kept him in the wilderness. A hopeless man, they said.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.520]   They were saying it day after day, in the House of Parliament, in the newspapers, on the street
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:26.080]   corners. He was an impossible man. Then of course, since the war, they've been virtually worshipping
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.880]   him and he can do no wrong. He's now the fount of all wisdom and he never makes a mistake and
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:38.720]   never says anything wrong. That's the sort of thing I'm thinking of. Fashions of thought.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.800]   Yes, you see, men and women today, in spite of education, are exactly like the people who lived
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.920]   in the island of Malta in the time of the Apostle Paul. You remember what happened? He was shipwrecked
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.800]   and he landed on the island. And then the moment he had landed, as they lit a fire out of some
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:00.400]   sticks, and a serpent came out and bit the Apostle Paul. Ah, they said, this man must be a great
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.960]   sinner. He's been bitten by a serpent and he's going to die. And they were expecting him to drop
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.400]   dead at any moment. They said, he's a vile person, he's got a devil. But then miraculously, you see,
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.960]   the Apostle was healed the next moment they were worshipping him as a god. Read the account in
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:23.280]   Acts chapter 28. That's the sort of quick change in fashion. And it's all due to the empty mind.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.960]   It means that people, you see, haven't got a real judgment. They haven't got a whole view. So they're
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.800]   the victims of any stray thought that may come along. Anything may prey upon them and enter
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   into them. Fashions of thought, rapid changes, and of course, crazes. What everybody's doing,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.840]   we must all do. And the result of all this, not for me to keep you with this particular point,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:23:01.280]   is this. It is because the mind of men today is so much in sin, that the modern man is such an
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:09.040]   obvious and a tragic victim of propaganda. If you, I'll use the term, if you go plugging a thing at
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.920]   him, he'll eventually believe it. Why? Well, he's got no resistance, you see. He hasn't got a belief,
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.280]   he hasn't got a philosophy. His mind is empty. So if you go on pushing the same thing in, it'll lodge
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.560]   there. And keep on doing it, and don't let anybody else get in, and yours will stay there. Propaganda.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.360]   And men can be manipulated. Hitler knew that, and there are others who still know it.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:37.600]   This, I say, is one of the major explanations of the state of the world today. It's the whole
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:44.080]   explanation of the history of this 20th century. Man has turned his back upon God, and when you
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:50.880]   turn your back upon God, and God goes out of your life, your mind becomes empty. It's vacant. You
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:24:01.120]   drive out the devil, and the seven others come in. And it was because of their vacant mind,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:10.720]   that the children of Israel at this point became victims of this lust, and put forward this request.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:19.440]   But let me go on to the second point in the analysis. Sin not only makes our minds empty,
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:30.800]   it also makes them uncritical. Sin takes from men the power of criticism.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   Ah, criticism is a wonderful thing. Now when I say criticism, I'm using it in its technical sense.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:45.520]   There's nothing more interesting than to have a good and an intelligent criticism
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.600]   of a book, or a piece of music, or a performance of a piece of music, a critique.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:59.120]   The power of discrimination and the ability to criticize is a very rare gift indeed,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:07.440]   but it's a very precious one. And you know that it's one of the things that is destroyed by sin
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:15.680]   always. Sin first of all blunts, and then finally destroys a man's critical faculty.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:23.520]   It renders him incapable of testing ideas and sifting them. You see, it puts him into the
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:32.000]   position of these children of Israel, that the moment a thought comes, he accepts it uncritically,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.000]   and carries it out. He doesn't stop to think, he doesn't work it out, he doesn't take the
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.400]   trouble to work it right through, he doesn't even consider possible consequences. No, no,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.320]   he only has one thing at a time, and he lives for the present, and he really doesn't take an idea
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:58.080]   that offers itself and subject it to a profound analysis and criticism in order to see what it
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:07.840]   really is. Now isn't that very obvious about these children of Israel? Here they are, you see,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.160]   and the journey and the idea comes, and at once they begin shouting, and they begin weeping and
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:18.960]   crying. Why didn't they stop and think? Why didn't they begin to reason? Why didn't they say, "Now
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.280]   what if we do this? What are the consequences? Why should we want this? What was the position?
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.640]   What's the position like?" No, no, they don't ask any such questions.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:35.760]   The idea came, and they accepted it, it stimulated the lust,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.440]   and they began to plead for the fish and the food.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:48.160]   Now in the New Testament you get this selfsame thing put like this.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.520]   We are told of Moses, the very man that was leading these children of Israel,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:09.360]   that he chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:19.280]   for a season. Why? Well, the explanation goes on and tells us it was that he had his eye
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.960]   on the recompense of the reward. You see, the choice was there before Moses. He might have
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:33.840]   continued as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. There were great prospects in the court and in other
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:43.440]   respects. But we are told that Moses elected and chose rather to suffer affliction with this handful
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:50.560]   of people, and it was because he thought and reasoned and criticized and analyzed.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   Now, my friends, let's transfer this to the modern age and to the modern men.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:05.600]   The vast majority of people in this country today are rejecting this gospel.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:12.240]   They are deliberately choosing that worldly kind of life. They live and they glory in it,
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.360]   and they say it's marvelous and wonderful. And they're a great crowd and they're all shouting
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.960]   together, and they all would have us believe that they're very happy, and they're all doing it. Why?
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.240]   Well, I say it's still the same. It's a lack of criticism.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:33.600]   It is the lack of thought. It is the lack of reason.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:41.440]   What is it that they're failing to ask? Well, they're just failing to ask certain obvious
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.200]   questions, and here are some of them.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:51.760]   What is the real value of this life that we are living, actually, even in the present?
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:29:00.320]   Is it ennobling? Is it uplifting? Is it enriching to the mind and the intellect and the heart?
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.800]   Is it of any real benefit to mankind? Where does it lead me?
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.920]   How will it help me if I'm suddenly taken ill, if I suddenly lose my health or lose my job?
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.640]   How will it help me if I suddenly lose a loved one by death?
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:25.200]   What will be my own position
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:31.680]   at the end of such a life and when I myself come to die?
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.520]   What will be my position beyond death? What is there then?
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.400]   "Ah," says the modern man uncritically, "those are morbid questions."
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:50.240]   And especially, perhaps, those who are young are tempted to say that
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.840]   you don't think that such questions appeal to me and are relevant to my position.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.840]   Well, my friend, I've got a most terrible answer to give you to that statement, and it's this.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.440]   [Pause]
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.000]   I went into my vestry at the close of the morning service this morning,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.520]   and I was told these two things. Now, I'm saying this as just facts.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.360]   [Pause]
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.480]   First of all, I was told that a schoolboy,
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:29.120]   who had been brought to one of our services here but a few weeks ago,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:38.080]   suddenly in the gymnasium of his school this last week, dropped down dead.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.640]   A schoolboy. I don't know the cause of death, but it's happened.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:53.600]   Here's a boy in school, as you would imagine and reason, with the whole of his life before him.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.720]   How little did he think a few weeks ago when he sat here
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.920]   that in a few weeks he'd have gone out of the world.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.680]   But he's gone.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.200]   [Pause]
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.720]   And then I had a father and a mother who came in to see me,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:20.000]   to tell me that their darling boy, aged 18, had got a cancerous growth in his arm,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.360]   and that the most the doctors could offer at the height of their optimism was 12 months.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.560]   [Pause]
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:35.040]   I hope you'll all who are Christians pray for that boy and for that father and mother.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.320]   Pray God for a miracle.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:45.840]   Pray that they may be given grace to submit to the will of God and to God's way,
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.200]   and to believe that it's always good whatever may happen.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.320]   But I'm quoting the incident to you just to tell you
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.200]   that if you think you can argue in terms of age or health or anything else,
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.680]   I've only one thing to say to you, and I say it very plainly and bluntly,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.560]   you're a fool.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.080]   You're just a simple fool.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.960]   [Pause]
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.800]   And it's the only language to use.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:19.920]   Our whole life in this world is uncertain.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.680]   Nothing is more uncertain.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.320]   We can guarantee nothing.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.120]   We don't know whether we'll be alive tomorrow.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:33.600]   We are all together in the hands of God, and death must come, and God and judgment.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.720]   Have you considered these things?
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.800]   Where's your critical faculty?
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.520]   When that thought comes, turn your back on the Church.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.080]   Turn your back on Christ and Christianity.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.600]   Plunge into pleasure.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.960]   Live the worldly life.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.160]   Have you examined it?
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.120]   Where is it going to land you?
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.400]   [Pause]
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.440]   Don't be a fool.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:33:02.400]   A man who doesn't reason and ask questions and think and consider and estimate
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.520]   is a man who has an uncritical mind.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.880]   I say again, he is a fool.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.840]   But let me hasten on.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:24.080]   The next thing I want to observe is this, that sin makes our minds prejudiced and dishonest.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.040]   Now let me prove this to you.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:33.120]   We hear a great deal today about free thought.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.120]   Well, if there is one thing about which we can absolutely be certain, it is this.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.440]   There is no such thing as free thought.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.000]   We are, every one of us, the creatures of prejudice.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.080]   Our minds are made up before we listen to the evidence,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.120]   and we never really consider all the evidence.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.080]   We decide on our verdict before we have listened to counsel.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.560]   Prejudice.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.000]   Now let me show it to you in this particular instance.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.560]   Have you ever seen a more glaring case of it?
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   Here are these people on their journey on the way to Canaan.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.640]   The thought comes about the fish, and then they look back into Egypt and they say,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:20.400]   "Ah, we remember the fish that we used to eat in the land of Egypt so freely,
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.960]   the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic."
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   What are they doing?
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.280]   Well, they're looking back at their life in Egypt.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.000]   And what's the conclusion they come to?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.720]   They come to the conclusion that it was a marvelous life.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.440]   They wish they were back there,
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.480]   eating the fish and the garlic and the leeks and the onions and the melons.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.240]   And this manner, this wretched, constant manner.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.840]   Here they are, they're looking at a position, and they arrive at a judgment.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.320]   And I say there's nothing here but prejudice.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.760]   How do I prove it like this?
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.000]   They look back at their life in Egypt, and what do they emphasize?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.800]   They emphasize one part of the story, and they deliberately suppress the other.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.480]   You see, looking back, this is what they say, "Oh, you know that life in Egypt.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.240]   You remember the fish.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:20.000]   You remember the leeks and the garlic and the melons and the onions.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.840]   But what about the floggings?
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.360]   What about the whip?
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.920]   Not a word about the whipping.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.680]   Not a word about the flogging.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.200]   There was nothing there but food, luxury, plenty, marvelous meals.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:41.440]   They don't say a single word about the suffering, about making bricks without straw,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.360]   and all the agony and all the suffering through which they went.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.560]   Now, my friends, I say there's only one thing to say about that.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.240]   That is sheer dishonesty.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.520]   That's manipulating the facts.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.760]   That is suppressing the unpleasant, over-emphasizing the pleasant.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.240]   It isn't really thinking straightly.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.920]   It is sheer dishonesty.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:08.320]   [Pause]
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.920]   How modern these people are.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:17.200]   You know it is because people still do the same that they think they can dismiss
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.720]   Christianity with a wave of the hand.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.520]   "Christianity," they say.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   "Christianity."
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.760]   There was a man living next door to me.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.120]   He was a great Christian, always going to his place of worship,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.080]   and he did the dirtiest trick I've ever seen in my life.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.840]   So much for your Christianity.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.920]   [Pause]
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.440]   Doesn't say a word about the great record of the Christian church.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.120]   [Pause]
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.360]   Doesn't say a word about the Son of God who left the courts of heaven
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.080]   and came and was born as a babe in Bethlehem.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.160]   [Pause]
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.000]   Doesn't say a word about His sweating blood in the garden
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.840]   and dying on the cross for those who were His enemies.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.040]   [Pause]
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.520]   Not a word about all the saints and all the benefactors
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.960]   that this world has known in the life of the Christian church.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.240]   Not a word.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.560]   One man, one bit of evidence, and all the rest suppressed.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.160]   [Pause]
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.840]   That's not reason.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.440]   That's not thinking.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.360]   That's prejudice and abuse.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   That's sheer dishonesty.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.680]   My friend, have you rejected Christianity?
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.040]   Well, let me ask you a few straight questions.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.720]   Have you ever read the Bible right through?
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.560]   Have you?
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.720]   Have you even read the New Testament right through?
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.000]   Do you know what Christianity really is?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.640]   How many books have you read on it?
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.800]   How much trouble have you taken to investigate its story and its claims
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.360]   and its amazing history?
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.000]   Come, have you really faced all the facts?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.520]   Have you really said, "Very well, I've heard the case for the prosecution.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.840]   We'll counsel for the defense. Now speak."
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.440]   Have you looked at both sides?
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.040]   Have you been honest?
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.400]   Have you had all the facts before you?
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.520]   Or have you just taken one side that you happen to agree with
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.800]   and that pleases you?
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.920]   And have you deliberately suppressed all the other
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.760]   and dismissed it in your prejudice?
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.720]   Now, what are the facts?
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.520]   Well, I've only to ask my question.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.000]   For us all to know perfectly well what the facts are,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.600]   man's mind as the result of sin has become dishonest.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.560]   It's hopelessly prejudiced.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.240]   It's almost incredible that these people should do a thing like this, isn't it?
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.160]   But they did it.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.640]   Not a word about the unpleasant.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   Only that which was pleasant.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.120]   And so it is still.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.800]   Poor, modern, sinful man.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.080]   He's blinded by the God of this world,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.960]   lest he believe the gospel of Christ.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.920]   He's so blinded by his prejudice and his ignorance
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.160]   that he doesn't know what it is.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.520]   It is the fool that says in his heart,
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.800]   "There is no God."
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.440]   And let me come to my last point, which is this.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:37.200]   Sin debases the mind of man and debases his judgment.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:37.920]   What do I mean?
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.120]   I mean this.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:46.400]   Man, as the result of the effect of sin upon his mind,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:52.160]   seems to be incapable of grasping principles.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.360]   He simply is interested in feelings and sensations
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.680]   and pleasure and joy.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.240]   Now, let me illustrate it in the case of these people.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.520]   I put it to you that this is one of the most amazing things
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.800]   that the children of Israel ever did.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.760]   What I can't get over is this,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.480]   that it was ever possible for the children of Israel
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.760]   to speak of Egypt like this.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.800]   Listen to them.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.280]   "We remember the fish that we did eat in Egypt freely,
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.440]   the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.640]   and the garlic.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.760]   That's how they speak of Egypt."
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.600]   I say it's almost incredible that they could ever have done that.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.560]   What does it indicate?
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.280]   It indicates this.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.880]   It indicates to me quite clearly that the only thing
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.960]   that really troubled them and worried them
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:03.600]   when they were in Egypt was not their state and condition,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   but only their suffering.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.480]   They don't seem to have realized that the most terrible thing
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.520]   about their position when they were in Egypt
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.920]   was not simply that they were maltreated,
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.360]   not simply that they suffered pains on their poor backs
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.120]   when they were lashed with whips,
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:28.960]   but that they were slaves, that they were serfs,
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.920]   that they'd lost their liberty.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.840]   They never seem to have realized that,
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   because looking back, you see,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:42.080]   all they think about is these pleasures that they enjoyed.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.640]   They never thought that's the principle.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.920]   And equally clearly, I can put it like this.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.840]   Isn't it equally patent about them
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.360]   that here now in this wilderness,
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.880]   they don't really value their freedom.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.120]   They don't say a word about freedom.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.480]   All they're interested in is food.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.120]   You see, it doesn't seem to enter into their minds
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.080]   that over and above what you eat and what you enjoy
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.000]   are certain great positions,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.720]   that a man may be a slave or that he may be a free man.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.160]   But freedom and slavery don't seem to count with these people.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.000]   They're only interested in sensations and feelings
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.520]   and enjoyment and in luxury.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.640]   So they're in this terrible position
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.280]   that they put fish before freedom,
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.760]   that they put leeks before liberty.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.640]   My heart breaks as I think of them.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   Here are men who'd been slaves.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.360]   They've been brought out by the mighty action of God.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.720]   They're free men, free men in a wilderness,
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.320]   but that means nothing to them.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.600]   "Ah," they say, "where are the leeks and the melons
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.440]   and the fish and the garlic?"
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.920]   What a terrible thing sin is.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.320]   It makes a man more interested in his enjoyments and pleasures
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:18.560]   than in his state and in his condition.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.280]   Now I believe that it is this that accounts
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.440]   for most of our troubles in this country today.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.000]   With all the dread possibilities in this modern world,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.840]   I read an article by a man the other day
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.520]   and I agree with what he said.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.440]   He said, "Though the world is as it is,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.840]   the vast majority of people are not interested,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.920]   as long as they can look at their television
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.000]   and have their smokes and their drinks
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.080]   and go on getting money for nothing.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.120]   They care nothing about it."
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.480]   What's it mean?
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:58.160]   Interested in fish and leeks and garlic and melons
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.680]   rather than in the state and the condition of men
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.440]   and the whole future of the human race.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.720]   And indeed, as I was suggesting a few months ago,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.360]   isn't this the very essence even of our industrial
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.280]   and economic position today?
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:21.200]   Everybody's interested in fish and leeks and garlic and melons
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.600]   and let the country go where it will.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.440]   All I'm interested in is my pay packet or my bank balance
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:34.960]   and my enjoyment, these things that I want to enjoy.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:41.920]   The whole future of the country seems to be irrelevant
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:47.120]   as long as we can continue with our present pleasures
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.360]   and enjoyment.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.320]   Oh, what a tragic thing sin is.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.720]   It has so warped these men's minds
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.360]   and it's so ruined them that they can look back at Egypt
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.320]   and praise it.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:04.480]   I say, sooner be a free man on a starvation diet
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.880]   than to have all the fish of the universe
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.840]   and melons and leeks and garlic and onions
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.120]   in slavery and serfdom.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.360]   But sin, you see, has destroyed the noblest thing
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.200]   that is in men.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.880]   It has destroyed his own conception of himself,
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.600]   of his dignity, of his manhood, of his greatness as made
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.280]   in the image of God.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.040]   He's become a creature who simply wants his desires
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.440]   and passions and lusts satisfied.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.120]   And he's lost this fact that he's an upright man
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.640]   and meant for liberty and meant for knowledge of God.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:53.840]   He can forget slavery as long as his animal desires
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.160]   are gratified.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.960]   Oh, my dear friends, I'm calling your attention
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.280]   to this incident, as I say, because I would have you see
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.440]   that sin is that which destroys the very thing
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.640]   that makes man, man.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.240]   It's insulting to human nature.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.080]   It's insulting to men.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.640]   Man is not a creature who is to be satisfied
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.840]   with things like this.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.000]   What these people should have said is this,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.120]   "It's true that our diet is rather monotonous.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.440]   It's always manner day after day.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   But thank God we are free.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.640]   We are at liberty.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.080]   We are men again.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.680]   We are our own masters.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.080]   And Pharaoh and his hosts are destroyed.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.800]   Let them keep their leeks and garlic and onions.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.160]   We'll never barter our liberty for such things."
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:52.000]   And if you are not a Christian tonight,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:59.200]   you are just a slave of the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.880]   And the more you boast to me about the marvelous time
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.680]   you're having, the more I see your slavery.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:13.600]   Because you don't realize that you're the victim
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.000]   of these things and are held in their grip.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.600]   Try and break free and you'll find how much a slave you are.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.400]   What about your soul?
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:28.000]   What about your human dignity and greatness?
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.680]   What about your knowledge of God?
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:38.880]   A man who can boast about the kind of life that is being
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.520]   lived by the average non-Christian today
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:47.040]   is simply proclaiming that he can't think,
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:54.400]   that he has lost his critical faculty, that he is prejudiced,
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:05.440]   that his judgment is debased, that he doesn't even know what a man is.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.960]   Leave alone God.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:12.000]   Oh, my dear friend, have you seen it?
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.520]   Have you seen yourself in the grip of this fell disease,
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:24.160]   this foul canker, this mastery, this dominion of sin and Satan?
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.080]   If you have, you will realize that your first need
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:39.840]   is the need to have your mind renewed, set at liberty,
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:46.240]   rendered capable of thought and analysis and understanding.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.360]   And you can't do that for yourself.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.880]   And the world can't, and the philosophers can't,
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:57.360]   because they're bound themselves and blinded and prejudiced.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:03.360]   No one can do it for you but one, the Son of God.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:10.320]   He came from heaven to earth to set the captives free,
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:16.240]   to give sight to the blind, understanding to the fool.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.840]   And he can set you free.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:28.960]   He can give you a new nature, a new mind, a new understanding, a new outlook.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:35.280]   And when you've got it, you'll hate that old life, whatever it may have given you.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:41.760]   You'll see that it's empty and dying, and you'll see that you were a slave.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:47.120]   And you'll thank him, the Son of God, who said,
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   "If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed."
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:01.120]   Have you seen the slavery? Have you seen what sin has done to you?
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.000]   Well, if you have, go to God without any delay.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.320]   Acknowledge it and confess it. Give in.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.280]   Acknowledge your ignorance, your arrogance especially.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:19.120]   Cast yourself at his mercy and at his feet, and ask him to open your eyes by the Holy Spirit,
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:29.120]   to see this Son of God, Jesus, who came to bear your sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.000]   and who's taken your sins away, and who'll reconcile you to God,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.360]   and give you this new life and outlook and understanding and energy and power,
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:47.040]   and enable you to enjoy the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:53.360]   And continue in your march towards that heavenly Canaan,
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:51:01.760]   where you shall feast with Christ to all eternity. Amen.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:07.040]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
