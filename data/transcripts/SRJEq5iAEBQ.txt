[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   Sarah writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, what does it mean to take captive every thought
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.920]   to make it obedient to Christ?"
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.000]   2 Corinthians 10.5.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.680]   How can I take this commandment and apply it to my incorrect or sinful thoughts that
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.480]   I may obey Christ and have joy in Him?
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.720]   Well, here's the text.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.240]   Let's read it, and then we'll see if we can figure this out.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.760]   2 Corinthians 10, and two verses, 4 and 5.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.480]   "For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh."
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.160]   That is, they're not merely human.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.160]   This is not a mere battle between one philosopher with some human wisdom against another philosopher
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.640]   with the human wisdom.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:53.420]   "But the weapons of our warfare have divine power to destroy strongholds."
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.720]   And then he defines this powerful stronghold-destroying activity in two steps.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:11.560]   Verse 5, "First, we destroy arguments and every lofty or proud opinion raised against
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.840]   the knowledge of God.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.360]   And second, we then take every thought captive."
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.760]   So, like, you move in a battle and you destroy the fortress, and then you take captives.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.620]   We take every thought captive to obey Christ.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:36.360]   So Sarah asks, how can she take verse 5, "taking every thought captive," and apply it to herself
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.140]   to be more obedient to Christ in her thought life?
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.220]   The first thing, I think, that needs to be said, that when we apply this to ourselves,
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.220]   we have to make sure we're in the right place in the text.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.460]   When Paul says, first, he's destroying arguments and arrogant opinions against God, and second,
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.420]   that he is taking thoughts or minds captive, we need to realize it's the minds and thoughts
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420]   of others.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.620]   He's not talking about taking his own thoughts captive.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.100]   It's the thoughts of others.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.380]   I'm moving into these rascals in Corinth who are so boastful in their philosophical prowess
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.100]   that I am going to demolish them, not by counter philosophy, but by divine power.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.340]   I'm going to show power, and they're going to collapse in their thinking, and then I'm
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.660]   going to take their thoughts captive so that they now obey Christ.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.180]   So he's the warrior, and the enemy is these people whose minds and arguments are proud
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.860]   and lifted up against God, and when Paul defeats those minds and arguments in the power of
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.380]   the Holy Spirit, their thoughts and their minds are taken captive, and they become people
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.140]   with the mind of Christ or obedient to Christ.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.820]   So I think Sarah might be misreading just slightly.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.220]   I'm going to come around and say she's on the right track, but she might be misreading
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.300]   the verse when she says, "How can I take this command and apply it to my incorrect,
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.100]   sinful thoughts?"
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.180]   It's not a command.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.580]   It's a statement about what Paul is doing to his opponents.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.620]   He's demolishing their worldview and then taking their defeated thoughts captive for
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.340]   Christ so that they become thinkers rightly.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.540]   They're obedient in the way they think about Christ.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.420]   So verse 5 is not a command to do this ourselves, but Sarah's question is still a very good
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.420]   question.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.460]   There is a way to apply this to ourselves.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.500]   We just have to get ourselves in the right place, and the place we belong in is the group
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.140]   whose opinions and thoughts Paul is trying to demolish.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.620]   That's where we belong.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.660]   We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and we
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.620]   take every thought captive.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.900]   So when John Piper reads that, or when Sarah reads it, I should say, or she should say,
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.180]   "Okay, Paul, here I am.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.920]   Do your demolishing work on me.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.260]   Do your captive-taking work on me.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.000]   Destroy in my mind any false or proud thoughts that I have about God," which means really
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.740]   two things, I think, that Sarah and I, and anybody else, any Christian, should do.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.940]   One, we should listen to Paul and submit all our thoughts and ideas and feelings about
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.340]   God and about life, submit them to Paul's teaching, God's apostle for scrutiny, and
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.100]   if anything is out of sync with Paul's teaching, we should let it be destroyed.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.380]   I have experienced this very painfully.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:05.180]   I mean, if you put your mind and thoughts really at the disposal of the apostolic teaching
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.260]   and say, "Anything in my thinking that needs to be destroyed, destroy it," it can utterly
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.260]   undo you.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.940]   There have been seasons in my life where I have wept over the dismantling of what felt
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.780]   like really important structures in my brain.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.820]   So I think that's the first thing we do.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.020]   We listen to Paul, we submit everything we think, all of our ideas, all our worldview,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.100]   all our viewpoints to God, and we say, "Paul, let your word dismantle me if necessary."
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.700]   The second thing we should do is we should ask the Holy Spirit to work, because Paul
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:55.540]   said we don't fight with mere human fleshly arguments.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.140]   Our ministry has power, so we should expose ourselves to that power.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.420]   Verse 4 says, "The weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but have divine power."
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.140]   In other words, he's tearing down arguments and God-belittling ideas, but he's not doing
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.900]   it merely by argument.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.820]   So when I come to the Bible, there's a lot of study I do, and I love to study, and I
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.700]   love to assess arguments and figure them out, but I should also be crying out, "Oh God,
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:36.020]   I know that mere intellect will not dismantle the deeply rooted errors of my mind, so I
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:43.340]   avail myself, I open myself to the Holy Spirit, and I seek your face."
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.940]   Paul said in Romans 15, 18, "For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.380]   has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience."
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.060]   Now I think that's the same obedience as in 2 Corinthians 10, 4, and 5, when he brings
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.340]   our thoughts into obedience to Christ.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.540]   And here he says, "I won't speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished."
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:15.780]   So that's what I'm getting at when I say expose yourself, lay yourself open to the risen Christ
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.900]   by the power of the Holy Spirit through the words of the Apostle Paul, so that everything
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.860]   can be dismantled, and then your brain, your mind, your thoughts can be taken captive and
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.540]   everything brought into conformity to Christ.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.540]   Excellent.
