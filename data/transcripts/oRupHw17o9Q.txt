[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.160]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the fifth chapter, reading again from verse 29
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.160]   to the end of verse 32. I want in particular to deal with that very last statement in the
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.360]   thirty-second verse, "And so is the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:35.160]   him." We are dealing here, as many, most perhaps present will recall, with the answer
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.920]   that was given by the apostles, speaking particularly through the mouth of the apostle Peter, to
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.880]   the great court at Jerusalem, the Sanhedrin, which had put these men once more on trial
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.200]   and were again prohibiting them to preach the gospel. Those who meet here regularly
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.400]   will know how we have been considering this statement, this passage, for several Sunday
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.440]   evenings. And it is a most vital and important matter for us to pay attention to, were it
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.320]   merely for this reason, that here is the early church. This is the church as she came into
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   being at the beginning. Alas, there is great confusion today as to what the Christian church
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.020]   is. Still more as to what her message is, as to what her business is in this world.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.120]   If we really want to know, I suggest that in honesty you do not start with a modern
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.040]   book, you start with this. It is not what men think the church ought to be that matters.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.480]   The question is, what is it? How did it begin? How did it come into being? How did it function
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.280]   at the beginning? Surely, common honesty demands and insists that we should bring all our ideas
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.720]   and theorising to the bar of this authentic and only account which we have of the origin
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.360]   of the Christian church. And that is what we have been trying to do together.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.560]   But here you see, the matter is put before us in this very interesting form. The apostles
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.880]   are in trouble and have been arrested because of their preaching and because of the miracles,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.680]   the kind miracles and deeds which they have worked. The peculiar special cause of their
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.880]   being in trouble was that Peter and John were going up to the temple one afternoon to pray.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.560]   But on their way into the temple, they were going in through the beautiful gate. There
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.680]   were several gates leading to the temple. They were going in through the beautiful gate
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.480]   and there they were accosted by a poor fellow sitting on the pavement. He was a poor man
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.680]   over forty years of age who had been born lame. He had never walked in his life and
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.080]   he was just a common beggar. Nobody could help him. The science of those days could
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.720]   not cure him. And there he was sitting on the pavement having been put there, deposited
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.400]   there, and he just begged of people as they went into the temple. And he saw these two
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.000]   men coming. They looked perfectly ordinary men and he asked alms of them. But he did
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.400]   not receive any. The reason for that was they had not got any. They happened to be two apostles.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.280]   They fastened their eyes upon him and looked at him and said in the words again of Peter,
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.840]   "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.600]   of Nazareth. Rise up and walk." Peter extended his right hand to him and took hold of his
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.320]   right hand. The man immediately sprang onto his feet. His feet and ankle bones at once
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.120]   received strength. And in a few moments you see him walking and leaping and praising God
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.560]   and going into the temple with the apostles. And of course this created a great sensation.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.440]   People came crowding together from everywhere to know what all this was about. And Peter
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   preached to them and explained to them that this was something that had been done not
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.320]   by them, Peter and John, but by that Jesus whom they had slain and hanged on a tree.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.480]   That he'd risen and was still active and operated and still doing the kind of thing that he
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.720]   had done when he was here in the days of his flesh. Well now this was the cause of the
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.840]   whole trouble. The authorities arrest them, put them on trial. There's no charge to bring
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.080]   against them, so they set them free and say, "Now we let you go on condition that you stop
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.520]   preaching and teaching or doing anything in the name of this Jesus." But the apostles
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   didn't listen to them. They went on preaching more than ever. And the result was that people
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.280]   came crowding everywhere as you saw. They brought their people in from all the surrounding
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.720]   countries, multitudes out of the cities, round about Jerusalem came, bringing the sick folks,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.200]   etc. The apostles have become the center of great interest and everybody is listening
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.840]   to them rather than to these great Jewish teachers, the Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.240]   and doctors of the law. And they're of course infuriated by this. Their jealousy is aroused
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.120]   and they arrest the apostles once more and throw them into the common prison. But as
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   you remember the story tells us, they were liberated, set free in a miraculous manner
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.240]   and are back again preaching in the temple. So once more they send their officers for
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.040]   them and here they're standing again before the Sanhedrin and this is the charge. "Did
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.120]   we not straightly charge you and commend you that you should not teach in this name? And
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.320]   behold you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:01.120]   upon us." Now that's the position. They're told to stop preaching. That it's wrong, it's
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.840]   foolish, it's blasphemous, they mustn't do it. And here we are considering the reply
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.560]   of the apostles to that. Now why are we doing this? Well I say again we're doing it for
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.000]   one reason only. We are living in a world in which many people are saying in various
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.040]   ways the very thing that the Sanhedrin said to the apostles. We are told that Christianity
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.160]   is an anachronism in the modern world, that it's ridiculous, foolish. The idea that anybody
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   should believe this kind of thing, the clever people of the Sunday papers, that's what they
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.480]   keep on saying in different ways isn't it? They're amazed that anybody should still believe
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.600]   this sort of thing. In other words they're saying stop it. It's out of date, it's finished,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.880]   foolish. It's even insulting to the modern man in the mid-twentieth century with all
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.160]   his scientific learning and knowledge. They're trying to stop it in various ways. Ridicule
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.920]   now, not always throwing us into prisons but trying to silence us by ridicule and contempt.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.680]   It's the same spirit, the same thing. And here my friends we've got the same answer,
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.400]   it's the only answer. Why we ignore everything they've got to say and we go on preaching
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:21.240]   this old old gospel which is ever new and ever true. What are the reasons? Why must
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.440]   we go on with this? Well we've already considered them. Until we come to this one we're considering
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.720]   tonight the argument in essence of these aren't we? We preach this because it is God's plan
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:45.280]   of redemption. We are to hearken and to listen unto God rather than unto men. The preaching
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:53.000]   of the apostles was not an expression of their ideas or their thoughts. That which claims
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.920]   to be gospel which is nothing but the ideas and theories and suppositions of men, there's
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:05.840]   only one thing to say about it, it is a lie. The gospel is God's. The God of our fathers
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:13.240]   raised up Jesus. It isn't what a man thinks with his modern knowledge and ideas. No no.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   It's this old message, God, not men and anything that purports or claims to be gospel which
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.840]   has nothing but a human authority behind it is a denial of the New Testament message.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.680]   Doesn't matter who preaches it, whatever his position may be in the church, it is a
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:38.800]   lie. It is God's and not men's. And then you see the second argument is the nature
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:46.840]   of this gospel. What is it? Well the God of our fathers has raised up Jesus and made him
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:55.520]   a prince and a savior. The message about the Son of God, the only begotten Son of God,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:03.120]   the great message of the incarnation, the miraculous attestation of his deity, his death
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   upon the cross and its meaning, the glorious resurrection. Here it is, the person of Christ.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.680]   He does the saving. He doesn't teach us how to save ourselves. He saves us. He's the
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   prince, the governor of the universe. He is the savior of mankind. It is he who saves,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.840]   not us. That's the nature of the message. And then of course the character of what it
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:39.160]   gives us, the salvation, repentance, a realization of why we are as we are, opening our eyes
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.640]   to the truth about ourselves and to our condition at the moment and our eternal condition,
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:52.280]   repentance. Nothing else can give us this. We may have remorse. We may feel sorry for
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   what we've done at times. We may suffer as the result of our folly. But men can never
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:05.600]   voluntarily repent. This is produced only by this Jesus. He's the prince and the savior
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:14.680]   for to give repentance to Israel and remission or forgiveness of sins. It's a glorious message
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.960]   that assures a man that if he believes in this Jesus, his sins are forgiven and blotted
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.120]   out. He's reconciled to God. He becomes a child of God as a new nature and can look
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:33.000]   forward to an everlasting hope of glory without end. That's the message. And that is, says
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.560]   Peter, the reason why we can't listen to you. With all due respect to St. Hedren's, to great
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.920]   courts, to human wisdom and authority, this is our answer. We ought to obey God rather
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.960]   than men. This message that we have is God's. It's the only hope for the world. We can't
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:58.440]   keep silent. The destiny of men and women in time and in eternity depends upon what
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.440]   they do with this message. We must. And so they defy the authorities and are ready if
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.480]   necessary even to face death rather than to cease to proclaim this glorious and wonderful
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.720]   gospel. But now, the question still asked is this, you see, how can we be sure of these
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:27.280]   things? That's the question the modern man puts on what authority, how do we know? It's
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.680]   all right, that sounds very wonderful. But how can we be sure that these things that
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.280]   you are saying are right? Well now, the apostle, you see, at the end of his statement answers
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:45.280]   the question, he says, we are witnesses of these things. And so is also the Holy Ghost
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.880]   whom God hath given to them that obey him. What does it mean? Well, we've already considered
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:59.120]   the witness of the apostles. They bore their witness to the person of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:07.520]   They'd been with him. They'd heard his every word of teaching. They'd beheld his miracles.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.680]   They are witnesses to what? Well, they're witnesses to facts. We are witnesses of these
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:21.800]   things. There is no greater denial of the gospel than to represent it merely as a philosophy,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.240]   as a collection of ideas, as one view amongst others, and to put the Lord Jesus Christ into
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:33.440]   the category of Socrates and Plato and Aristotle and the great prophets. No, no, it's not a
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:39.840]   teaching. It is a series of facts, of events, these things that have happened. They say
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:47.080]   we are witnesses of these things. And they bore witness to that. That's why the gospels
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.600]   were eventually written, in order that the facts might be made clear. That is the unique
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.160]   thing, of course, about this Christian teaching, this Christian faith. This is something which
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.920]   is based upon history. If the history isn't true, there is no gospel. As Paul puts it
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.000]   about the resurrection, "If Christ be not risen from the dead, our preaching is vain,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.400]   and your faith is in vain. You are yet in your sins." This is a gospel which is based
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:24.280]   upon facts, upon events, concrete incidents in the realm of history and their meaning.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:31.240]   And our salvation is achieved by what has taken place. We are not saved by ideas. We
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:38.960]   are saved by what God has done for us men and our salvation in and through his only
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:48.000]   begotten Son. And these men say we are witnesses to these facts, events, these things. They
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:57.720]   bore their witness, I say, to him, to his life, to his person, to his teaching, to his
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.200]   reaction to the things that happened to him, to his mighty deeds, to his death upon the
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:12.880]   cross, to his burial in a grave, and to his glorious resurrection. We've seen how were
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.240]   it not for the resurrection, there would never have been a Christian church at all. With
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.880]   this amazing honesty that characterizes the gospels, they tell us quite plainly and openly
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:30.120]   that even these chosen followers and disciples were utterly cast down and confounded by the
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.440]   death and burial of our Lord. They felt the end had come. They couldn't understand this.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.080]   They said, as the two men going on the road to Emmaus put it, "We had thought, we had
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.080]   hoped that it had been he, but he's dead, he's buried." So they bore witness to the
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.520]   resurrection, of course, because it had changed everything for them. It was that that really
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.480]   finally convinced them that this Jesus of Nazareth is none other than the only begotten
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:02.720]   eternal Son of God, the first begotten from the dead, the first to rise, declared to be
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.200]   among the dead. They'd witnessed it, he'd been amongst them for forty days, he appeared,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:23.040]   and he gave them infallible proofs. And they say, "We are witnesses of these things."
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:31.080]   But they don't stop at that. They say, "We are witnesses of these things, but so is also
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:39.960]   the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him." Now, my dear friends, these
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:47.360]   things and these alone explain to us the origin of the Christian church. These alone explain
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:54.240]   to us the continuance of the Christian church. She's in trouble, I know, today. She's
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.360]   been in trouble before. And she would have ended long ago were it not for these things,
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:07.160]   which are witnessed to by the apostles and by the Holy Ghost. But what does he mean by
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.840]   this? What does he mean by this statement that the Holy Ghost is also a witness to these
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:21.040]   things even as they are themselves? Now, let me try to answer that question. I regard this
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.120]   as one of the most important things we can ever consider together. You know, that's what
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.560]   makes a meeting like this unique. That's what differentiates this from every merely human
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:42.240]   gathering, even at its best and highest. The Holy Ghost, the unseen presence. God, the
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.440]   Holy Ghost amongst us. My dear friends, were it not for this, the outlook would be indeed
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:55.200]   completely hopeless. Completely. But with the Holy Ghost as a witness, the outlook is
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.560]   not hopeless, as I'm going to try to show you. Well, now the question is, I say, how
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:07.920]   is he a witness to these things? Well, the first answer must be this. His very coming
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:14.440]   on the day of Pentecost is a witness to these things. You see, once more we're in the realm
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:21.360]   of fact and of history. Something happened on that day of Pentecost. That's why I read
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.640]   to you those few verses from the beginning of the second chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:31.200]   of the Apostles. Here they are, these apostles, these disciples, these men who'd been with
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.960]   our Lord for three years and had accompanied with him and heard his teaching and so on.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.360]   But as I told you, they were utterly cast down. He puts them right in a sense by the
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:47.640]   resurrection, but still they're not completely right. They're waiting, they're praying. Suddenly,
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:53.080]   as they were gathered together in an upper room, suddenly there was a sound as of a mighty
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:18:01.600]   rushing wind. And you know, that's the wind that has blown the church into being. The
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:09.920]   mighty rushing wind of God, the Holy Spirit, coming upon and into the Christian church.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   And that is really, in a sense, the inauguration of the Christian church as we know her. There
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.320]   was a church in the Old Testament, let's not forget that. But as we know her, the church
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:30.480]   was inaugurated on this day of Pentecost. And here I say again, we are solidly in the
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:37.080]   realm of facts. Now I know of course that the modern man doesn't accept this as facts.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.640]   There are so many things he doesn't accept as facts. He's like the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.840]   He only believes what he likes. He doesn't believe a thing if he doesn't like it. He
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.080]   tries to explain it away. That's what they were doing, of course, with our Lord's resurrection.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.320]   And they've been trying to do the same thing ever since. And they've been trying to do
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.160]   the same thing with the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the church on the day of Pentecost.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.560]   But the solid fact is this, that if this had not happened, you and I would not be here
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:11.640]   now. It is the only explanation of it. There never would have been a church. None of these
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.240]   things would ever have happened. But as we are told, as the result of the descent of
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:24.280]   the Holy Ghost, something began to happen. And it was amazing, it was extraordinary.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.160]   It was noise abroad throughout all Jerusalem, and the people came crowding, rushing together,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.760]   "What is this?" They were amazed at this phenomenon, these simple ignorant men, talking
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.440]   these languages which they understood. And they were utterly confounded and perplexed.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.280]   And here they are, and these things go on, and the Apostle preaches to them and explains
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.160]   what this is. And we are told at the end of that second chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:55.640]   of the Apostles, that as the result of that one sermon, three thousand souls were added
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:02.280]   to the church, to the company. Now, it is very difficult for us to realize exactly the
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:08.880]   meaning of that statement. It was no small matter for a Jew to become a Christian. It
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:15.640]   would mean persecution, it would mean ostracism, it would mean his being erased out of the
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:21.720]   family record, disowned. It was a very desperately serious thing. Later threatened with death,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   but they did it. Three thousand of them. Later, another two thousand were added. This tremendous
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:35.000]   fact, phenomenon, takes place. Now, this I say is sheer history. This is the descent
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:45.240]   of the Holy Ghost. And this is a part of the witness to these things. The event itself,
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.080]   the thing that happened. We must start with that. We must always realize that what happened
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:58.120]   on the day of Pentecost is one of the series of mighty events. You notice how these people
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.760]   put it on that day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, what surprises them is this. These Cretes
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:10.520]   and Arabians and others, they say, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.780]   of God. Because that is what they were talking about. They were giving a recital of the things
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:23.680]   that God had done. And you see, that is the whole Bible. The Bible is a record, not of
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:31.120]   men's thoughts or aspirations, not the record of men's attempts to arrive at a knowledge
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:38.680]   of God. It's quite the reverse. It's a record of God's actions in the beginning, God created.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.760]   You start with the action of God and you go on. It's God acting and dealing with these
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.280]   children of Israel, creating a nation, dealing with them, sending them prophets and teachers.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.400]   And then when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:03.080]   made under the law. God acting. God delivering him up unto death. For that is what happened
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:10.200]   on Calvary. I know it was the hands of men that actually drove in the nails, if you like.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:17.040]   But it was God acting. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, him being delivered
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:23.440]   by the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God. You have taken and have crucified
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.120]   with wicked hands, but it's the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God. It is God
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.200]   who sends him to the cross. It is God who lays our sins upon him. It is God who smites
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:46.000]   him. Calvary is the act of God, not of men fundamentally. And then God raised him from
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.120]   the dead. The great fact of the resurrection. These are all facts. And then the ascension.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:00.520]   And then I say, and we must never forget this, because it belongs to the same category, the
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:06.960]   sending of the Holy Ghost upon the church on the day of Pentecost. It's history. It's
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.280]   fact. It's event. It isn't merely that a certain spirit began to manifest itself amongst
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.920]   these men as the result of their talking together and their discussions, not at all. Suddenly
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   there was a sound of a mighty rushing wind and he came and fell upon them in all the
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:31.560]   glory and the wonder of his power. Well now that is the first way then in which the Holy
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.160]   Ghost is a witness to these things. We are dealing with a concrete happening and event
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:45.080]   in history. But secondly, this of course becomes still more significant as we realize that
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:51.840]   it was the fulfillment of prophecies that had gone before. And this is what makes it
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.360]   so important for us. You see, we as Christians, we don't start with the Gospel of Matthew,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:03.120]   we start with the book of Genesis. That's what the Apostle Peter does here in his statement
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:09.200]   to the Sanhedrin. You notice how he puts it? "The God of our fathers." He's a Jew, he's
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.760]   addressing Jews. He doesn't say now we've suddenly got a new idea that nobody had ever
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   thought of before. He says, "Do you know, this thing that you can't understand is the
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.720]   fulfillment of all you claim to believe. You can't see that, but that's what it is. The
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:27.560]   God of our fathers, the God of your fathers as well as ours, the God of our Old Testament,
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.680]   the God of our Scriptures, the God of whom we've always boasted and who we've claimed
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:39.400]   as our God as over against the idols of the nations. He is the one who's done this, the
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:46.160]   continuity. And of course in this respect the coming of the Holy Ghost upon the early
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:52.000]   church on the day of Pentecost is the most crucial event. Because when you go back to
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:00.520]   your Old Testament you find that all this had been anticipated. Are you in trouble about
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:08.560]   your Christian faith? Do you get shaken by the modern criticisms? Here's the answer
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:17.000]   to it all. You see the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old. It's all been foretold
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.960]   and that's the amazing astounding thing. There is nothing more staggering than verified,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   fulfilled prophecy. You remember how this same Peter when he was an old man on the verge
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:34.120]   of the grave writes his last letter, the second epistle of Peter we call it. And there he
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.360]   tells them, he says, "Look here, when we were among you and when we preached to you,
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.960]   we didn't preach unto you cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.520]   and coming of our Lord, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty," he says. "We were with
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.520]   him on the holy mount. We saw him transfigured. We heard the voice from heaven saying, 'This
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.560]   is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.' We heard that. We are witnesses. We are living
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:04.080]   witnesses. We were there. But," says Peter, "I don't ask you to rely only upon my word
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.200]   and my witness and my testimony. There is also a more sure word of prophecy," which
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.400]   is better translated like this, "There is also a word of prophecy made more sure."
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:21.680]   How? Well, the events that have happened are the verification and the fulfillment of the
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.440]   prophecies. And then he goes on to say, he says, "Because prophecy came not in old time
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:38.680]   by the will of men." Prophecy, says Peter, is not of any private interpretation. Knowing
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:44.440]   this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. So the prophecy
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:52.640]   came not in old time by the will of men. How then? "Oh, holy men of God speak as they
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:27:00.440]   were moved, as they were carried along, as they were led, possessed by the Holy Spirit."
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.520]   Now, what does he mean by that? Well, that's his way of expanding, you see, what he said
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:12.000]   in a sentence there to the Sanhedrin. You go back and read your Old Testament prophets.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.600]   What will you find? Well, you'll find that they prophesied that God was going to raise
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:24.280]   up a Deliverer. It's amazing the detailed knowledge that they were given. They knew
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:30.240]   that he was of the tribe of Judah, the seed of David. They prophesied 800 years before
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.400]   the event that he'd be born in a little place called Bethlehem. Oh, you know the details
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.040]   that they gave. They prophesied about his death, about his riding into Jerusalem in
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:47.400]   the full of an ass and so on. It's all there. They prophesied his burial, they prophesied
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:53.440]   his resurrection, but they didn't stop at that. They prophesied that when he'd completed
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:00.800]   his work, he would send down his Spirit upon his people. You see, Peter, in preaching on
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   the day of Pentecost, makes use of this very argument. Here they are, you see, these men
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:11.280]   now baptized, filled with the Spirit, talking in these unknown tongues, and the crowd comes
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.120]   together. Some mockingly say these men are full of new wine, but Peter, standing up with
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.080]   the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, "You men of Judea and all you that dwell
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.680]   at Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken unto my words, for these are not drunken,
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:31.840]   as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day, but this is that which was
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.800]   spoken by the prophet Joel. It shall come to pass, says Joel, in the last days, says
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:43.600]   God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.280]   prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, and on
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.640]   my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:01.480]   prophesy, and I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath, blood
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.840]   and fire and vapour of smoke, the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.440]   blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come, and it shall come to pass that
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:21.280]   whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Ye men of Israel, hear
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.160]   these words. He then begins to tell them how all this has been fulfilled in this person
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:33.440]   of Jesus of Nazareth. And he says this is the only explanation of this thing that has
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.720]   been happening amongst you. Listen to him. "Men and brethren, let me speak to you freely
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.120]   of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried. His sepulcher is with us unto
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.320]   this day. But he, therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.360]   to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.680]   sit on his throne, he seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:03.200]   his soul should not be left in hell, neither his flesh could see corruption. This Jesus,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.440]   God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:14.120]   exalted and having received the promise of the Father, the promise of the Holy Ghost,
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:22.280]   he hath shed forth this which you now see and hear." Now there, you see, is the point
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:30.560]   of this argument. The Old Testament prophets, Joel and Ezekiel and others, they had been
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:37.400]   given a revelation of all this by God, by the Holy Spirit himself. It was he who gave
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:43.720]   these men this knowledge and understanding. It is an utter travesty of the teaching of
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   the Bible to think of the Old Testament prophets as just wise philosophers, men surrounded
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.880]   by libraries and books, comparing thought with thought, and trying to understand the
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.240]   times in which they lived, and giving a contemporary message. They had a contemporary message,
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.360]   but they had a future message also. They foretold as well as foretold, and never forget this
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:13.880]   element of foretelling. It is the great argument that is used not only by these apostles, but
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.600]   by the Lord Jesus Christ himself. He is always referring them to the Scriptures. He says,
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:24.200]   "Can't you see I am fulfilling them?" Very well, it is the Holy Spirit who has given
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:34.120]   them the knowledge, and now he has come upon the Church on the day of Pentecost, and thereby
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:40.720]   the prophecies have been fulfilled. He is a witness to the truth of these things. He
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:47.480]   is the last event in this great series, these wonderful works of God. Or if you like, we
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:56.560]   can put it like this. John the Baptist, he is the forerunner of our Lord, these strange
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:04.320]   men. After a silence of some four hundred years, after the writing of the prophet Malachi,
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:11.760]   suddenly they begin to hear of a strange man in the wilderness, John, preaching a baptism
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.040]   of repentance for the remission of sins. And they crowded out to hear him. And he was an
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.920]   amazing man. They had never heard anybody like him, with his blazing eyes, his ascetic
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:28.960]   life, clad in camel hair, shirt as it were, eating nothing but locusts and wild honey.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.880]   These men speaking with authority and calling people to repentance, unafraid of Pharisees
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:39.800]   and doctors of the law, speaking to all alike, and denouncing their sin and their hypocrisy,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.840]   telling them that they are unworthy to be called the children of Abraham, that God could
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:49.280]   raise a people like them even out of stones. And the people listened, and they began to
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.520]   muse in their hearts, and they said to one another, "Is not this the Christ?" And
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.840]   John heard them, and he turns upon them, and this is what he says to them, "I am not
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:06.480]   the Christ. There cometh one mightier than I after me, the lecher of whose shoes I am
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:14.360]   unworthy to earn loose. I indeed baptize you with water. He shall baptize you with the
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:21.200]   Holy Ghost, and with fire whose fen is in his hand, and he will truly purge his floor,
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:27.600]   and gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.680]   That's it, says John. I'm not the Christ. The Christ is the one who will baptize with
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.760]   the Holy Ghost. But the Holy Ghost has come. The baptism has descended. What does it tell
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:45.160]   us? Oh, this is the Christ. Jesus is the Christ. The resurrection alone doesn't prove it.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.240]   The descent, the baptism with the Holy Ghost is the final, the ultimate proof. Or take
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.560]   it if you like. In terms of what we read in a great and notable and most important statement
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.360]   in the seventh chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John, the last day of the feast.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   You remember it? "In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:15.080]   'Listen to this, beloved friends. Are you in trouble? Are you weary and heavy laden?
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:23.720]   Are you tired and exhausted? Are you thirsty in life and defeated? If any man thirst, let
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:33.280]   him come unto me and drink. He that believeth in me, as the scripture hath said, out of
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:39.520]   his belly shall flow rivers of living water.'" And then John's explanation. "But this spake
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.800]   he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive. For the Holy Ghost
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:52.760]   was not yet given because the Jesus was not yet glorified." This is prophecy. Our Lord
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:58.280]   himself prophesied this. And you see, if the Holy Ghost hadn't come, he would have been
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:04.280]   a false prophet. He claims that he's going to send him, and that the result of his coming
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.760]   will be that men and women shall be so satisfied that out of their innermost parts shall flow
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.240]   rivers of living water. If the Holy Ghost hadn't come on the day of Pentecost, his
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:20.600]   words would have been falsified. But they're fulfilled. Therefore the Holy Ghost is a witness.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.440]   It's the final proof that he is who and what he claimed to be. We are not the only witnesses,
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:31.600]   says the apostle. So is also the Holy Ghost, which God hath given to them that obey him,
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:38.400]   or take it as it's put in the 14th chapter of John's Gospel. Listen to our Lord again
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.000]   just before the end of his life. "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.480]   comforter, that he shall abide with you forever. Even the Spirit of truth and the world cannot
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   receive, because it seeth him, not neither knoweth him." Not surprising that people
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.880]   don't believe in the Holy Ghost, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the day of
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.720]   Pentecost. Our Lord has told us that the world cannot believe in him, and never will, and
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.640]   it never has done. There's nothing new about that, my friends. Don't regard denial of
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.960]   the Gospel and this message about the Holy Ghost as the hallmark of modernity. It's
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.760]   the old sin of the Pharisees, the self-righteous people, who think that they can please God
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:31.400]   without being born again, and without being filled with the Spirit. "The world seeth
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.520]   him not, and knoweth him not, but you know him. For he dwelleth with you, and shall be
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.320]   in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, yet a little while, and
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.760]   the world seeth me no more." And so on. Here he is, you see, promising them. He said
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:53.160]   later on, "It is expedient for you that I go away." What? Is the thing possible?
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.240]   How can it be a good thing for the followers and the disciples that the teacher should
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.600]   leave them? He's only been with them three years. They haven't got notebooks. They
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.520]   couldn't take notes. And he's going to leave them. And he says, "Not only am I
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.600]   leaving, it's a good thing for you that I go." Good thing that he should... "Expedient
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:15.840]   for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you. But
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:23.400]   if I go away, I will send him unto you, and he, he'll lead you into all truth. He will
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:28.520]   convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment to come. He, I'm not leaving
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.920]   you orphans, I'm not leaving you alone. I'm sending him, the other Comforter. And
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.160]   if he hadn't come on the day of Pentecost, Christ again would have been falsified as
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:43.000]   a prophet and as a teacher. It's the final proof. He is the witness to these things,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   much more so than the apostles. This, you see, is the meaning of what we are told here.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.840]   And then you remember how at the very end of all, after the resurrection, even immediately
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:03.280]   before his ascension, our Lord used words like these. "Being assembled together with
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.100]   them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:15.440]   of the Father, which saith he, have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water,
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:23.320]   but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." That's it. "You
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:28.680]   shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and you shall be witnesses
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:35.480]   unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:43.720]   of the earth." Here is his promise, here is his claim. And the descent of the Holy
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:50.380]   Ghost on the day of Pentecost is the fulfillment of it, the verification of it. We are witnesses
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:58.080]   of these things, so is also the Holy Ghost. This mighty, amazing event, it's the final
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.960]   proof that he is the Son of God, the one whom God has raised up as a prince and a savior
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:13.840]   of the world. That's the second way in which he bears this witness. Let me hurry to a third.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:21.200]   The change in the apostles. We are witnesses of these things, but what makes us witnesses?
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:27.520]   How have we ever become witnesses? This is a most important question. My friends, read
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:36.400]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Read your Gospels before that. Look at these men,
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:44.160]   see what they were. The great members of the Sanhedrin in their patronizing manner, we
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:51.120]   are told that they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men. And so they were.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.720]   Perfectly right, there's nothing wrong in that. They were unlearned and they were ignorant
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:02.600]   men. They had no knowledge, they'd had no training, they were not Pharisees, scribes,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:09.960]   Sadducees, nothing of the kind. Artisans, fishermen, ordinary workmen, that was the
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:16.360]   sort of people they were. Not only that, very cowardly. This was the greatest friend they'd
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.720]   ever known, this Jesus, and yet they all forsook him and fled when he was arrested and brought
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:28.840]   face to face with death. Cowards, craven spirited men. That's what they were. But look at them
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:35.960]   here. Listen to them. Here are the people of whom we are told that after our Lord's
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.840]   death they met together in an upper room and locked the doors because they were afraid
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:45.720]   of the Jews. Peter denied him with oaths and cursing. He said he didn't know, he meant
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.760]   it had nothing to do with him. But look at him. Here he is, he stands up on the day of
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:54.080]   Pentecost and he preaches without fear. And here he's doing it again, though he's been
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.640]   imprisoned twice, though he's threatened with death. He says, he looks into the face of
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:05.160]   this great authority and says, "We ought to obey God rather than you." What's happened?
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.320]   What is this? But my dear friends, this is Christianity you know. Christianity is not
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:17.000]   just to criticize the policy of South Africa and the Parthet. That's not Christianity.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.120]   There are people who are not Christians at all who do that and do it very well. Christianity
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.600]   is not just a constant protest against atomic bombs and war. People can do that who are
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.800]   not Christians at all. It may be included, all right, but that's not Christianity, I
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.760]   say. What is it? Oh, Christianity is that which changes a man completely, gives him
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.400]   a new birth, makes him a new man, transforms him entirely, as had happened to these people.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   That's the Christian faith, thank God it is. It isn't something that just comes to
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.140]   me as a wonderful idea and I must have been to some university before I can follow the
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:59.520]   philosophical jargon and terminology. Thank God, no, no, the common people heard him gladly.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:06.400]   It's something that changes a man, transforms him, gives him a new mind and a new understanding.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.320]   The descent of the Holy Ghost is the only explanation of these people. You can't explain
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:16.600]   them in any other terms and that's why the Holy Ghost is a witness, even through them
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:24.160]   and their witness to the truth of these particular things. Now, you know people today, in their
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.080]   cleverness and suppositive wisdom, they try to persuade us that they can explain the whole
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:34.160]   of Christianity and the favourite explanation, of course, in this present century has been
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.840]   the psychological one. All can be explained so simply, psychologically. They say, "Look
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.720]   at these people, these Christians, what accounts for them?" Well, they say they belong to
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:50.080]   a certain type. There are types of personality. They have analysed a large number of people
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.080]   and they've discovered that there are certain types and amongst them there is the religious
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.120]   type. There are some people who are born religious, some are not. "All right," they say, "there's
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.880]   no need to quarrel. If you're helped by religion, have it by all means, but don't say that everybody
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:09.240]   should have it. Don't say that it's essential to all. You're just the religious type. You
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:15.040]   all, you have the religious complex." These are the explanations that they try to put
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.000]   forward, isn't it? And they would explain what happened on the day of Pentecost as a
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.040]   case of mass hysteria. That's what they actually do. But you see, this is the difficulty. This
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:33.400]   is where they fly in the face of facts, as the Sanhedrin did. They won't face the facts.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.920]   They're trying to weave a little theory to explain their little understanding, for the
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:45.400]   facts are these, that there in the very body of the apostles, without going any further,
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:52.040]   you have men of all kinds of different temperaments and psychological make-ups. You have it right
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:57.360]   through the New Testament. I can't imagine two more different men than Paul and John.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:03.280]   I can't imagine two more different men than John and Peter. Psychological type. There's
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.720]   a conceivable type here. And as you come down the running century, what you find are the
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:13.280]   only people who are Christians, some ignorant, unlettered people. No, no, some of the giant
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:20.000]   intellects of all time have been humble Christians. Oh, I could mention the long list to you.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.120]   I always rather like doing it. You know, it's a wonderful, "Ethanasius Contramundum." One
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.680]   man with his gigantic understanding, standing up against the whole church and world, as
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:39.640]   it were, "St. Augustine." What an intellect. What a colossus of a man. What a giant. You
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.600]   can put all these little Christians into one class, religious complex. They've just gone
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:50.000]   soft. They're just the emotional type. Why don't you face the facts, my dear friend?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.680]   No, no, there's no explanation. You can't explain. You've had all types, varying in
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:01.240]   ability, varying in temperament, varying in everything else, and yet they're all brought
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:07.760]   to a common denominator. They all become one, and they all glory in the same great and wonderful
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:17.640]   salvation. You can't explain the apostles in terms of men who are just suffering from
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:23.240]   mass hysteria. Could a man suffering from hysteria write the epistle to the Romans and
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.440]   the epistle to the Ephesians, do you think? Why, if you want a little intellectual exercise,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.200]   there it is for you. You begin to read the epistle to the Ephesians, and come and tell
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:40.040]   me when you've really understood it. I don't expect to see you for some time. No, no, my
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:49.000]   dear friend. Here it is, giant intellects, simple people. The great sage and philosopher,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.520]   the little child, all believing the same message, all participating in the same new life, all
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:02.600]   rejoicing together in the great salvation. What accounts for it? You can't explain it
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:08.000]   psychologically in any shape or form. A man tried to do it a few years ago. I was privileged
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.080]   to give a little reply to him. I was told that first he was going to answer me at once.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:18.320]   He still hasn't answered me. And there's only one reason for that, he can't answer me. He
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:25.480]   can't explain the origin. He can't explain the first man who gets this experience. And
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:31.760]   until he does that, his argument about mass hysteria goes by in the barn. No, no. There's
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.880]   only one explanation. It is that they're filled with the Holy Ghost. Look at their joy and
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.560]   exultation. Look at their courage and their boldness, I say. Look how their fear has suddenly
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:48.440]   left them. Look at the way in which they speak, not only with other tongues, but in their
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:53.120]   own tongue. Look at the new understanding they've got of the scriptures. Look how Peter
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:59.920]   can expound it and explain it. He couldn't have before. What is this? Oh, it's the power
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:06.080]   of the Holy Ghost. And this is, I say, the very essence of our gospel. It isn't what
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:12.480]   men can do, it's what God can enable him to do. It's God coming into a man in the Holy
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.960]   Spirit and giving him life anew and new ability and all he stands in need of. Look at the
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.480]   miracles that they've worked. As I showed you at the beginning, they're in trouble and
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.560]   they're on trial because they've worked a miracle. Peter could no more work a miracle
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.320]   than I can. No, John, they say, why look ye on us? As by our own power or godliness we
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:38.360]   have made this man to walk. It isn't us. It's his name. Through faith in his name that hath
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:44.320]   given this man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. And we have been enabled
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:49.840]   to do it because he has put his Spirit upon us and in us. And we are filled with a divine
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:54.720]   energy. We are repeating the kind of thing that he did when he was here himself in the
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:03.680]   flesh. That's the argument. And that is, you see, how Christianity spread. Christianity
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:10.640]   spreading because a group of fishermen and women and illiterate people just band themselves
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:16.280]   together and have a prayer meeting. The thing is quite monstrous. It's insanity. No, no,
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:21.640]   there's only one explanation. It is that they were transformed, transfigured, renewed, given
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:27.400]   the power above themselves. They've become the vehicles and the channels of the power
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.760]   of the Holy Ghost that is working in them and through them. And that, of course, is
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.000]   the case that is argued everywhere in the New Testament. Listen to the author of the
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.240]   epistle to the Hebrews putting it. He puts it like this. Why ought we to listen to this
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:46.000]   gospel? Here's his answer in the second chapter. We ought to give them our earnest heed to
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.640]   the things that we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:56.200]   of God spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:03.480]   a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:09.400]   which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:17.280]   heard him? God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and divers miracles
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will. That's how it spread. There would
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:30.120]   never have been a Christian church but for this. And yet men tell us that they don't
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:37.320]   believe in the Holy Ghost nor in signs, wonders, nor miracles because, they say, of the scientific
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:42.840]   knowledge of the mid-twentieth century. I'm not surprised they're emptying their churches.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:47.240]   What I'm amazed is that anybody still troubles to go and listen to them. You can get that
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:51.480]   from your newspapers or on the street corner. That's a denial of it, not a preaching of
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:58.560]   it. No, no. God also bearing them witness. And if he hadn't, there would never have
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:03.560]   been a Christian church. She would never have come into being and she certainly would never
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:09.200]   have continued. But the Holy Ghost has come and he acts, you see, and he acts as we see
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.760]   in the second chapter of that book of the Acts of the Apostles. What does he do? Oh,
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.960]   he can do the impossible. I can't save a soul. Nobody else can. I know some men claim they
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:27.040]   can. They can't. They get decisions. No man can save a soul. The Holy Ghost alone can
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:34.040]   save a soul. No man and his speaking and his argumentation can ever convince anybody of
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:39.080]   sin and righteousness and judgment to come. The Holy Ghost alone can do it. And on the
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.920]   day of Pentecost, even through the mouth of an ignorant fisherman like Peter, he did it.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.800]   As he was preaching, we are told, they were pricked in their hearts and they cried out
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:57.400]   saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" It wasn't Peter. It was the Holy Ghost. And
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.240]   thus he bears his witness and testimony to the truth of these things. He convicts us
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:09.040]   of our sin. He makes us face ourselves in a way that nothing and no one else can ever
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:15.200]   do. He shows us our emptiness and woe. He puts us on our backs in utter helplessness
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:25.000]   and then blessed be his name. He enables us to discern Jesus as the Son of God. He gives
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.240]   us insight into the meaning of his death upon the cross. We see verily, as John the Baptist
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:36.320]   said, that he is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. We see him as God's
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:42.960]   pascal lamb. We see God laying on him the iniquity of us all and punishing him that
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:49.400]   we might be forgiven. Now men can understand that. I'm not surprised they don't believe
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:54.840]   in the doctrine of the atonement. To human wisdom it's not only impossible, it's ridiculous.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:01.160]   But not to a man enlightened by the Holy Spirit. It is Christ, the power of God and the wisdom
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:08.120]   of God. It is God's own amazing way of preparing a way of salvation and delivering us from
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:15.800]   the condemnation of his own holy law. Three thousand believe it. And it's solely the
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:23.040]   result of the operation of the Holy Spirit of God. And he fills them, as you notice,
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:29.640]   with life anew. We read of them as eating their bread with joy and gladness, praising
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:35.600]   God from day to day, continuing steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:41.480]   and breaking of bread and prayer. They're afraid of nobody. They've got new life. They're
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:47.320]   born from the dead. Death has lost its terror. They've had a vision and a glimpse of glory
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:54.440]   with God in eternity. And the Holy Spirit has given it all to them. And so he is a witness
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:53:02.240]   of these things. He is a witness of the fact that God has raised up Jesus and set him up
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:09.920]   as a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And my
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:17.600]   dear friends, he not only began to do that on the day of Pentecost and in the early days
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:24.560]   of the early church in the first century. Thank God he's gone on doing it. And that
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:32.680]   is why I say in spite of all appearances today, I'm not dejected and I'm not discouraged.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:38.920]   I have faith in what? Modern scholarship? Most certainly not. Scholarship? Scholarship
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:45.240]   denies because it's bound by men's understanding. Modern scholarship, it will take everything
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:51.480]   from us, everything that really is gospel, the power of God through the Holy Spirit.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:58.360]   No, no, my hope is in this, in the Holy Ghost as a witness of these things. What do I mean?
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:03.880]   I mean this. Look at the story of the Christian church. Look at it throughout the centuries.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:08.480]   What do you see? Well, here it is starting at Pentecost in this great outpouring of the
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:13.760]   Spirit. And it continues like that. Troubles begin even in the times of the New Testament,
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.800]   go on through the centuries. You'll find it becomes institutionalized. It becomes important.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.320]   It develops bishops and other accretions. It then becomes wealthy. It can no longer
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.360]   say silver and gold are by none because it's got so much of it, so much of it that it's
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:35.880]   afraid for the public to be told how much. That's it, isn't it? And that's why things
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:41.760]   are as they are in the church and in the world. But how is the church still here at all? That's
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.640]   the amazing thing. Men would have wrecked it and destroyed it times without number.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:52.160]   There's only one thing that explains the continuance and the persistence of the Christian
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:59.920]   church tonight. It is the Holy Ghost, the revivals of history, the repetition, if you
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.400]   like, of what happened on the day of Pentecost. And this is the amazing thing about it. You
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:11.480]   read the story of the reformations and revivals. This is what you'll find. The church has
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:21.800]   become weak, become ignorant, become worldly, become moribund, become almost dead. Then
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:30.520]   suddenly and in an utterly inexplicable manner, God again sends forth his Spirit, perhaps
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:36.800]   on a man, perhaps on a company, and they become alive and they're renewed and they're filled
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:42.680]   with power. Their world becomes irresistible. And the church goes on to a new period of
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:51.080]   revival, reformation, renewal, reawakening. And were it not for that, the church, I say
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:56:01.880]   again, would long since have ceased to be at all. You can't explain revivals in terms
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:06.360]   of psychology and mass hysteria. The question you've got to answer is this. How did the
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:14.800]   first men get changed? What happened to Whitefield? What happened to Wesley? How do you explain
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:20.240]   it? You can't explain it except in these terms. The Spirit that came upon these apostles
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:26.480]   came upon them. My dear friends, this is how all the different parts of the Christian church
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.600]   have ever come into being. They've all started in revival, but then they become respectable
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:39.560]   and lose their power. And there's only one hope still, and that is that the Holy Spirit
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:47.200]   is still there and he still witnesses to these things. We are witnesses of these things.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:53.520]   And so is also the Holy Ghost, which God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.800]   Well now, my friends, I bring it therefore to a close by putting a question to you. There's
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:04.520]   the story, there are the facts. That's why we go on preaching these things. That's why
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:10.480]   apostles, defies and hedrons. That is why I am worthy to be mentioned in the same breath
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   as them in this degenerate, evil, modern twentieth century of ours, with all its pride of learning,
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:22.560]   which doesn't produce much good living, I notice, and which leads to a world of chaos
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:29.560]   and confusion and shame and ugliness and sin. That is why I say, "Let men say what they
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:39.080]   please." We ought to obey God rather than men. This is God's truth, and its message
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:47.880]   is this. And thank God for it. Whatever you have been in your past life, however much
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:56.440]   of a failure, however great a sinner. If you but see tonight that that is your condition,
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:03.440]   that you have nothing to expect but the punishment that you so richly deserve, if you but repent
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:10.240]   and acknowledge and confess that, and believe this witness and this testimony, that Jesus
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:15.880]   is the Son of God, who has come out of the eternal glory into this world in order to
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:21.040]   save us and redeem us, and that he did it even by dying for us on the cross, and he
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:26.760]   is risen again, and will give you a spirit and give you new life, new power, and ultimately
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:35.760]   receive you into the everlasting glory with himself. That's the message. Are you going
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:43.160]   to be foolish as the Sanhedrin was, and refuse it and reject it? It's not merely the witness
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:48.280]   of the apostles and the saints of the centuries, and a feeble little preacher in Westminster
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:59:01.520]   Chapel on a Sunday night in April 1966. So is also the Holy Ghost. Listen to him. Submit
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:08.200]   to him. Has he been dealing with you? Haven't you felt his power? Hasn't he made your little
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:13.080]   arguments look rather ridiculous and foolish? Hasn't your conscience been awakened? Don't
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:17.360]   you know you're wrong? Very well, give in to him. Let him lead you on still further
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:23.080]   into repentance, and then as he holds before you the Son of God, your Savior, bleeding,
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:29.760]   dying for you, rising to save you and to justify you, waiting to receive you, believe him.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:37.640]   Repent. Believe the gospel. And you'll be more amazed than you've ever been in your
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:45.000]   life. And then the Holy Ghost will witness to you that all your sins are forgiven, that
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.040]   you are a child of God, that you can smile in the face of death and look forward to the
[00:59:52.040 --> 01:00:01.360]   glories of eternity in the presence of God. Amen.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.440]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
