[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Next Tuesday, we celebrate July 4th, Independence Day, as we call it here in the States, and
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440]   the day raises questions about national loyalty and how we as Christians think through issues
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.400]   of how can we be an American, but also a stranger, an exile, an alien, a pilgrim.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.060]   And that was our topic, really, that we addressed back in episode number 378 in years past.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.160]   This year, we're looking at the topic, but we're looking at the implications of it on
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.640]   the local church.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.960]   And last time on Wednesday, we talked about the place of patriotism in the local church
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   and we heard from a pastor, a listener to the podcast named Scott, who is uneasy about
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.780]   what he sees in the church that he inherited.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.440]   In this situation, Pastor John, when a pastor has inherited a strongly patriotic church
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.220]   where the patriotism is expressed in Sunday gatherings, how should a pastor who agrees
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.360]   with what you said last time, what should the pastor do next in leading that church
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   well?
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.080]   Well, in that previous podcast, on this question, I said that I've been in several patriotic
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.860]   services that seemed to me to be out of sync, out of proportion to the biblical realities
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520]   relating to the kingdom of Christ and our radical allegiance to him.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.180]   And I suggested seven biblical principles that would inform how a church thinks about
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.480]   such services and constructs them.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.920]   But I'm very aware that it's one thing to know principles, and it's another thing to
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.680]   be part of a church that has a long tradition of services with extended focus on each of
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.760]   the military branches and corresponding songs and corresponding flags and marches and decorations
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.120]   in red, white, and blue.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.660]   And I share Scott's discomfort—Scott's the one who posed this question—I share
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.620]   his discomfort with those services for reasons that I think are pretty obvious from the principles.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.040]   But what do you do if you have inherited such a church, if you're a pastor or an elder
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.580]   or just a member of the church?
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.260]   So here's my suggestions to the pastors who are in these churches and feel like things
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.300]   have perhaps, over time, just gotten out of hand.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.860]   Number one, patiently week in and week out, preach Bible-saturated, God-centered, Christ-exalting,
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.260]   man-humbling sermons that by implication so elevate the lordship of Christ over every
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.580]   detail of life with such majesty that little by little the church begins to absorb the
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.220]   mindset that our highest affections and our only absolute allegiance belongs to Jesus
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.840]   Christ, willingly, eagerly, joyfully, no regrets, no restraint.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.420]   So don't make the lordship of Christ over all of life an issue only on a controversial
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.420]   weekend.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.220]   Do it all the time.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.620]   If you do this all the time, within a few years, I think you won't be the only one
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.020]   who's feeling uncomfortable with those services.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.420]   Number two, discuss your concerns with your trusted leaders of the church, your fellow
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.980]   elders, if you have elders or whoever.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.780]   Until you get some of them on board with you, any change is probably going to be futile
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.940]   and maybe destructive.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.940]   Pray with them.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.380]   Open the word with them.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.580]   Share your heart with them.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.020]   Be patient with them.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.660]   Show them the positive outcomes, not just any losses they might perceive.
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:57.580]   Number three, along with your elders, approach some of your most biblically shaped veterans—I'm
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.900]   talking military veterans—in the church and share with them your love for them, your
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.180]   appreciation and your value of their sacrifices and risks, and let them see how you relate
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.340]   the kingdom of Christ to all of that.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.620]   See if you can portray a vision for them that would capture their imagination of what it
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.180]   might look like in a more Christ-exalting way.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.260]   If you could get one or two of those folks advocating with you, you might be a long way
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.780]   towards winning the others as well.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.740]   Number four, be a man of courage and humility and fearlessness in dealing with this issue.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.900]   The last thing you want to communicate is that Christianity is somehow a wimpy religion
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.340]   that's afraid of risk, afraid of danger, afraid of sacrifice and death, and that's
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.300]   why it doesn't want to talk about the military.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.780]   No, no, no.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.580]   It is in fact exactly the opposite.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:09.020]   One very practical demonstration of this might be that on one or two Sundays a year you would
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.940]   choose to highlight missionaries, either alive or dead, in the history of the church who
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.780]   have paid the supreme price, not to advance the American way, but to advance an even greater
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.180]   good, namely eternal salvation that comes in the kingdom of Christ.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.140]   They too are worthy of our most focused gratitude.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:43.100]   Number five, in whatever changes you pursue, show that there is gain and not just loss.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:51.780]   When I came to Bethlehem in 1980, the American flag and the so-called Christian flag were
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.100]   in the sanctuary at the front on either side of the platform.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.020]   Now I never said a word about it for 10 years, I don't think.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.300]   I could, I maybe did and don't remember, but as far as I can remember, they just sat there
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.020]   and I didn't say a word about that, though I felt, "Hmm, what does that mean?"
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.780]   In the sanctuary, in the worshiping place, at the front, featured, foregrounded.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.940]   Then we built a new sanctuary in 1990 and moved in in '91, and the issue was, "Will
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.180]   the flags be moved in there?"
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:36.780]   And at that point, I led the charge, the elders agreed, "Let's put the flags in the commons
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.740]   on either side of the steps where people go in and out from the world into worship, from
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.540]   the worship into the world."
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.700]   And I argued that the rationale was simple.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.860]   As you come and go from the house of the Lord, you pass from a place outside where we live
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.900]   in large measure under the authorities of this nation to a place inside where we celebrate
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.560]   and put all the focus on our heavenly citizenship and our submission to the supreme lordship
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.740]   of Christ, and therefore, if we're going to have these flags, this is a really reasonable
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.900]   place to have them, and we've never had a controversy about it for 20-plus years.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.820]   Nobody ever thinks about it, probably, but I think it's a good compromise.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:28.860]   Number six, perhaps you will scale back aspects of the service and weave into the services
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.860]   expressions of repentance and the lordship of Christ that's been missing, and in the
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:41.520]   sermon, you can provide repeated nuancing for the way Christians have to deal with any
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.860]   human allegiance and help the people understand.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:50.420]   And the last thing, number seven, that I would say is expect conflict on this.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.480]   We probably lost a couple of people over that moving of the flags.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.460]   They put the worst face on it, not the best, but after you've ministered for long enough,
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.760]   you win the trust of enough biblical people, love them, the folks that are unhappy, go
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.780]   after them, tell them you care about them, you don't want to disrespect them, and in
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:19.420]   the long run, the winnowing effect, I believe, in the church will probably be good for God-centered
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:25.740]   Christ-exalting Bible-saturated atmosphere that you are trying to create.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.740]   Amen.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.700]   Thank you for your practical thoughts here, Pastor John.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.660]   And Scott, thank you for the excellent question, and I pray that these two episodes have been
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.500]   helpful for you as you lead your church.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.460]   And as you can hear, we're working through some audio issues on Pastor John's end.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.100]   Thank you for your patience as we work through the connection and get things fixed so that
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.220]   Pastor John comes through more clearly.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.500]   Well, the weekend is upon us, and next week, listen to this lineup.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.660]   We're going to look at remarriage after the death of a spouse.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.980]   Then we're going to look at sleep patterns, how much sleep is laziness and how little
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.220]   sleep is arrogance, and how do we find that balance of sleep in our lives.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.700]   A listener wants to know, and then we will look at the tension of ego and cultivating
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.180]   big ambitions for God.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.900]   It's going to be a very interesting week on the podcast next week.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.100]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Monday, Lord willing, of course.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.740]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.740]   [END]
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.740]   [END]
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.740]   [END]
