[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.180]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.880]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.680]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.840]   Today, we are going to discuss sugar,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.960]   in particular, how our nervous system regulates
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.100]   our sugar intake and our seeking of sugar.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.280]   We're also going to discuss how sugar
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.800]   regulates our nervous system.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.240]   And as you'll soon learn,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.040]   sugar really impacts our brain and body
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.920]   by two main mechanisms.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.000]   One of those mechanisms is based on the sweet taste of sugar,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.940]   which itself is rewarding.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.640]   Even if you're not much of a sweet tooth,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.040]   I confess I'm not,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.080]   most people enjoy sweet tastes more than bitter tastes.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.880]   And the sweet taste of sugar and its various forms
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.460]   is strongly reinforcing,
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.780]   meaning it triggers the activation of neurons,
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.280]   nerve cells in the brain and body
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.040]   that make us want to consume more of that sweet substance.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.860]   Incidentally, sweet tastes also make us want to eat
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.140]   more of other substances as well.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.940]   You may be familiar with that phenomenon.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.800]   Now, sugar also triggers mechanisms in the brain and body
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.860]   based on its nutritive content,
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.680]   independent of its sweetness.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.000]   What that means is that the actual caloric content
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.780]   and the way that sugar interacts with your nervous system
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.880]   at a subconscious level without your awareness
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.860]   also impacts your craving and seeking of sugar
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.460]   and other foods.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.480]   Today, we are going to discuss what happens
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.040]   when you ingest sugar in terms of your body's reaction
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.620]   and your brain's reaction.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.020]   We're also going to talk about what happens
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.360]   when you don't ingest enough sugar.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.600]   Because as it turns out,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.300]   sugar is such a powerful fuel for the brain
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.440]   that under conditions where people don't ingest enough sugar
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.360]   or where their so-called blood glucose,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.960]   which is basically blood sugar of a particular form
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.660]   gets too low, their neurons don't function as well.
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.480]   That said, there are conditions of very low blood sugar
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.180]   in which neurons can function even better.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.560]   So today we're going to talk about the ins and outs,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.960]   the ups and downs of sugar
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.440]   as it relates to your nervous system.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.900]   And by the end of this episode,
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.300]   I'm confident that you have a much clearer picture
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.560]   as to how much sugar you should be ingesting,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.400]   whether or not you should avoid sugars
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.680]   that you're currently eating,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.300]   and you will certainly understand much, much more
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.740]   about the energy and fuel sources that your brain relies on,
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.720]   which I'm certain will allow you to make
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.560]   better informed choices about the foods you eat and avoid
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.280]   toward mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.940]   I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.940]   this May.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.680]   The first live event will be hosted in Seattle, Washington
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.160]   on May 17th.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.800]   The second live event will be hosted in Portland, Oregon
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.160]   on May 18th.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   Both are part of a lecture series entitled
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.740]   The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.800]   during which I will discuss science and science-based tools
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.440]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.840]   And I should point out that while some of the material
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.520]   I'll cover will overlap with information covered here
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.340]   on the Huberman Lab podcast and on various social media
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.640]   posts, most of the information I will cover
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.180]   is going to be distinct from information covered
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.040]   on the podcast or elsewhere.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.560]   So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.920]   Portland on May 18th.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.000]   You can access tickets by going to Hubermanlab.com/tour,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.480]   and I hope to see you there.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.000]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.600]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.480]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.680]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.240]   In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.700]   of today's podcast.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.720]   Our first sponsor is Thesus.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.000]   Thesus makes what are called nootropics,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.760]   which means smart drugs.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.080]   Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.720]   I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.640]   I don't believe that there's any one substance
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.720]   or collection of substances that can make us smarter.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.080]   I do believe, based on science, however,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.620]   that there are particular neural circuits
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.180]   and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.900]   more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.300]   That's just the way that the brain works,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.820]   different neural circuits for different brain states.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.860]   And so the idea of a nootropic that's just going to make us
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.420]   smarter all around fails to acknowledge that
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.220]   smarter is many things, right?
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.300]   If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math,
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.500]   you're doing accounting, a different part of the day,
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.340]   you need to be creative.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.540]   These are all different brain processes.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.060]   Thesus understands this.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.400]   And as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.700]   to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.220]   They only use the highest quality ingredients,
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.580]   which of course is essential.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.260]   Some of those I've talked about on the podcast,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.140]   things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.220]   They give you the ability to try several different blends
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.500]   over the course of a month,
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.240]   discover which nootropics work best
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.540]   for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.420]   And with that personalization, design a kit of nootropics
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.780]   that's ideal for the different brain and body states
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.820]   you want to access.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.120]   I've been using Thesus for more than six months now,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.060]   and I can confidently say that the nootropics
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.740]   have been a total game changer.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.420]   My go-to formula is the clarity formula,
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.560]   or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.580]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.540]   go online to take thesis.com/huberman,
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.520]   take a three minute quiz,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.500]   and Thesus will send you four different formulas
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.140]   to try in your first month.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.340]   That's take thesis.com/huberman
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.980]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.980]   for 10% off your first order.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.420]   now called AG1.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.460]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.380]   drink.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.260]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.700]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.420]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.820]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.100]   once or twice a day is that it helps me cover
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.880]   all of my basic nutritional needs.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.380]   It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.380]   In addition, it has probiotics,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.980]   which are vital for microbiome health.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.840]   I've done a couple of episodes now
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.740]   on the so-called gut microbiome
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.540]   and the ways in which the microbiome interacts
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.420]   with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.780]   and essentially with every biological system
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.520]   relevant to health throughout your brain and body.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.300]   With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.300]   the minerals I need,
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.100]   and the probiotics to support my microbiome.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.500]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.120]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.600]   and claim a special offer.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.380]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.100]   which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.220]   while you're on the road,
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.500]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.020]   There are a ton of data now showing
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.740]   that vitamin D3 is essential
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.980]   for various aspects of our brain and body health.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.060]   Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine,
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.460]   many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.900]   And K2 is also important
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.100]   because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.420]   calcium in the body, and so on.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.220]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.700]   to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.420]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.380]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.020]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.660]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.220]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.100]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.880]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.220]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.280]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.820]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.420]   What's unique about Inside Tracker is that
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.680]   while there are a lot of different tests out there
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.360]   for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.340]   with Inside Tracker, you get the numbers back
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.500]   in terms of your levels,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.520]   but they also give you very clear directives
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.220]   in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.860]   that can help you bring those values into the ranges
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.960]   that are best for you and your health goals.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.180]   And that's very different than a lot of the other programs
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.160]   where you get a lot of information,
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.320]   but you don't really know what to do with that information.

[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.260]   Okay, let's talk about sugar.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.600]   Let's talk about how sugar impacts your brain
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.760]   and how your brain impacts your pursuit
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.400]   or your avoidance of sugar.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   Let's get a few things out of the way first.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.160]   The first thing is that there's nothing inherently bad
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.280]   about sugar.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.360]   I know the word sugar gets a bad rap nowadays.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.620]   And indeed, you're going to hear over and over again
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.300]   during this podcast that consuming a lot of refined sugars,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.620]   in particular high fructose corn syrup,
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.380]   is known to have a very large number of bad effects
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.300]   on the brain and body.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.460]   I don't know that there's anyone
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.640]   that really debates that anymore.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.420]   Even if we just agree, and I think we should all agree
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.560]   on the so-called calories in, calories out principle,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.340]   right, it's a principle of thermodynamics
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.400]   that if we ingest more energy than we burn,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.520]   we are going to gain weight.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.400]   If we ingest less energy than we burn,
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.120]   we are generally going to lose weight.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.360]   And if the two things are in balance,
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.340]   ingestion and burning of energy,
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.560]   well, then we're going to maintain weight.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.260]   So everyone agrees on that.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.140]   I agree on that.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.640]   But beyond that, there are a number of ways
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.140]   in which particular nutrients,
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.780]   in the case of today's episode, sugar,
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.420]   impact the way that the brain works,
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.360]   such that we tend to seek out more of particular nutrients.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.700]   For instance, if we eat sugar,
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.380]   there are two or at least two mechanisms
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.480]   by which we will crave more sugar.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.140]   I think most people are aware of that experience,
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.660]   but today I'm going to explain exactly how that works.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.560]   But also that when we ingest sugar,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.220]   it has a bunch of different effects
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.920]   on the way that our neural circuits work
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.540]   that can allow us to be more or less focused,
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.280]   more or less agitated, more or less happy,
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.720]   more or less depressed in some cases.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.300]   So today, as we explore this thing we're calling sugar,
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.880]   we're going to explore that mainly
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.020]   in the context of the nervous system,
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.540]   but also in the context of how the nervous system
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.260]   regulates many, many functions and behaviors
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.300]   that are important to all of you.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.420]   Your ability to think, your ability to exercise,
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.300]   your ability to gain weight, lose weight,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.620]   whatever your goals might happen to be,
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.820]   sugar plays a critical role in achieving those goals.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.420]   And in some cases, if you're ingesting too much
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.160]   at the wrong times or the wrong forms,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.580]   sugar can actually impede those goals.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   In fact, sugar can prevent all the right behaviors
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.420]   from allowing you to achieve the goals that you want.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.940]   So today we are going to place sugar
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.020]   into its proper context.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.100]   The way I want to start off by doing that
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.220]   is to tell you a little bit of what happens when we eat
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.800]   and a little bit of what the brain does
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.440]   to respond to those events.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.860]   So what happens when we eat?
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.460]   Well, I've done an entire episode on metabolism.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.660]   So if you're interested in the full cascade
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.820]   of hormonal and neural events that occurs when we eat,
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.360]   please check out that episode.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.020]   But for sake of today's discussion,
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.900]   let's just take a, what I call top contour view
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.100]   of the hormonal response to ingesting food.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.740]   Now, anytime we eat, that is the consequence
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.960]   of a number of things that happened before we ate.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.500]   There's a hormone in our brain and body called ghrelin,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.960]   spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.460]   Ghrelin is a hormone that increases depending
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.140]   on how long it's been since we ate last, okay?
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.720]   So the longer it's been since we had a meal,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.620]   ghrelin levels are going to be higher and higher and higher.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.540]   And it essentially makes us hungry by interacting
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.940]   with particular neurons in an area of the brain
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.380]   called the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.740]   and some other areas as well, like the lateral hypothalamus.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.380]   You don't need to know the names of those brain areas,
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.340]   but if you'd like to know them, there they are.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.700]   Ghrelin increases, it tends to make us hungry.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.460]   And then when we eat,
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.460]   typically what happens is ghrelin levels go down.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.220]   So it's a very logical system.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.180]   Now, when we eat, assuming that we eat carbohydrates,
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.960]   but even if we just eat some protein and some fats,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.460]   we will experience a slight, or in some cases,
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.020]   a large rise in blood glucose.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.660]   Blood glucose is simply blood sugar.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.660]   And the body and brain, we should say particular,
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.020]   the nervous system doesn't function well
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.260]   if blood sugar is too high or too low.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.320]   So as a consequence, we have another hormone,
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.660]   which is released from the pancreas,
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.820]   which is called insulin,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.620]   which helps regulate the amount of glucose
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.580]   in the bloodstream.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.860]   So even if you were to ingest an entire cup,
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.040]   an eight ounce cup of pure table sugar,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.660]   which would send your blood glucose very, very high,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.500]   assuming that you have a normal insulin response,
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.320]   that you're not diabetic,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.460]   that insulin response would help clamp
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.300]   that blood glucose level so that it did not cause damage
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.720]   to your brain and body.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.280]   Because if blood sugar goes too high,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.120]   it's actually toxic to neurons
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   and other cells of your body can kill them off.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.280]   And neurons of the central nervous system,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.400]   meaning the brain and spinal cord,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.300]   once they are dead, they do not come back.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.540]   So your biological systems understand this
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.260]   at a biological level, that is,
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.580]   and prevent that death of cells due to high blood sugar
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.500]   by keeping insulin around in order to clamp blood glucose.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.680]   Diabetics, we call them type one diabetics
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.820]   who don't make insulin,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.460]   have to take insulin when they eat,
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.620]   in particular, when they eat foods
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.940]   that raise their blood sugar,
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.940]   specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.420]   and the other deleterious effects of high blood sugar.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.340]   Okay, so ghrelin is a hormone that goes up
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.060]   the longer it's been since we've eaten.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.220]   It tends to stimulate hunger.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.640]   When we eat, ghrelin is suppressed.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.500]   Blood glucose typically goes up,
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.260]   especially when we eat a carbohydrate-containing meal.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.420]   When blood glucose goes up, it's regulated in the body,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.740]   meaning its peaks and its valleys
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.620]   are more or less smoothed out
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.400]   and that glucose is sequestered.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.980]   It's taken away where it needs to be taken away.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.360]   And in certain locations, it's delivered to cells
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.940]   so that those cells can use the glucose.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.200]   Now, one of the chief organs for glucose utilization
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.580]   is the brain.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.760]   Neurons are tremendously metabolically active
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.420]   and their preferred mode of metabolism
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.820]   is glucose metabolism.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.020]   In other words, neurons basically run on sugar,
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.640]   which is not to say that you should eat a lot of sugar.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.820]   As you'll see today, there are states of mind and body,
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.500]   for instance, fasted states,
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.540]   in which people report having immense amounts
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.860]   of mental clarity
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.340]   and their blood glucose is actually quite low.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.180]   So it is simply not the case
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.980]   that the more sugar that you ingest,
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.700]   the better that your brain will function.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.920]   But it is the case that for most people,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.820]   meaning people who are not on a ketogenic
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.320]   or very low carbohydrate diet,
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.460]   they're not adapted to low carbohydrate diets,
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.060]   that neurons in their brain and body
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.060]   are using glucose in order to function.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.300]   That's what allows those neurons
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.900]   to fire electrical potentials.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.520]   That's how we refer to it, firing,
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.060]   meaning sending electrical signals down their length
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.220]   to communicate with other neurons.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.440]   To illustrate just how important glucose is
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.900]   for brain function,
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.320]   I'd like to describe a study that just recently came out
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.100]   that sits on a long history of similar studies,
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.540]   but the one that just came out is particularly interesting.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.980]   Now, I want to point out that unless I say otherwise,
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.780]   I'm going to refer to typical diets,
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.640]   meaning I have to believe that most people out there
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.940]   are ingesting some starch or carbohydrate.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.100]   I do realize there are people
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.140]   following very low carbohydrate diets
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.660]   or moderately carbohydrate diets.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.940]   I even know that there's some folks out there
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.560]   who are on the so-called carnivore diet.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.540]   They only eat meat and organs, maybe a little fruit,
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.660]   but I'm going to assume that the vast majority
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:55.080]   of people listening ingest proteins and carbohydrates.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.780]   So unless I say ketogenic,
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.860]   or I emphasize ketosis itself, which I will,
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.420]   I'm referring to a kind of typical diet
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.520]   where people are consuming fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.660]   I count myself as one such individual.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.000]   At some point, I might try the carnivore diet, who knows?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.700]   I might try a pure vegan diet, who knows?
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.720]   But for my entire life up until now, I'm 46 years old,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.320]   I've been a proud omnivore, meaning I've tried
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.020]   to eat high quality, as much as I can, unprocessed foods.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.920]   I try and really avoid highly processed foods,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.200]   but I do eat from those three macronutrient groups,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.160]   proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.820]   And I'm going to assume that most of you do as well.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.420]   The study I'd like to emphasize,
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.840]   recorded from neurons, nerve cells in the brain,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.280]   in particular in the part of the brain
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.680]   that responds to visual images,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.180]   so-called visual cortex.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.300]   And neurons in the visual cortex are beautifully tuned,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.940]   as we say, to particular features of what we see.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.020]   The primary example of this, the kind of classic example,
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.580]   is if you put a little electrode next to a neuron
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.780]   in your visual cortex, or if we put you
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.040]   into an fMRI scanner machine,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.560]   which can detect neural activity,
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.900]   and I were to show you a bunch of just little lines,
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.760]   bars of light, they could be dark bars of light,
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.540]   they could be light bars of light
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.660]   on a screen in front of you.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.620]   So some would be vertical, some will be horizontal,
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.360]   some will be at 45 degrees.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.140]   What we would see is that some neurons respond best,
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.760]   meaning they fire a lot of electrical activity
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.700]   to vertical lines.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.760]   Other ones respond to horizontal lines,
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.620]   and others respond to 45 degree lines.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.220]   And this so-called orientation tuning,
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.060]   meaning because of the orientation of the line,
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.280]   is a cardinal classic feature of the way
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.140]   that your visual system is built.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.560]   And everything that you see,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.980]   whether it's a face or a dog or a cat or a landscape,
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.140]   is built up from these very simple neuron responses.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.580]   In other words, when you look at a face,
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.140]   there are neurons deep in the brain that respond to faces,
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.920]   but the only reason that those neurons
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.660]   can respond to those faces is because they receive signals
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.800]   from neurons in your visual cortex,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.460]   some of which respond to vertical lines,
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.100]   some of which respond to horizontal lines,
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.220]   and some of which respond to 45 degree lines,
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.000]   and all of those are built up
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   in what we call a hierarchical representation,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.160]   which is fancy language for it.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.680]   Those are the building blocks by which you see a face
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.660]   and you recognize a face.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.120]   And it's really an amazing phenomenon.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.740]   It happens very, very fast.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.420]   You never notice that you're doing this,
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.320]   but everything is built up
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.060]   from these fundamental orientation-tuned neurons.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.080]   Now, orientation-tuned neurons are so fundamental
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.820]   that they are the building blocks
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.900]   by which you make up all other things that you see.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.740]   It's the way you read,
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.040]   it's the way that you recognize faces, as I mentioned,
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.000]   and everything else.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.180]   Experimentally, it's quite straightforward
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.200]   to measure how sharply tuned one of these neurons is.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.280]   In other words, if I were to show you a vertical line
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.700]   and find a neuron in your brain
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.600]   that responds to vertical lines,
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.940]   I could also ask whether or not
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.500]   that neuron fires any electrical activity
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.120]   in response to a line that's not quite vertical,
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.140]   maybe just 10 degrees off vertical,
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.060]   or 20 degrees, or 30 degrees.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.680]   And what I eventually would find
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.980]   is that that neuron was orientation-tuned
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.060]   over a particular range of angles.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.240]   It's not only going to respond to vertical lines,
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.580]   it's also going to respond to lines
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.300]   that are about 10 degrees off vertical in either side,
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.220]   but probably not much more, maybe 20,
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.020]   but usually it's going to be anywhere from vertical
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.140]   to just tilted slightly, okay?
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.340]   In the recent experiment
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.800]   that was published in the journal Neuron,
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.880]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.180]   the authors asked a really interesting question.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.920]   They asked whether or not the sharpness of tuning,
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.940]   the precision of orientation tuning of these neurons
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.780]   is dependent on blood glucose level.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.080]   So just to cut to the chase, to give you the answer,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.200]   what they found is that when subjects are well-fed,
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.180]   neurons that responded to vertical
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.020]   responded very strongly to vertical,
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.840]   but not very much at all to other angles
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.760]   of what we call stimuli,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.120]   to lines that are 10 degrees or 20 degrees off.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.100]   If they looked at neurons that were primarily tuned,
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.280]   right, that preferred horizontal lines,
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.760]   they found the same thing, okay?
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.380]   So it wasn't something unique to vertical lines.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.660]   What they basically found was the sharpness,
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.500]   the precision of tuning of neurons in the brain
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.840]   was best when subjects were fed.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.880]   And conversely, when subjects were fasted,
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.580]   the orientation tuning of these neurons
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.620]   became much broader.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.020]   What it meant was that a neuron
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.980]   that normally would only respond to vertical
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.740]   now responded to other angles of lines as well.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.260]   You might say, well, that's great, right?
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.060]   These neurons that at one point could only do one thing
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.900]   are now tuned to other things, but it's not so great
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.580]   because what that means is that in the fasted state,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.480]   your perception of the outside world is actually distorted.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.320]   It's blurred.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.240]   It's not as precise as it is when you're fed.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.000]   And when I say fed, what I really mean
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.500]   is when glucose is available to neurons.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.380]   Now, for some of you, maybe many of you,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.340]   and including myself, intermittent fasting
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.180]   or some variant thereof is actually a state that I like.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.220]   It allows me to focus.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.920]   For instance, as I mentioned before,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.140]   and even earlier in this podcast,
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.660]   I tend to eat my first meal sometime around 11 a.m.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.180]   And then I generally eat my last meal sometime
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.580]   around 8 p.m., plus or minus an hour on either side.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.620]   I'm not super strict about it.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.980]   And occasionally I'll wake up really hungry
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.500]   and I'll eat something before 11 a.m.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.900]   I'm not super strict about this intermittent fasting thing.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.260]   It just seems to be how my appetite works best
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.700]   given my schedule, et cetera.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.900]   In the morning, I tend to be most focused.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.220]   And I always associate that with the fact that I was fasted.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.140]   I ingest water and some caffeine
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.580]   about 90 minutes after waking up.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.420]   I drink my caffeine,
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.780]   but I hydrate from the time I get up, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.740]   And I know a lot of other people
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.820]   have had the experience of being fasted
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.460]   and feeling like they have a lot of mental clarity.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.300]   When you are in a fasted state,
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.980]   typically you're going to use fuels
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.820]   that are available to the neurons
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.900]   based on your intake of food the day before.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.700]   Maybe you're using some glycogen.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.280]   Maybe you're using some fat.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.220]   Maybe you're using some blood sugar
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.100]   that's derived from other storage sites in the body.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.580]   You don't actually use fat
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.500]   as a fuel source for neurons under typical conditions,
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.800]   but there are ways in which proteins and fats
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.220]   and glycogen, et cetera,
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.140]   are converted into fuel that neurons can use.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.660]   What's interesting about this study
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.240]   is that the study says that when well-fed,
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.820]   meaning when blood glucose, sugar,
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.460]   is at a properly elevated level in the bloodstream,
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.160]   it can be delivered to the brain
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.100]   in a way that allows neurons to work best,
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.880]   which is really all just to underscore
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.920]   the point that I made earlier,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.300]   which is that your nervous system
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.220]   is extremely metabolically demanding,
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.880]   and it loves glucose.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.100]   Neurons love glucose.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.000]   So the takeaway from this study
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.980]   is not that you should avoid fasting.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.920]   The takeaway from this study
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.320]   is that there are elements of the fasted state,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.540]   in particular the elevations
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.420]   in things like epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.640]   also called adrenaline and noradrenaline,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.180]   that can give us this kind of clarity of mind
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.520]   that many people are pursuing when they fast.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.380]   That's kind of one of the reasons a lot of people fast.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.500]   They like the way that they feel mentally and physically.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.480]   But I think it's only fair to point out
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.380]   that glucose is the preferred source of fuel for the brain.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.180]   And this study that I mentioned
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.220]   is one of many studies that have explored
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.820]   how nutritional status or blood glucose status
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.640]   in the brain and body influence neuronal tuning
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.260]   and neuronal function.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.900]   And it really points to the fact that ultimately,
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.020]   your brain as an organ is a glucose-consuming machine.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.020]   Now, when you eat a food, that food is broken down,
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.660]   and if it contains carbohydrates,
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.420]   it's going to be converted into glucose.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.620]   And that glucose can't get directly into the brain
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.460]   as a fuel source.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.780]   It actually has to be carried across
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.660]   the so-called blood-brain barrier, the BBB.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.060]   And the actual metabolism of glucose
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.380]   and the delivery of the glucose to the neurons
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.340]   is carried out by a different cell type.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.100]   And it's a cell type that you should all know about
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.340]   because it's the most abundant cell type in your brain
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.140]   and maybe even in your entire nervous system.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.180]   And that's the so-called astrocyte.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.360]   Astrocytes are one of several types of glia.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.080]   The word glia means glue,
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.580]   but many people have taken that name, glia, glue,
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.140]   to think that, oh, the only thing
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.020]   that the astrocytes are doing
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.460]   is just kind of holding things together.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.100]   Actually, the astrocytes are involved
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.660]   in delivering glucose to the neurons.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.700]   They are critically involved in shaping
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.940]   your neuronal function and brain plasticity,
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.140]   the brain's ability to change in response to experience.
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.060]   So these astrocytes are like the little waiters
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.940]   and waitresses bringing glucose to the neurons.
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.540]   And the neurons are going to do the heavy lifting
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.420]   that's involved in perception and behavior and action.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.580]   So if prior to this episode,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.780]   you didn't already realize that glucose, blood sugar,
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.500]   is vital to the function of your brain
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.900]   and other neurons of your nervous system, now you know.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.620]   And for those of you that have experienced
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.140]   the increase in mental clarity
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.140]   that comes after a properly timed, properly composed,
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.820]   meaning it has the right macronutrients
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.700]   and the right ratios and the properly sized meal,
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.420]   well, then now you have justification for eating something
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.220]   as a way to improve the way that your brain works.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.020]   It turns out that your brain is going to work best
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.820]   when it's got glucose available.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.300]   Whether you like to fast or not,
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.820]   that's just the reality of things.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.360]   The same thing is also true for the neurons in your body.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.740]   The way that you are able to move the limbs of your body,
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.620]   the way that you are able to perform exercise
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.760]   or movement of any kind for that matter,
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.380]   is because neurons called motor neurons
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.180]   send electrical potentials to the muscle fibers.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.540]   They release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine,
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.460]   which causes contraction of the muscle fibers
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.700]   and allows you to move your limbs.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.540]   Those neurons are also very metabolically demanding,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.140]   especially when you're doing
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.820]   demanding types of physical work.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.540]   And that could be cycling or running or weightlifting
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.900]   or yoga or whatever it may be.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.400]   Those neurons require a ton of glucose.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.700]   If you've ever had the experience
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.620]   of having to think very hard
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.340]   about how you're generating a movement
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.420]   or force yourself to continue to endure in a given exercise,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.900]   you might've thought, oh, you know, I'm running out of fuel.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.980]   That's why I'm getting tired.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.280]   It's hard to do.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.420]   That's actually the case sometimes,
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.060]   but that's not always the case.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.280]   One of the reasons that it feels like work
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.320]   is because your so-called upper motor neurons,
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.060]   the one that control the lower motor neurons
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.160]   in your spinal cord, which control your muscles,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.080]   they have to be very metabolically active.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.140]   It's one thing to engage in a reflexive movement
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.180]   where you're just walking around
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.780]   or if you're running continuously,
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.940]   but when you suddenly have to focus on what you're doing
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.860]   and you have to generate specific patterns of motor movement,
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.380]   well, that feels demanding because one,
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.100]   it increases the release of adrenaline
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:34.940]   in your brain and body,
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.140]   which makes you feel a little bit agitated and more alert,
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.140]   but also deliberate thought,
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.720]   deliberately controlling the way
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.900]   that your brain and body is moving
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.780]   requires more glucose uptake,
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.960]   more energy in those very neurons.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.660]   And this is also why after doing a long bout of exercise,
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.500]   you might be tired,
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.720]   but also if you do a bout of skill learning of any kind,
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.260]   or if you've been reading and thinking
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.580]   about what you're reading,
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.420]   or if you had a intense conversation with somebody
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.940]   where you're really forcing yourself to listen,
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.420]   and hopefully they're listening to you too,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.060]   and you're really trying to parse what they're saying,
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.300]   and maybe you're doing that right now
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.180]   and you're trying to really track something, that's work.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.620]   And that work requires glucose uptake by neurons,
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.580]   both in the brain and in your body.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.060]   Now that we've established that glucose
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.500]   is the preferred source of fuel for the nervous system,
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.100]   I'd like to concentrate on a few of the other types of sugars
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.220]   that we ingest on a common basis,
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.860]   and the impact that those have on brain function
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.000]   and body function.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.740]   I'd particularly like to focus on fructose.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.340]   Fructose, of course, is found in fruit.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.420]   It's also found in the infamous high fructose corn syrup,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.580]   which we will talk about today.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.980]   It's worth pointing out that the concentrations of fructose
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.260]   in fruit is quite low compared to the concentrations
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.320]   of fructose in high fructose corn syrup.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.080]   High fructose corn syrup is approximately 50% fructose,
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.820]   which turns out to be an enormously high percentage
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.040]   of anything really, especially when we contrast that
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.560]   to the concentrations of fructose in fruit.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.060]   Fruits have other types of sugars in them as well.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.060]   The sucrose content of most fruit and fruit juices is low,
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.900]   although there are some fruits like melons, peaches,
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.540]   pineapples, and so forth, that contain a little less
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.060]   than 10% or so of sucrose.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.500]   Things like mangoes can have a lot of sucrose,
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.340]   but typically the amount of fructose, fructose,
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.980]   I think is the proper pronunciation
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.920]   that people are always correcting me, fructose,
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   is anywhere from 1% to about 10%, right?
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.420]   It's really going to vary quite a bit.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.740]   And many of you have probably heard
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.280]   of the so-called glycemic index,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.100]   which is basically a measure of how fast blood sugar rises
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.400]   after eating particular foods, et cetera.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.560]   We're going to set aside the glycemic index for now.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.920]   We will come back to it.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.260]   It has some relationship to the concentrations
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.780]   of fructose in fruit.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.020]   But the point that I'd like to make is that fructose
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.100]   as a sugar is handled very differently in the body
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.980]   than is glucose.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:07.540]   But I also want to emphasize that because the percentage
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.960]   of fructose in fruit is rather low,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.180]   especially compared to high fructose corn syrup.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.040]   Many people have demonized fructose saying
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.700]   that fructose makes you fat or that fruit makes you fat.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.560]   If you look at the data, that's not really the case.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.300]   The fact of the matter is that the concentrations
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.140]   of fructose and fruit are so low
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.420]   that unless someone is consuming a lot of fruit
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.460]   or they're consuming a lot of fruit on the backdrop
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.900]   of a highly processed diet or a diet that has a lot
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.220]   of other stuff that they might not want to be ingesting,
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.260]   you can't really say that fructose is fattening.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.340]   I don't really think that there's any basis
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.380]   for saying that fructose itself is bad.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.460]   Now, high fructose corn syrup is a different issue
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.820]   and too much consumption of anything but fructose included,
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.540]   whether or not it comes from fruit or otherwise,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.340]   can be a problem for the ways that it impacts
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.500]   the neural circuits that process sugar,
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.280]   not just glucose, but fructose.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.300]   And so we'll illustrate those neural circuits in a bit
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.760]   and it will become very clear to all of you,
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.300]   regardless of whether or not you have a background
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.300]   in biology or metabolism, nutrition or otherwise,
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.320]   why ingesting very high concentrations of fructose
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.860]   is not going to be a good thing
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.660]   for the way that your brain functions.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.580]   One of the key distinctions between glucose and fructose
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.360]   is that fructose most likely cannot directly access
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.420]   the brain, it actually needs to be converted
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.540]   into glucose in the liver.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.360]   And the way that conversion occurs feeds back
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   to a set of hormones and neural pathways
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.800]   that we talked about earlier,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.500]   which have a lot to do with appetite.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.640]   And to just summarize what is now a lot of very solid data,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.780]   fructose and specifically fructose has the ability
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.620]   to reduce certain hormones and peptides in our body
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.860]   whose main job is to suppress ghrelin.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.180]   As you recall, ghrelin is a hormone that increases
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.180]   the longer it's been since we've eaten
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.360]   and ghrelin makes us hungry by stimulating
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.080]   particular neurons in our hypothalamus.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.220]   It actually makes us really want to eat
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.600]   and in particular really makes us want to eat
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.580]   sugary and fatty foods.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.740]   Fructose reduces the activity of the hormones
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.540]   that reduce ghrelin.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.300]   And so the net consequence of that
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.700]   is that fructose increases ghrelin.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.300]   So although I, and I think pretty much everyone out there,
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.740]   say for a few individuals agrees that calories in,
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.400]   calories out is the fundamental principle
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.120]   of weight loss, weight maintenance or weight gain,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.160]   ingesting fructose shifts our hormone system.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.860]   And as a consequence, our neural pathways within our brain,
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.120]   the hypothalamus to be hungrier,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.500]   regardless of how many calories we've eaten, okay?
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.200]   Now I also want to be absolutely clear.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.340]   This does not mean that eating an apple or eating a melon
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.660]   or eating a couple of apricots or something
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.940]   is going to make you hyperphagic,
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.980]   meaning it's going to make you just want to eat and eat.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.240]   That's simply not the case.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.840]   But if you compare fructose and you compare glucose,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.860]   not only are they metabolized differently
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.900]   in the brain and body, but in addition to that,
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.600]   fructose has this impact of reducing the hormones
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.960]   that reduce hunger hormones and neural circuits.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.700]   And so fructose does have this kind of twist
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.560]   in its phenotype, right?
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.000]   Or it's, I guess if fructose had a dating profile,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.240]   this would be a kind of a red flag in that profile.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.700]   Because fructose itself,
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.060]   while it's actually a pretty good fuel source in many ways,
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.160]   and it's often packaged in things like fruits,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.460]   which bring along fiber and vitamins and minerals
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.000]   that I think for many of us are things
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.280]   that we should be eating more of and ingesting more of,
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.920]   it can suppress the pathways that suppress hunger.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.720]   And as a consequence, it can increase hunger.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.960]   So current recommendations for most people
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.760]   are to eat more fruits and vegetables.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.200]   But for those of you that are trying to control your hunger,
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.580]   ingesting a lot of fructose
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.140]   is probably not going to be a good idea.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.800]   Certainly ingesting it from high fructose corn syrup
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.760]   is not going to be a good idea
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.580]   because of the enormous percentages of fructose
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.700]   in high fructose corn syrup, 50% or sometimes even more.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.080]   But even from fruit, some people will find
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.880]   that fruit really quenches their appetite.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.760]   Other people will find that fruit stimulates their appetite.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.680]   And I suppose if you're trying to stimulate your appetite,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.960]   then ingesting more fruit might actually
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   be advantageous to you.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.340]   So fructose provides a bridge for us
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.600]   between a particular kind of sugar, hormone function,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.560]   in this case, ghrelin and the hypothalamus,
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.000]   which leads us to the next question,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.800]   which is what is it about sugar
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.020]   that makes it such an attractive thing for us?
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.800]   Why do we like it so much?
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.960]   And the obvious answer that most people arrive at is,
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.540]   well, it just tastes really, really good,
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.800]   but that's actually not the way it works.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.680]   The rewarding properties, as we say, of sugar,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.860]   whether or not they come in the form of sucrose or fructose
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.660]   or foods that increase glucose to a very high level,
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.020]   actually is not just related to the taste of the foods
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.080]   that produce that elevation in glucose, sucrose, or fructose.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.340]   It is in part, but that's only part of the story.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.340]   And the rest of the story, once you understand it,
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.800]   can actually place you in a position to much better control
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.380]   your sugar intake of all kinds,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.600]   but also your food intake in ways that can allow you
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.360]   to make much better choices about the foods you ingest.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.400]   And actually at this point,
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.720]   I should probably give a confession.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.800]   I've said today, and I'll say it again,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.240]   and I've said it on previous podcasts,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.760]   I don't have much of a sweet tooth and indeed that's true.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.400]   And I can kind of pass on chocolate or ice cream
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.240]   or things like that.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.060]   It seems like with each successive year,
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.800]   sweet things are less and less appealing to me.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.660]   Of course, savory foods,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.520]   anything that is really fatty, salty, savory,
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.700]   those don't last long in my presence.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   But I always say I don't really like sweet things so much.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.160]   And I don't, I like sweet people,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.280]   but I don't tend to like sweet foods, which is true,
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.440]   but there's probably one exception and that's mangoes.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.640]   And it turns out that mangoes have the highest percentage
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.460]   of sugar in them, in particular fructose,
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.560]   as well as other forms of sugars.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.600]   So what I do, because I love mangoes so much,
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.400]   is I will have mangoes probably twice a week,
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.640]   but I'll have them after some sort of resistance training
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.400]   or hard run or something like that.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.240]   Because it is the case that after you exercise hard,
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.980]   in particular exercise that is of the high intensity variety
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.920]   that your body is more efficient
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.740]   at using circulating blood sugar.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.760]   It's able to store that or use that for fuel.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.620]   And so what I'll typically do is just take the mango,
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.960]   actually eat the peels too.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.460]   I know that probably some people are going to cringe
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.300]   when they hear that.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.140]   I find them delicious.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.520]   So I just bite into those things like apples.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.320]   I don't eat the pits, however.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.340]   So now I want to take us on a journey
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.240]   into the nervous system to explain the pathways
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.460]   in the brain and body that regulate our appetite for sugar.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.000]   Now, keep in mind what I already told you before,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.600]   which is that when we ingest foods,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.420]   they're broken down into various components
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.020]   and glucose is going to be shuttled to the brain.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.040]   And of course, to other neurons in our spinal cord
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.720]   and elsewhere and to our muscles, et cetera,
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.260]   in order for all of those cells and organs and tissues
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.400]   to be able to function.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.980]   The fact that so many cells and organs and tissues
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.420]   require glucose in order to function
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.100]   has led to a situation where you have dedicated
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.460]   neural machinery, pieces of your brain
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.840]   that are almost entirely, if not entirely devoted
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.700]   to seeking out of sugar or foods that contain sugars
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.300]   and to make sure that you not only seek those out,
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.080]   but you know where those foods are
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.620]   and that you ingest more and more and more of them.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.900]   And there are two main ways that these neural circuits work.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.940]   In fact, we can say that there are two neural circuits
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.100]   entirely that work in parallel.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.340]   And this is a common theme throughout the nervous system
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.100]   and that's parallel pathways.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.760]   Parallel pathways are the ways
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.740]   that you can distinguish light from dark.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.820]   Parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.620]   high-pitched sounds from low-pitched sounds.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.660]   Parallel pathways are the ways that you can
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.220]   flex your muscles versus extend your muscles.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.300]   For instance, if you move your wrist
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.300]   closer to your shoulder, you're flexing your bicep
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.620]   and you're actually inhibiting,
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.340]   you're actually preventing the action of your tricep.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.560]   If you move your wrist away from your shoulder,
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.500]   you are essentially using your extensor, your tricep,
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.740]   and you're inhibiting the activity of your bicep.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.940]   So for every function in your body
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.420]   that you might think is controlled by one brain area
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.060]   or one neural circuit, almost always,
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.620]   there are two or more so-called parallel pathways
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.900]   that ensure that that particular behavior happens.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.020]   Now, in the case of sugar consumption,
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.060]   the two parallel pathways involve one pathway
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.420]   related to the actual taste and the perception
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.280]   of sweet tastes that lead not just you,
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.580]   but every animal that we're aware of
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.160]   to seek more sweet-containing foods.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.660]   The other parallel pathway is related
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.820]   to the nutritive component of sweet foods,
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.620]   meaning the degree to which a given food
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.540]   will raise blood glucose.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.700]   I want to repeat that.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.580]   One pathway in your brain and body is devoted
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.460]   to getting you to seek out sweet-tasting things
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.300]   that you perceive as sweet.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.620]   And another parallel pathway is devoted
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.860]   to getting you to seek out foods
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.160]   that lead to increases in blood glucose.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.940]   It just so happens that the foods
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.660]   that lead to big increases in blood glucose
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.840]   typically are associated with that sweet taste.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.980]   Now this is distinctly different than the neural pathways
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.620]   that control seeking of savory foods or salty foods
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.180]   or spicy foods for that matter, or bitter foods.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.800]   The sweet pathway is what we would call hardwired.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.060]   It exists, as far as we know,
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.460]   in every mammal that even exists in fruit flies,
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.040]   hence fruit fly.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.220]   Basically getting sweet stuff into the body
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.380]   might seem like it has a lot to do with the taste,
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.780]   but it has just as much to do
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.860]   with the nutritive components
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.940]   that sweet-tasting foods carry
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.840]   and the fact that your nervous system
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.180]   and so many cells in your brain and body run on glucose.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.520]   If you recall earlier, I said, even if you ingest fructose,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.840]   fructose can be converted into glucose in the liver.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.740]   And I mentioned, of course,
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.700]   that fructose may actually work directly on the brain.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.460]   That's still unclear for humans.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.620]   The jury's still out on that.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.880]   We will see.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.920]   But the fundamental thing to understand here
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.420]   is that when you think you want a piece of chocolate
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.120]   or you think you want a piece of cake
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.780]   or you're craving something sweet,
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.620]   you are both craving the taste
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.700]   and your neurons are literally craving
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.420]   the nutritive components that arrive with that taste.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.160]   And simply by understanding that
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.940]   can allow you to circumvent some of the sugar cravings
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.500]   that you might otherwise be a complete hopeless victim to.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.560]   Also in this episode, I will talk about ways
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.220]   that you can sort of undermine or short circuit,
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.560]   these circuits, if you will,
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.640]   in order to reduce sugar cravings on a regular basis
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.340]   if that's your goal.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.040]   Two parallel pathways.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.280]   One of the parallel pathways
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.060]   has to do with conscious perception.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.540]   So animals of all kinds, mice, rats, and humans
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.700]   will prefer sugary tastes to non-sugary tastes.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.220]   When we eat something that tastes sweet,
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.840]   we register that sweet taste by way of sweet receptors,
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.860]   literally little ports or portals of neurons
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.140]   on our tongue and on our palate.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   A lot of people don't realize this,
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.260]   but there are a lot of taste receptors on the soft palate
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.660]   and around the mouth, so on the sides of the mouth.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.780]   So you're actually tasting things, not just with your tongue
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.820]   but with your entire mouth and your palate.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.340]   So when you ingest something sweet,
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.980]   very quickly there are signals sent
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.860]   from those neurons in your mouth
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.260]   to brain areas that cause you to seek out
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.220]   or at least pay attention to the source
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.780]   and the abundance of those sweet things.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.400]   They literally change your perception.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.940]   In fact, there are beautiful neuroimaging studies
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.960]   that show that when people ingest a sugary drink,
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.220]   their perception of images of foods change very much
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.780]   to make those foods appear more appetizing
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.300]   and not just foods that contain sugar.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.020]   Results of those studies do show
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.420]   that there's an increase, for instance,
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.380]   in the perception of detail and images of ice cream
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.940]   after you ingest a sweet drink
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.180]   or even put like a hard candy into your mouth.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.220]   It will make you seek out sugary things more.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.160]   It will make sugary things look more appetizing,
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.900]   but also other foods more appetizing.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.020]   So I think it's important that people recognize that fact
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.700]   that when you have a sweet taste in your mouth
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.860]   or when you've tasted something sweet within your mouth,
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.800]   I should say, your perception of food
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.700]   has immediately shifted.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.540]   These are fast neural pathways,
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.000]   then we'll get into some of the brain structures
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.460]   in a moment, but these are fast neural pathways
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:10.460]   that shift your entire self toward seeking more sugary stuff
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.740]   and more food generally.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.180]   Now, does that mean that you should
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.860]   never ingest anything sweet?
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.660]   No, certainly I'm not saying that.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.020]   Everyone has to decide for themselves
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.100]   what the appropriate amount of sugar intake is,
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.820]   but I find it remarkable when people say,
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.900]   "Oh, you know, I need to get my sugar fix,"
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.660]   or, "I need to have my chocolate,"
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.940]   or, "I need to have a little bit of something
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.620]   to just kind of take care of that sugar appetite,"
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.240]   because in taking care of that sugar appetite,
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.700]   maybe for the very disciplined of you,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.300]   you can just have that one piece of chocolate
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.140]   and it's great and you can relish in it,
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.500]   but it does shift the way
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   that you perceive other foods as well.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.420]   And the way it does that is through our,
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.380]   probably if you're a listener to this podcast now,
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.840]   old friend, but incredible neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.700]   Dopamine is a molecule that is released
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.740]   from several places in the brain.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.000]   There's a so-called mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.500]   which is a whole set of places in the brain or circuits
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.200]   designed to get us motivated and craving
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.780]   and in pursuit of things.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.620]   And then of course, there are areas of the brain
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.540]   that are involved in movement that are linked up
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.620]   with those areas involved in motivation.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:14.440]   That makes perfect sense.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.220]   Why would you have a brain area involved in motivation
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.060]   if you couldn't actually do something with that motivation?
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.980]   So the way that your brain is designed
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.920]   is when there's an increase in dopamine
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.380]   in the mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.300]   there are signals sent to an area of the brain
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.140]   called the striatum.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.540]   We're going to spend a little bit of time today
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.420]   in the striatum.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.580]   It's got a dorsal part, meaning an upper part
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.820]   and a ventral part, which means a lower part.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.180]   And the dopamine sent to those areas
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:41.180]   places us into modes of action to pursue particular things.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.980]   Sugar or sweet tastes, I should say to be more specific,
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.580]   have an incredibly potent ability
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.420]   to activate dopamine release
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.580]   within the mesolimbic reward pathway.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.220]   This has been shown over and over and over again.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.160]   In animal models and in humans.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.460]   This is especially true, I should mention,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.700]   through the ingestion of sweet liquids.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.940]   Now, this becomes a very important point to us
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.740]   a little later on when we talk about the proliferation
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.300]   of sodas and sweet drinks,
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.460]   and dare I even say non-sugar or diet sodas.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.320]   We're going to get into that a little bit later,
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.060]   perhaps one of the most third rail topics in nutrition.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.500]   But when we ingest something sweet,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.340]   the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.220]   and the mesolimbic reward pathways,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.580]   which then are conveyed to pathways for motor behavior.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.660]   And in general, place us into modes of focused action
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.880]   toward getting more of whatever was sweet.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.020]   Again, for those of you that are very disciplined,
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.740]   you can probably eat that one piece of chocolate
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.420]   and be just fine.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.720]   But if you understand the way that dopamine works,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.900]   what you'll realize is that when this dopamine pathway
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.320]   is triggered, it tends to create not the sensation
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.300]   or the perception of satiety,
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.140]   of feeling like something is enough,
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:07.340]   but rather to produce the sensation of wanting more.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.340]   As described in the episode that I hosted
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.420]   with my phenomenal colleague
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.060]   from Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lemke,
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.620]   she's an expert on addiction and dopamine pathways.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.220]   The dopamine circuits of the brain
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.460]   have what we call a pleasure pain balance.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.640]   And there I'm paraphrasing what Dr. Anna Lemke has said
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.440]   and has written about in her beautiful book,
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.280]   "Dopamine Nation."
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.360]   If you haven't read that book, I highly recommend it.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.700]   Whether or not you have issues with addiction
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.140]   or you know people that do or you don't,
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.120]   it's an incredibly important read,
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.060]   especially if you're interested
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.960]   in understanding motivated behaviors
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.940]   and ways to channel your behaviors in life
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.880]   toward healthy motivated behaviors
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.740]   and make sure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.880]   that people fall into, not just addiction,
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.220]   but things like overuse of social media
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:00.100]   or wasting time in general, it's a phenomenal book.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.280]   In that book and of course, within research articles,
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:08.300]   you will find evidence of this so-called pleasure pain
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.400]   balance that exists within our dopamine circuits.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.300]   Nobody has dopamine circuits that allow them to escape
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.580]   this pleasure pain balance.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.380]   And the way this works is that any time
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.020]   that we engage in a behavior or we ingest something
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.220]   that increases our levels of dopamine,
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.780]   there is a subsequent increase in the neural circuits
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.740]   that control our sense of frustration, pain and lack.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.780]   And you can actually notice this phenomenon.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.440]   If for instance, you're somebody who really likes chocolate
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.460]   or you really like something else,
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.140]   pay attention to the way that you experience indulging
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:45.980]   in that thing.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.260]   If you eat that piece of chocolate
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.400]   and you really focus on savoring its amazing taste,
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   you'll notice that it provides some quenching of your desire
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.540]   for let's say sweet stuff or chocolate or both.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.200]   But right as you stop experiencing that,
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.420]   right as that chocolate intake tapers off,
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.900]   as you swallow it down your throat
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.700]   or you just pause for a second afterwards,
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.540]   what you'll notice is that your brain and body
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.980]   actually orient toward wanting more.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.300]   And that wanting of more is really the action
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.340]   of the neural circuits that underlie pain
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.860]   and are pushing your dopamine levels back down.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.900]   And when these circuits go awry, or I should say,
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:34.940]   when people fail to control themselves
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.460]   within the context of that pleasure pain balance,
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.340]   the typical behavior is to reach for yet another chocolate
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.660]   or to then look for something that will quench that desire
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.400]   and get dopamine levels back up.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.140]   Now, the way these pleasure pain circuits work
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.080]   is very diabolical because it turns out
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.740]   that were you to take another piece of chocolate,
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.720]   yes, your dopamine levels would go back up,
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.480]   but not to the same extent
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.660]   that they did the first bite of chocolate that you had.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.800]   In fact, we can say that the longer it's been
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.140]   since you've indulged in something that you really enjoy
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:10.840]   or would like, the greater the dopamine you will experience
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.480]   when you finally engage in that behavior
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.180]   or indulge that thing, ingest that thing.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.980]   And the greater the dopamine increase,
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.420]   the greater the subsequent action of those pain circuits.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.520]   So this puts you on a very complicated seesaw.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.540]   It's a very wobbly precarious state to be in,
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.380]   which is not to say you shouldn't have a piece of chocolate.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:35.220]   It's just to say that the sweet taste of sweet things,
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.240]   in particular things that we crave very much
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.260]   and we wait and wait and wait,
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.200]   and then we allow ourselves to indulge,
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.560]   those trigger changes in our neurochemistry
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.260]   and our neural circuits that place us
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.680]   in a very vulnerable place
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.180]   to either want more and more of that thing
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:55.180]   or to seek out other ways to fill that kind of emptiness
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.800]   that we feel or that gap like, oh, I would love more,
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.600]   but I'm not going to allow myself more.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.080]   Now, again, I'm not saying
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.000]   that you shouldn't pursue pleasurable things.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.480]   I mean, this molecule dopamine exists for a reason.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.840]   It's the, frankly, because of its involvement
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.240]   in sex and reproduction,
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.000]   it's the reason we're all here in the first place
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.120]   because last time I checked,
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.640]   the only way any of us got here was one way or another,
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.120]   sperm met egg and there was conception.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.860]   I still believe there are no exceptions to that
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.120]   that I'm aware of anyways.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.980]   That is a process where I should say
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.540]   the events leading up to that process
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.520]   typically involve dopamine in one way or another.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.140]   There are exceptions to that too, but you get the idea.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.840]   These dopamine pathways are not evil, they're not bad,
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.400]   but once you understand the way they work,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.200]   you can leverage them to your advantage
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.600]   as opposed to them leveraging you to their advantage.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.000]   Okay, so when you ingest something sweet,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.720]   you perceive that sweet taste
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.220]   and a cascade ensues within your brain
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.840]   that makes you want more of the sweet thing.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   That's the conscious pathway for sugar perception,
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.580]   for sweet perception.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.180]   Now there's the second pathway.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.680]   The second pathway is what's called
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.300]   the post-ingestive reinforcing properties of sugar,
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.380]   which is really just a fancy nerd speak way of saying
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.900]   there are events that happen within your stomach
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.160]   and below your conscious detection
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.020]   that are also driving you to seek out sweet tasting things
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.140]   independent of their taste
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.240]   and foods that increase blood glucose
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.940]   independent of their taste.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.620]   In order to illustrate the immense power
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.580]   of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking,
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.160]   I'd like to describe an experiment.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.460]   And this is just one experiment of many,
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.100]   of dozens or more experiments done in animal models
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.140]   and humans, which essentially illustrate the same thing.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.780]   And as I described this experiment,
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.980]   I think you will come to understand
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.620]   the power of these circuits.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:47.980]   I'll provide a link to this study in the caption.
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.860]   The first author is Freeman.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.820]   The paper was published in Frontiers in Bioscience,
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.300]   but there have been others papers in Nature Neuroscience,
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.280]   papers in Neuron, Cell Press Journals, et cetera,
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.220]   many, many journals, many, many papers.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:04.440]   If subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.900]   or a sweet tasting fluid,
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.980]   their preference for the sweet tasting fluid
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.540]   is much, much higher, right?
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.040]   Sweet things taste better than plain water,
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.540]   at least for most people and certainly for animals.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.460]   Now, if for instance, you take an animal
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.340]   which completely lacks sweet receptors,
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.720]   and you can do this through some molecular genetic tools
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.280]   and gymnastics.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.080]   In the laboratory, we call these knockout mice
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.640]   where you can knock out a particular receptor
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.480]   for sweet taste.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.340]   You can confirm that there's no perception of sweet things
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.740]   or at least no preference for sweet things
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:40.580]   in those animals.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.800]   In humans, you can numb the mouth.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.100]   There are other pharmacological ways
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.700]   that you can eliminate sweet receptors in the mouth.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.980]   And by doing that, people will tell you,
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.500]   no, I can't taste anything sweet.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.000]   It's just, you could give them a ice cream.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.340]   You could give them pure sucrose.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.600]   You give them table sugar,
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.980]   and they wouldn't be able to perceive it as sweet.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.460]   If you eliminate the perception of sweet taste in the mouth
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:05.280]   and you offer people or laboratory animals
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.440]   water versus some sugar containing solution,
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.420]   you eliminate the preference for the sugary solution,
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.480]   which tells us that the perception of sweet
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.380]   is important for the preference for sweet tasting drink.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.620]   This is also true for sweet tasting foods,
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.140]   I should mention.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:27.020]   However, in both animal models and in humans,
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.880]   after about 15 minutes,
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:34.140]   subjects start preferring the sugary water,
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:37.620]   even though they can't taste that it is sweeter.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.100]   So to repeat that,
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.700]   if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet,
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:44.360]   to perceive sweetness in foods,
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.180]   then you eliminate the preference for sweet beverages
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.500]   or sweet foods.
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.480]   So that's not surprising.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.460]   But if you wait about 15 minutes,
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.300]   the preference for the sweet beverage or the sweet food
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.260]   comes back.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.120]   Now that doesn't mean that they can perceive the sweetness.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.920]   In fact, the way these experiments are done is very clever.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.940]   You offer people various cups of different things
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.000]   or different food items,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.640]   and then you just look at what they eat more of
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.080]   or what they prefer to eat more of.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:13.060]   So this experiment is so crucial because what it says
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.960]   is that the preference for sugar containing foods
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.960]   is in part due to the sweetness of those foods,
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.420]   but in part due to something else.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.000]   And this something else is what we call
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.100]   the post-ingestive effect.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.160]   And as I mentioned before, it took about 15 minutes.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.800]   And you've actually experienced this.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.220]   Whether you realize it or not,
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:35.420]   this phenomenon of post-ingestive rewarding properties
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:39.140]   of sweet foods, meaning what happens in your body
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.700]   when you ingest something that increases
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.420]   your blood glucose very much,
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:46.580]   has no doubt controlled you from the inside
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.220]   below your awareness.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:51.240]   This was happening to you and you didn't realize it.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.300]   And here's how it works.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.860]   We all have neurons within our gut.
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.900]   These neurons have a name, they are called neuropod cells.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:01.180]   Neuropod cells were famously discovered
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:05.940]   by professor Dr. Diego Bajorquez at Duke University.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.860]   And these cells respond to, among other things,
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.760]   to the presence of sugar within the gut.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.120]   So when we ingest a sugary food or drink,
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.560]   or we ingest a food or drink that simply contains
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.300]   fructose, sucrose, glucose, or some other form of sugar
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.380]   that later, through metabolism,
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.160]   will be converted into glucose,
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.660]   the neuropod cells are able to register the presence
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:37.220]   of those sweet or glucose stimulating foods.
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.220]   And in response to that, send electrical signals,
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.540]   because electrical signals are the way neurons communicate,
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.540]   up to the brain via the so-called vagus nerve.
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.700]   The vagus nerve, of course, being a nerve pathway
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.620]   famous for its role in relaxation.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.040]   That's kind of the assumption out there
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.400]   that it's always involved in relaxation.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.320]   That's not the case.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.780]   It's involved in a lot of things besides relaxation.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.060]   But nonetheless, these neuropod cells
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.700]   send electrical signals through a particular highway
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.740]   within the vagus to the so-called nodose ganglion.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:07.760]   This is a cluster.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.660]   A ganglion is just a cluster of neurons.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.860]   And then the nodose ganglion sends on information
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:16.060]   to the nucleus of the solitary tract.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:18.420]   The nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.620]   that we're going to talk about extensively today.
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.940]   It's very important for understanding sugar preference.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.840]   These neuropod cells also trigger activation
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:33.280]   of dopamine pathways within the mesolimbic reward pathway.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.880]   In other words, there are signals conveyed from the gut,
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.760]   meaning stomach and intestines, to the brain
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.680]   anytime we ingest sweet foods,
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.200]   but it has nothing to do with our perception
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.040]   of them being sweet.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.640]   It has everything to do with the fact
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.700]   that sweetness of food is almost always correlated
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:54.180]   with an ability to increase blood glucose.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.140]   And the net effect of this is a parallel pathway
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.200]   by which dopamine is increased further.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.300]   Now, the experiment that I described before
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.500]   of animals or humans ingesting something
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.660]   that contains sugar,
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.900]   but not being able to perceive its sweetness,
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:14.060]   and yet after a period of time,
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:18.160]   still preferring that food or drink to non sugar containing
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.280]   food or drinks,
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.720]   even though they can't distinguish their tastes,
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.560]   is dependent on these neuropod cells and related pathways.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.580]   What this means for you is that anytime you eat
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:34.580]   something sweet, that substance is actually causing your gut,
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.880]   your stomach and your intestine,
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.160]   where to be more precise, I should say,
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.340]   that food substance is causing the neuropod cells
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.820]   in your stomach and intestines to send a parallel set
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:50.140]   of signals up to your brain saying, eat more of that,
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.300]   or simply eat more, eat more, eat more,
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.540]   and preferably eat more sweet foods.
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.820]   So we've all heard of hidden sugars,
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.660]   meaning the sugars that manufacturers have put into foods
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.580]   and disguise them with other flavors.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.660]   I talked about this in the episode on salt,
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.020]   using salt to mask the taste of sweetness
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.240]   so that people ingest more sugar.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.700]   That is not an accident that hidden sugars are often hidden
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.500]   with salt or with other flavors.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.940]   It's done so that people will, meaning you or me,
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:22.660]   will want to ingest more of a particular food independent
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.620]   of how sweet that food tastes.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.460]   And in fact, some crackers, for instance, chips,
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.020]   for instance, you might think, oh, well, you know, chips,
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.020]   they're not sweet, they're salty and savory.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.060]   Again, I'll mention, I love salty, savory foods,
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.160]   including certain foods.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.460]   I love kettle chips, for instance,
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.300]   I try not to walk by them in the grocery store.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.180]   I usually have to eat one bag while I'm in the store
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.540]   and then another later.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.540]   The savory foods are often laden with these hidden sugars
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.920]   that we can't register as sweetness,
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.360]   but trigger the neuropod cells,
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.820]   which then further trigger dopamine,
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.640]   which make us want more of them.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.300]   Now we may be able to resist eating more of them,
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:03.580]   but it makes us crave more food in general.
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.340]   Now we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway,
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:10.700]   to sort of intervene in this subconscious pathway.
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:14.500]   But for now, I'm hoping that just the understanding
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.800]   that we all have this pathway,
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.960]   this is hardwired into our body,
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.840]   could potentially allow people to better understand
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.420]   why is it that their cravings are so intense,
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.440]   that it's not necessarily just about the taste of that food.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:33.040]   And when you consider this in concert with the fact
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.040]   that we have this dopamine pain pleasure balance,
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.200]   excuse me, that I referred to earlier,
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.420]   you start to realize that there are multiple mechanisms
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:43.260]   hardwired into us that make it especially hard
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.340]   to not eat the sweet thing
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.460]   or to not eat the food that we're craving.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.800]   And indeed that's the case.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.720]   We have two major accelerators.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.980]   It's like a car with two accelerators
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:54.820]   and we will talk about the brakes,
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:58.060]   but two ways that really get us into forward motion
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.120]   toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.340]   Now, if it doesn't already seem diabolical enough
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.920]   that sweet things that we perceive as sweet
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.980]   make us want to eat more of those because of dopamine
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.740]   and then send us down this pain pleasure pathway
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.980]   that I mentioned earlier.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.960]   And the fact that we have this subconscious circuit
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.100]   coming from the neuropod cells in our gut
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.660]   that are registering the presence of sugar
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.660]   or glucose increasing foods in our gut
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:23.780]   and sending those signals to the brain
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.660]   for yet more dopamine pain pleasure challenges.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.980]   There's a third layer to this whole thing.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.280]   And that has to do with how sugar is metabolized
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.780]   in the brain, or I should say how glucose is used.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.260]   Without getting into too much detail,
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.660]   some of the more beautiful studies of neuroimaging
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:45.040]   and evaluating which brain areas are active
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.780]   when we eat certain foods were done by Dr. Dana Small's lab
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.180]   at Yale University and in some of her previous work
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.780]   when she was elsewhere and of course,
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.100]   by other laboratories too.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.660]   And they used an approach called
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.620]   positron emission tomography.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:02.920]   And they and others have used pet scanning as it's called,
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.420]   positron emission tomography.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.460]   Along with a tool called 2-Deoxyglucose.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.460]   2-Deoxyglucose is actually involved in the procedure
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.460]   of seeing which brain areas are active
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.480]   when people eat foods or engage in other types of behaviors.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.300]   But the way that 2-Deoxyglucose sometimes shortened 2DG,
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:25.500]   the way that it works is to block glucose uptake
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:29.660]   from neurons and instead bring along with it
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.380]   a marker that one can see through imaging.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.740]   So in other words,
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:37.160]   a tool for looking at what parts of the brain are active
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:41.420]   when eating particular foods actually prevents foods
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.460]   such as sugar from allowing glucose
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.900]   to get into particular neurons.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.980]   Now that might seem like a bad situation.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.480]   You'd say, well, wait, you're trying to understand
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.480]   how sugar works in the brain.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.420]   And then you block the ability for sugar glucose
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.700]   to bind to or be used by these neurons
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.500]   because of the thing that you're using for the experiment.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.380]   Exactly, it's a huge problem.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.620]   But it turns out to be a huge problem
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.060]   that led to a great insight.
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.460]   And the great insight is this.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.940]   The preference for sweet tasting foods and liquids
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.940]   is actually blocked by 2-Deoxyglucose.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.240]   What that means experimentally,
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.520]   but also in terms of what it means for you and me
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.840]   in the real world is that there's yet
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.760]   a third parallel pathway that's related
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.940]   to the use of blood sugar,
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.060]   the use of glucose by neurons
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:38.760]   that further reinforces our desire to eat more sweet things.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.860]   And the preference for sweet foods
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.400]   can actually be eliminated through 2-Deoxyglucose.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.340]   Now I definitely don't want people going out
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.800]   and consuming 2-Deoxyglucose.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.020]   This is a laboratory tool.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.000]   It is not something that you should be ingesting.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.100]   So don't go look it up and try and get some.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.140]   There might be other uses for it, but that's not the point.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:03.140]   The point is that it is the sweet taste of sugary foods.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.840]   It is the signals coming from your gut,
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.420]   from your digestive tract to your brain.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:13.820]   And it's the use of the metabolic consequences
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.580]   of sugary foods that are acting as a three-pronged push
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.800]   on your desire to consume more sugary foods.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.740]   So this car analogy that I used before
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.020]   where it's some weird car that has two accelerators,
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.340]   it actually has three accelerators.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:33.700]   And so with three accelerators all pushing the system hard,
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.740]   we can say, wow, there must be something really special
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.580]   about this pathway.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.660]   And indeed there is.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.660]   This pathway is the quickest source of fuel for the brain
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.720]   and the rest of the nervous system.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.460]   It's the preferred source of fuel
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.900]   for the brain and nervous system.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.580]   And I realized as I say that all the ketonistas
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.500]   are probably going, no,
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.340]   actually ketones are the preferred source.
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.920]   Okay, I acknowledge that there are conditions
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.100]   under which you can bring your blood glucose very low
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.280]   and there are reasons to do that.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.260]   Actually ketosis has been a terrifically successful treatment
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.680]   for a lot of forms of epilepsy,
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.900]   in particular, pediatric epilepsy.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.540]   Many people do derive benefit from ketogenic diets,
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.660]   so I'm not knocking ketogenic diets,
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:14.500]   but if you were to look at what neurons normally prefer,
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:19.500]   meaning in a typical diet regimen, it would be glucose.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.220]   And the fact that fructose
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.940]   is eventually converted to glucose,
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.700]   the fact that when we ingest sucrose,
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.840]   it's eventually converted into a fuel that neurons can use,
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.020]   that's very much in the glucose pathway.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.940]   What you basically arrive at is the fact
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.940]   that your nervous system is a glucose consuming machine
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.060]   and you've got at least three pathways
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.540]   of which I've described that are pushing on your brain
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.220]   consciously and subconsciously to get you to seek
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.140]   and consume more sugar.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:48.060]   Now that all sounds like a pretty depressing picture,
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.100]   at least for those of you that are trying
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.320]   to reduce your sugar intake.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.060]   And of course we can all reduce sugar intake
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.380]   by way of sheer will.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.440]   We can not have those foods at home.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.340]   We can restrict ourselves from those,
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.300]   but there are some things that we all can
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.980]   and perhaps should do in order to regulate these pathways
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.380]   such that we don't feel so controlled by them,
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:11.300]   but rather that we control their output.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.920]   And of course they are us and we are them.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.580]   So this gets into all sorts of issues of consciousness
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.540]   and free will that I certainly don't want to cover
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.860]   in this episode.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:22.740]   But nonetheless, I think once you understand
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.600]   that these circuits exist and you understand
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.200]   that there are simple substitutions and modifications
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.540]   that one can make to their food intake
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.780]   that can work within these pathways
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:37.140]   and even bypass some of these pathways,
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.380]   you start to realize that you have a lot more control
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.600]   over sugar intake and sugar appetite
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.140]   than you previously thought.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.540]   Now, many of you have heard of the so-called glycemic index.
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.340]   The glycemic index is a measure
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.960]   of how quickly blood sugar rises
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.940]   after ingesting particular foods, and very broadly speaking,
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.940]   we can say that there are low glycemic index foods
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.040]   of less than 55, typically is the measurement,
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.900]   or medium glycemic index foods,
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.900]   which go from about 55 to 69,
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.860]   and then so-called high glycemic foods, which are above 70.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.900]   And of course there's additional nuance
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.900]   related to glycemic load
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.940]   and many more features of the glycemic index.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.180]   A couple of things to understand
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.720]   about how the glycemic index is measured.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.740]   And then I'd like to just briefly talk
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.860]   about how the glycemic index can be leveraged
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.340]   to short circuit some of the neural circuits
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.740]   that would otherwise lead us to crave
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.060]   and perhaps even ingest sugary foods.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.740]   First of all, measurements of glycemic indices of food
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.460]   are typically made by having people ingest those foods
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.780]   in isolation.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:46.420]   And in general, we can say that anytime we ingest fiber
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.840]   and or fat lipids along with a particular food,
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.840]   it will reduce the glycemic index of that particular food,
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.340]   either the absolute level of blood glucose
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:00.100]   that a particular food causes
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:05.060]   or the rate at which that elevation in blood glucose occurs.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:09.240]   And this is why there are some seemingly paradoxical aspects
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.400]   to sweet stuff in terms of the glycemic index.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.480]   For instance, ice cream has a lower glycemic index
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.440]   provided it's ice cream that includes fat,
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.280]   which I hope it would
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.400]   'cause that's the good tasting ice cream in my opinion,
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.120]   compared to something like mangoes or table sugar, right?
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.160]   So the glycemic index is not something to hold wholly
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.940]   in most cases because most people
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.000]   are not ingesting foods in isolation.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.480]   And there's actually a lot of argument
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.920]   as to whether or not the glycemic index
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.160]   is really as vital as some people claim.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.560]   There's also the context in which you ingest
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.400]   particular foods.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.620]   As I mentioned earlier,
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:45.040]   after I do hard training of any kind,
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.860]   meaning training that ought to deplete glycogen,
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.040]   so hard resistance training,
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.360]   I actually make it a point
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.260]   to ingest some very sweet high glycemic foods like a mango.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.680]   I'll also ingest some starches
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.040]   'cause I'm trying to replenish glycogen.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.740]   I'm also trying to spike my blood sugar a little bit
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.020]   because that can be advantageous
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.160]   in terms of certain strength
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.160]   and hypertrophy protocols, et cetera.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.440]   But most of the time I'm avoiding these high glycemic foods
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.280]   and high sugar foods.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.560]   I should point that out.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.680]   Now, why am I telling you about the glycemic index?
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.260]   Well, if we zoom out and take our perspective
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.640]   on all of this discussion about the glycemic index
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.060]   through the lens of the nervous system,
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.340]   and we remind ourselves that neurons
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.220]   prefer glucose for energy,
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.200]   and that all sweet things
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.620]   or things that we perceive as sweet,
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.860]   but also sweet things that are ingested
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:30.500]   and registered by those neuro pod cells in our gut
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.400]   trigger the release of dopamine
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.360]   and trigger these neural circuits
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.960]   to make us want to eat more of these foods,
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.000]   what we start to realize is that a sharp rise
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.840]   in blood glucose or a very high degree of elevation
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.860]   in blood glucose is going to be a much more potent signal
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.600]   than will a more moderate rise in blood glucose
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.840]   or a slower rise in blood glucose.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.200]   So if we think about the analogy of three accelerators,
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.080]   meaning three parallel neural circuits,
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.240]   all essentially there to get us to seek out
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.220]   and consume more sweet tasting and sugary foods.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.960]   Well, then the glycemic index is sort of our measurement
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.920]   of how hard we are pushing down
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.440]   or how fast we are pushing down on those three accelerators.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.520]   And so those of you that are trying to reduce sugar intake,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.000]   and you want to do that through an understanding
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.520]   of how these neural circuits work,
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.580]   and you want to short circuit some of the dopamine release
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.100]   that's caused by ingesting sugary foods,
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.100]   it can be advantageous to ingest sweet foods,
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.940]   either alone or in combination with foods
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.860]   that reduce glycemic index or reduce glycemic load.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:45.980]   So that might mean making different food choices.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.760]   So paying attention to sweet tasting foods
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.860]   that can satisfy sugar cravings, but do not have as steep,
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.300]   or I should say, do not cause
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.980]   a steeper rise in blood sugar,
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:59.220]   or it could mean consuming other foods
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:03.220]   along with sweet foods in order to reduce the glycemic index
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:07.320]   and thereby slow or blunt the release of dopamine.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.260]   You might think, well, why would I want to do that?
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.640]   I want the maximum dopamine output
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.260]   in response to a given sweet food.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.440]   I don't just want the level 10,
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.040]   I want the level 100 output of dopamine,
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.560]   but you really don't because of the pleasure pain balance
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.660]   that dopamine causes.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.940]   And in fact, if we consider some of the non-food substances
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.260]   that really push hard on these dopamine pathways,
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.840]   we can come up with a somewhat sinister,
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.820]   but nonetheless appropriate analogy.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:36.100]   The drug cocaine causes very robust,
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.480]   potent increases in dopamine within the brain
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.860]   and typically causes people to want to ingest more cocaine
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:47.240]   because of those sharp increases in dopamine.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.100]   But within the category of the drug cocaine,
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.080]   there are various modes of ingestion.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.680]   Some people inhale it,
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.480]   some people will inject it intravenously,
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.860]   some people will smoke it.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.080]   And those different forms of taking cocaine
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.880]   actually impact the dopamine circuits differently.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.640]   And it turns out that crack cocaine,
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.220]   the smokable form of cocaine rock,
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.900]   increases dopamine to a very high degree,
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.220]   but also very, very quickly.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:20.520]   And it is the sharp rise in dopamine over time,
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.360]   not so much the absolute level of dopamine
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.400]   that makes crack cocaine so absolutely addictive.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.360]   So sometimes you'll hear, sugar is like crack.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.100]   Well, and that's getting a little extreme
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.020]   because even though I don't think the measurements
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.060]   have been done in the same experiment,
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.120]   I think it's reasonable to think that
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.020]   the absolute level of dopamine caused by ingesting sugar,
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.860]   at least for most people,
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.500]   is not going to be as high as the absolute level
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.360]   of dopamine caused by smoking crack.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.460]   Of course, it goes without saying,
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.120]   please don't do cocaine in any form, by the way.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   It is appropriate to say that the rate of dopamine increase
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   over time has a profound effect on how people will,
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.520]   and if people will, go on to want to pursue more
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.120]   of what caused that increase in dopamine.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.720]   So what I'm basically saying is,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.080]   if you're going to ingest sweet foods
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.020]   in order to satisfy a sweet craving,
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.600]   ingesting sweet foods for which the glycemic index
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.600]   is lower or in which you've adjusted
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.120]   those glycemic index foods through the co-ingestion of fiber
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.560]   or maybe fat might be beneficial.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.440]   So is this justification for putting peanut butter
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.200]   on that piece of chocolate or for having a bowl of ice cream
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.160]   along with the mango that you're craving?
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.440]   In some sense, yes.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.360]   However, there's also the issue of how sweet
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.280]   and how delicious something tastes.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.680]   Highly palatable foods, absolutely delicious foods,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.640]   trigger that one neural circuit, that one accelerator
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.300]   that we're talking about in terms of our analogy
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.900]   of three accelerators.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.800]   And the more delicious something tastes within our mouth,
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.620]   the further increase in dopamine.
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.860]   So if you really wanted to adjust your sugar cravings
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:12.580]   and you really still want to ingest some sugary foods,
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.500]   you probably would be better off combining fiber
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.960]   with that sugary or sweet food.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.900]   Now, I do realize that it's somewhat unusual
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.240]   and you probably get some strange stares
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.000]   if you decided to consume broccoli, for instance,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.760]   along with your chocolate or with another dessert
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.960]   that would otherwise cause a steep increase in blood sugar
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.640]   and has a high glycemic index.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.880]   But nonetheless, if your goal is to blunt
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.380]   your sugar cravings, what you really need to do
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.320]   is blunt that dopamine increase.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.240]   So what we're really talking about here
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.120]   is trying to reduce the dopamine signal
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.720]   that is the consequence of ingesting sweet foods.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.040]   And we're talking about doing that
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.820]   through these different parallel pathways,
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.920]   not just by preventing sweet taste,
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.760]   but also by preventing the post-ingestive effects
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.720]   of sweet foods.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.620]   And of course, the backdrop to all of this
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.240]   is that most of us, again, most of us, not all of us,
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.760]   should probably be ingesting fewer refined sugars.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.600]   Certainly there are exceptions to that,
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.020]   but I think the bulk of data point to the fact
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.560]   that ingesting these highly palatable,
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.840]   certainly highly palatable, highly processed foods
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.320]   or foods that contain a lot of high fructose corn syrup
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.760]   can be really deleterious to our health, especially in kids.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.560]   And I'm not going to cite off a bunch of statistics.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.400]   You've all heard them before that, you know,
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.800]   for hundreds of years, we ingested, you know,
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.280]   the equivalent of a few cups or pounds of sugar per year.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.820]   And, you know, now people are ingesting hundreds of pounds
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.300]   of sugar per year.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.680]   The major culprit always seems to be sugary drinks,
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.640]   meaning soft drinks.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.440]   And I think indeed that's the case.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.640]   I do want to point out the incredible work
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.800]   of Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.840]   at University of California, San Francisco,
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.200]   who was really early in the game of voicing the dangers
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.520]   of so-called hidden sugars and highly processed foods.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.760]   There are other people, of course, now talking about this.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.580]   His laboratory has done important work showing,
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.100]   for instance, that if high fructose corn syrup
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:13.100]   or even just fructose is replaced with glucose,
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.660]   even if the same number of calories is ingested,
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.260]   that there are important,
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:23.380]   meaning significant reductions in type two diabetes,
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.140]   some of the metabolic syndromes associated
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.000]   with high fructose corn syrup and on and on and on.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.640]   And of course there are other culprits in type two diabetes.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.860]   There are other factors that are going to lead to obesity,
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.400]   but I think the work from Lustig and others
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.160]   has really illustrated that we should all be trying
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.380]   to reduce our intake of highly refined sugars
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.240]   and high fructose corn syrup,
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.620]   and certainly trying to reduce our intake
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:51.240]   of very sugary drinks, not just soft drinks,
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.920]   but also fruit juices that contain a lot of sugar.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.060]   Now, even for people that are of healthy weight
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.320]   and who don't have metabolic syndromes,
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.160]   there may be an additional reason
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.640]   to not want to ingest very sweet foods
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.200]   and highly refined sugars.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.160]   And this has to do with a new and emerging area
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.020]   of nutrition neuroscience.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.660]   And I want to point out that these are new data, right?
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:15.640]   So it's not a lock.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.560]   The double-blind placebo-controlled studies
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.280]   in large populations have not been finished.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.380]   So I want to make sure that that's clear,
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.320]   but I also want to make clear
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.340]   what some of the really exciting data
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.720]   coming from Dana Small's lab at Yale
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.000]   and from other laboratories are showing.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.880]   And this has to do with what's called
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.040]   conditioned taste preference.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.620]   Using a kind of Pavlovian paradigm,
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.920]   what they do is they have people,
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.760]   and these studies were done in people,
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.920]   ingest maltodextrin, which increases blood glucose.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.960]   Doesn't have much flavor,
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.760]   but even if it does have a little bit of subtle flavor,
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.640]   the maltodextrin is cloaked by some other flavor.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.280]   And by cloaking it with that other flavor
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.900]   or pairing it with that other flavor,
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.840]   what they find is that over time,
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.340]   because the maltodextrin increases blood glucose
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.000]   and they're ingesting a particular flavor
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   along with that maltodextrin,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.080]   they can then remove the maltodextrin
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:13.800]   and the flavor will induce an increase in insulin.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.320]   The increase in insulin, of course,
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.960]   is the consequence of the fact
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.740]   that anytime there's a rise in blood glucose,
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.380]   provided the person isn't diabetic,
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.220]   there's a parallel increase in insulin.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.880]   Now, this is very interesting
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.500]   because what it says is, well, at a first pass,
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.600]   it says that we are very Pavlovian
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.880]   in terms of our physiological responses to foods
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.620]   and particular flavors come to be associated
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.220]   with particular patterns of blood glucose increase
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.280]   and hence patterns of insulin increase
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.240]   because of course insulin manages glucose in the bloodstream,
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.440]   as I mentioned earlier.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.400]   This also has implications
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.840]   for understanding things like artificial sweeteners.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.720]   And here, I want to highlight
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.360]   that this is still very controversial work,
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.880]   needs more data, but nonetheless,
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.280]   I'd like to share it with you for consideration.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.620]   The small laboratory has done studies in humans,
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:08.600]   both in adults and in children,
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.020]   showing that if the flavor of artificial sweeteners
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.800]   is paired with maltodextrin,
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.400]   and then the maltodextrin is removed,
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.880]   that the artificial sweetener taste itself
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.440]   can subsequently increase insulin in the bloodstream.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.000]   In other words, taking something that increases blood sugar,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.880]   attaching a flavor experience to that,
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.160]   having children or adults ingest that thing
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.680]   allows the nervous system to associate that flavor
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.540]   with that increase in blood glucose,
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.140]   but then you can remove the glucose increasing substance
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.580]   and the flavor alone will increase insulin
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.160]   because insulin typically follows blood glucose.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.000]   So this is a conditioning effect.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.960]   Now, the reason these data are controversial
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:54.800]   is several fold.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.180]   First of all, the landscape around,
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.220]   the discussion around artificial sweeteners
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.640]   is definitely what I would call a barbed wire topic.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.560]   And I want to preface what I'm about to say next
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.220]   by saying I actually ingest artificial sweeteners.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.280]   I will have the occasional diet soda, not every day,
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.980]   maybe, I don't know, once or twice a month.
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:15.080]   I don't particularly like the taste,
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.480]   but I'll do it just 'cause it's around
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.880]   and I want some caffeine and I like the carbonation
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.560]   if I'm on a plane or something.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:24.480]   I do ingest plant-based non-caloric sweeteners.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.440]   To my knowledge, there have not been high quality studies
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.480]   of plant-based non-caloric sweeteners
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.440]   in the context that I'm referring to here, okay?
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440]   Nonetheless, these studies show that,
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.880]   particular flavors can be conditioned
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.800]   to cause an insulin increase.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.800]   And the flavor associated
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.600]   with certain artificial sweeteners
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.160]   is included in that category of flavors
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.800]   that can induce insulin even in the absence
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.660]   of something that can increase blood glucose.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:54.620]   Now, the simple takeaway from these studies
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.520]   would be the following.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.680]   And this is actually the one interpretation
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.880]   that Dana Small has offered to her data,
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.920]   but she offers other interpretations as well.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.760]   One interpretation is that if people
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.440]   are going to ingest artificial sweeteners
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.680]   and they do that along with foods
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.100]   that very sharply increase blood glucose,
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.640]   then there is the potential, highlight,
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.920]   the potential for those same artificial sweeteners
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:24.720]   to increase insulin even in the absence of food.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.600]   In other words, let's just draw the scenario out
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.480]   in the real world.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:33.820]   You're having a diet soda along with a cheeseburger and fries.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.880]   You do that every day for lunch, okay?
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.940]   Somewhat extreme example, but natural world example.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:41.040]   You do that every day for lunch
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.500]   and then you just have a diet soda alone.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:47.660]   The extreme interpretation of the data
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.340]   that they've collected says, well,
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.420]   that diet soda alone will increase insulin
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.860]   even though there's no increase in blood glucose
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.020]   because you have an ingested food with it
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:58.580]   because you conditioned that taste of artificial sweetener
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.180]   to the experience of a rise in glucose and hence insulin.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.780]   Now, the counter argument to this would be,
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.740]   well, that's a very unusual situation.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:10.060]   Maltodextrin causes big increases in blood glucose.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.740]   So that's not really a fair experiment
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.340]   or it's not a natural world experiment.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.280]   And I think that's a decent assessment.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.260]   Although I will point out that one of the reasons
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.760]   why this study is so controversial
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.400]   or why these data are so controversial
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.200]   is that the experiment actually had to be stopped.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.040]   And particularly the experiment in children had to be stopped
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.520]   because the changes in insulin that were observed
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.480]   early in the study were so detrimental
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.040]   that the institutional review board quite appropriately said,
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.300]   we can't do this to these kids.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.600]   They're experiencing these odd shifts in insulin
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.720]   that are not healthy for them
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.760]   when they're just ingesting artificial sweeteners
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.800]   in the absence of these glucose increasing foods.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.040]   So once again, I do ingest artificial sweeteners.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.280]   I'm not saying that they are dangerous.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.620]   I'm not saying that they are not dangerous.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.900]   I'm saying that you have to decide for yourself.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.820]   In previous episodes,
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.580]   I've highlighted that artificial sweeteners have been shown
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.880]   in studies of animals that when given in very high doses,
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.880]   sucralose in particular,
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.400]   there can be fairly robust disruption to the gut microbiome,
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.520]   which is vital for immune health and brain health,
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.120]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.040]   But thus far our knowledge of how artificial sweeteners
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.760]   negatively impacts or positively impacts, I should say,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.760]   the microbiome and other deleterious effects on the body
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.080]   has mainly been explored in animal studies.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.360]   Again, the work by Dana Small has been done in humans.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.000]   There's some parallel work by others in animal models.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.540]   I bring it up today to illustrate the following point.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.240]   Normally we have a pathway
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.000]   that we don't have to condition at all.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.120]   It's there from birth whereby ingestion of sweet foods
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.600]   causes increases in dopamine.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:02.000]   And there are parallel pathways by which neurons in our gut
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.520]   and elsewhere in our body
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.820]   trigger further increases in dopamine.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:10.240]   So there's no need for a conditioned response
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.600]   or to become Pavlovian about this, right?
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.540]   You're hardwired to want to eat sweet things
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.580]   by at least two and probably three parallel pathways.
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.600]   Now, the work from Dana Small's lab and others
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.860]   that have illustrated this conditioned flavor preference,
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:27.980]   I think beautifully show that any flavor
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:30.640]   that's associated with a glucose spike
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.340]   or a long sustained increase in glucose
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.900]   can also be conditioned.
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.020]   In other words, the circuits for dopamine
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.540]   that reinforce the desire to eat particular things
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.380]   is not unique to the sugar pathway.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:45.460]   And this is one of the reasons I believe
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.820]   why ingestion of sweet foods
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:50.580]   doesn't just lead us to want to eat more sweet foods.
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.200]   I think that is absolutely clear
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.540]   based on animal data and on human data.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.500]   I think that's robust.
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.540]   It's actually the stuff of textbooks now.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.820]   But in addition, ingesting sweet foods
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:03.940]   and or foods that raise blood glucose,
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:05.780]   but that we don't perceive as sweet.
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.300]   So for instance, foods with hidden sugars,
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.980]   sugars that have been masked by salty or spicy tastes
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.900]   increases our desire for glucose elevating foods
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.900]   and food generally.
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:20.060]   I think that's the only logical interpretation of the data
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.580]   that I can arrive at.
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.800]   So for people that struggle with regulating their appetite
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.220]   or with regulating their sugar appetite,
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:29.100]   I think the understanding of conditioned flavor preference
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:32.100]   while a little bit complicated ought to be useful
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.700]   in trying to navigate reducing sugar cravings
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.780]   and sugar intake.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.380]   As a segue into tools to control sugar intake
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:42.520]   as a means to both regulate sugar intake itself,
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.380]   as well as food intake overall
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.360]   and steer us towards healthier choices,
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.400]   I'd like to talk about some of the special populations
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.880]   out there that might want to be especially wary
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.680]   of having a dysregulated sugar appetite system.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.000]   And the group I'm referring to specifically
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.200]   are those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.960]   or I should say, and or people who have issues
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   with focus and attention generally.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.280]   And I think more and more nowadays,
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.040]   I'm hearing that people are having a hard time focusing.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.980]   This probably has something to do with our interactions
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.240]   with electronic devices.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.600]   As I always say, if a picture is worth a thousand words,
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.520]   a movie is worth a million pictures.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.200]   And the fact that we can access so many movies
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.140]   in just by scrolling with our thumb
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.240]   is something that the nervous system
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.780]   has just never contended with before in human history.
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:32.320]   I'm confident in that.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.240]   And it's not that it can't deal with it.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.320]   The question is what's the trade-off?
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.620]   What are the consequences of that?
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:42.620]   So attention and ability to focus is obviously key
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.080]   to success in school, success in relationships,
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.360]   success in the workplace, and success in life.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.140]   We could probably even go so far as to say
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:53.420]   one's ability to succeed in anything
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.600]   is proportional to one's ability to focus
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.280]   and then deliberately defocus
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.940]   when the time comes to defocus, right?
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.820]   'Cause we all need rest and we need to disengage
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:01.740]   and then re-engage.
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:07.880]   If you look at the sum total of the meta-analyses
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:12.100]   and the clinical data on ADHD and nutrition,
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.160]   you arrive at a pretty clear answer,
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.160]   which is that sugar consumption,
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.020]   in particular highly refined sugars,
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.080]   is just not good for people with ADHD
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.780]   or with attentional issues.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:25.420]   Now, as I say that, I also want you to recall
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.140]   the earlier study that I referred to
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.420]   whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:30.980]   is highly dependent on glucose.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:34.080]   So this doesn't mean consuming no glucose
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.100]   is going to be a good idea.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.560]   It doesn't mean that the ketogenic diet
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.340]   is necessarily the best diet for ADHD,
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.500]   although there are some people pursuing that
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.120]   and exploring that, and we'll do yet another episode
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.260]   on ADHD at some point that goes a little bit deeper
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:48.860]   into that because there's some new data.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:53.860]   I did do a very long and fairly extensive episode on ADHD.
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:57.860]   You're welcome to look that up if you like in our archive,
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.060]   excuse me, in our archive at hubermanlab.com.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.480]   It's all timestamped.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.720]   So, you know, because a number of people said,
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.440]   oh, you know, it's an episode on ADHD
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.680]   and you made it two and a half hours long.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.640]   Yes, we did because we wanted it to be as comprehensive
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.220]   as we could at the time, but it is timestamps.
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.160]   You can just jump to the particular topics of interest
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.480]   in their short little cassettes there.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.220]   Now, if you'd like to know upon what I'm basing
[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:23.900]   the statement that sugar consumption
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:25.800]   and highly refined sugar consumption
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.300]   is potentially bad for ADHD,
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:33.020]   basing this mainly on the conclusions of a really nice paper
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.940]   that the title of the paper is Sugar Consumption,
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.280]   Sugar Sweetened Beverages
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.320]   and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.220]   A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.380]   And this is a paper and we'll put a link to this
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.600]   in the caption.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.720]   This was publishing complimentary therapies in medicine,
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.000]   which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense,
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.400]   but I really like this meta-analysis.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:58.400]   The sum total of this meta-analysis is really that when,
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:04.220]   especially kids get beyond four sugary drinks per week,
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.100]   so four sodas of, you know, typical 12 ounce soda,
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:10.100]   when they get past four 12 ounce sugary sodas,
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.500]   they didn't, as far as I know,
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.140]   look at artificial sweetened sodas,
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.320]   that's when you start to see a shift
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.900]   towards more negative outcomes,
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.940]   more symptoms of existing ADHD.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:24.020]   Now, where the controversy comes in
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:26.180]   is whether or not sugar consumption
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.020]   can actually trigger or cause ADHD.
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:32.140]   And I don't think we can conclude that at all at this time.
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:35.260]   And this review, if you decide to check it out,
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:37.260]   review slash meta-analysis, I should say,
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.420]   if you decide to check it out,
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.820]   goes into some of the nuance around that.
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:45.260]   What's also interesting in terms of ADHD and sugar intake,
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.120]   and probably has relevance to all of us,
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.620]   is that they also cover some of the interesting data
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:53.980]   showing that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:55.860]   can actually be beneficial
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:59.320]   for people and particular kids with ADHD.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.420]   I've talked before about the utility of omega-3s
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:03.800]   that's been shown in various studies
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.420]   that have compared omega-3 fatty acid intake
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.860]   to say prescription antidepressants, like SSRIs,
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:12.740]   like Prozac, Zoloft, and similar, fluoxetine.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:15.140]   And the results of those studies are pretty clear,
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.380]   at least to me, that provided that one gets
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.620]   at least one gram of EPA essential fatty acids,
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.380]   so it's not just getting one gram per day,
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.860]   but one or more grams per day
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.520]   of the EPA form of essential fatty acid
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.820]   can rival some prescription antidepressants
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:35.180]   and/or decrease the amount of antidepressants
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.040]   that's required to take, which for a lot of people
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.920]   can be a very useful thing
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.400]   because of the side effect profile
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.540]   of many of those antidepressants.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.520]   Of course, talk to your psychiatrist, talk to your doctor,
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.260]   but the omega-3s are no doubt powerful.
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.460]   And then of course, there's a whole story
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.500]   about omega-3s and heart health.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.100]   And of course, like anything else,
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.780]   there's some controversy around omega-3s,
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.580]   but I think the data are clear enough to me
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:56.020]   around mood and cardiovascular health
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.740]   that certainly I personally ingest them,
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.780]   but as always, I always say,
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.980]   anytime you're going to add or remove anything
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:03.980]   from your nutrition, supplementation, exercise,
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.280]   or otherwise your lifestyle,
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.260]   definitely consult with a board-certified physician.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.540]   I don't just say that to protect me.
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.320]   I say that to protect you.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.860]   You are responsible for your health ultimately.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.380]   So omega-3 supplementation has been shown
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.380]   to be beneficial for ADHD.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.640]   Why am I talking about this in the context of an episode
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.300]   on sugar and the nervous system?
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.940]   Well, if you remember those neuropod cells,
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:27.100]   those cells in your gut that respond to sugar
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.620]   and send signals up to the brain
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.380]   to cause the release of dopamine,
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:34.540]   well, it turns out that neuropod cells also respond to
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:37.380]   amino acids and to fatty acids,
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:40.260]   in particular, essential fatty acids.
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:45.260]   So the cells that we call neuropod cells have three jobs.
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.940]   One is to detect levels of sugar in the gut.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:51.060]   The other is to detect levels of amino acids
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:54.740]   and to detect levels of particular essential fatty acids
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:58.340]   and communicate that information to the brain.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:28:59.180]   And I should point out,
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:00.540]   when I say communicate that information,
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.380]   they're not actually saying,
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.740]   "Hey, there's amino acids here,"
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.500]   or, "Hey, there's sugar here,"
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.100]   or, "Hey, there's essential fatty acids,"
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:09.140]   because the language of these cells is somewhat generic.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:11.700]   It's just the firing of electrical potentials.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:12.740]   But that's the key point.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:16.540]   It's generic and all three, or any of those three,
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:19.460]   sugar, essential fatty acids, or amino acids
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.360]   will trigger these neurons to signal to the brain
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.220]   to increase dopamine.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.940]   And it is not coincidental
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:27.460]   that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.420]   can help ameliorate some of the symptoms of ADHD
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.940]   by way of presumably increasing dopamine
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.140]   in this neuropod to dopamine pathway
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.180]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:41.900]   The whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:43.860]   and points to, yet again,
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:47.580]   the immense value of bringing the proper amounts,
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.540]   maybe even supplementing the proper amounts
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.820]   of omega-3 fatty acids
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.980]   and the proper amounts of amino acids into the gut
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.200]   as a way to supplant some of the stimulation
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.100]   of these pathways that would otherwise be caused by sugar.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:04.080]   There's actually a version of this where one could say,
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.780]   if you want to reduce sugar cravings,
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:10.580]   you might consider increasing certain forms
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:13.780]   of amino acid intake or certain forms of fatty acid intake.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:17.180]   So what are some ways that we can reduce our sugar cravings?
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.000]   And ideally, ways that we can do that
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.540]   that also benefit us in other ways,
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.380]   both nutritionally and from the neuroscience standpoint?
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:29.240]   Well, these neuropod cells that respond to
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.720]   and signal the brain when we ingest sugar,
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.600]   as I mentioned, also respond to amino acids
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.220]   and essential fatty acids.
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.740]   We already talked about the essential fatty acids.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.760]   I make it a particular point to ingest anywhere
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.960]   from one to three grams, that's grams,
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.180]   of EPA essential fatty acid per day.
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:48.020]   I make it a point to do that
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:51.060]   with the ingestion of high quality omega-3s.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.100]   For me, the simplest way to do that,
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.420]   and I think for most people, the lowest cost way to do that
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.340]   is to use some liquid form of fish oil
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.080]   or some capsule form of fish oil.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.100]   You really do have to see how much essential fatty acid
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.260]   in the form of EPA is in those.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.980]   If you try and do that only through capsules,
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.100]   it can get kind of expensive
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.560]   depending on which particular brands you use.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.260]   Some have more EPA, some less.
[01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.120]   You can, of course, also do this through foods.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.740]   You can do this with non-fish sources
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:20.180]   through things like algae, and there's some other forms.
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.800]   You can look it up online now,
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.180]   plant-based sources of EPAs.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.780]   You can do this with high quality fish oil.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:30.000]   In any case, that does seem,
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.820]   at least based on a modest amount,
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:35.380]   but nonetheless solid literature,
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:38.400]   to reduce sugar cravings somewhat,
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:41.960]   but that could easily be by mere replacement of calories.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.620]   So we don't know yet, based on human studies,
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.440]   whether or not the ingestion of those EPAs
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.840]   is specifically activating the neuropod cells,
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.620]   which specifically activates dopamine release
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:55.160]   and bypasses the need for, or the craving for sugar.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   We don't know that yet,
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.580]   but logically it holds up to assume that.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.200]   The fact that these neuropod cells,
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.640]   and I should say other neurons within the gut,
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.920]   respond very robustly to the presence
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:12.920]   of particular amino acids is also a potential lever
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.760]   by which one could reduce sugar cravings.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.740]   And there's an interesting literature
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.560]   around the amino acid glutamine,
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:21.460]   in particular supplementing with the amino acid glutamine,
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.760]   as it relates to sugar cravings.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:27.680]   And certainly as it relates to other aspects of the gut,
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.560]   in particular leaky gut.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.440]   The use of supplemental glutamine
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.280]   to try and treat leaky gut is not a new phenomenon.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.260]   There are other approaches too, of course,
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:39.300]   but there are many people who are experimenting
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.680]   with supplementing with glutamine,
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.180]   several grams per day,
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:46.060]   often even five grams distributed
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:49.360]   through three or four different servings throughout the day
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.560]   as a way to blunt their sugar cravings.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:55.900]   Now, there has not yet been a large-scale clinical trial
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.760]   using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings,
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.320]   but the results of the few studies that I looked at,
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.620]   as well as my understanding of the logic
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:06.420]   of these neural circuits, including the neuropod cells,
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:10.680]   brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense why,
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.240]   if there's a population of neurons within our gut
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.940]   that responds very robustly to the presence of sugar,
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:18.480]   fatty acids, or amino acids,
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.160]   that the intake of particular amino acids
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.680]   would allow the dopamine pathways
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.320]   that might otherwise be triggered by sugar
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.600]   to be triggered by something like glutamine,
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.160]   which has very few or no calories.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.180]   And in fact, having talked about this previously,
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:37.640]   a number of people that I know went out and tried this.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:40.320]   Now, this is, of course, is what I call anecdata, right?
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.540]   This is not a quality peer-reviewed study.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.680]   This is anecdata.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.720]   Many of them have reported back that they actually feel
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.980]   as if their sugar cravings are reduced.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:53.080]   I know some people who actually take glutamine
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.460]   and mix it with full fat cream
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.040]   and take it kind of like a shot of full fat cream,
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.640]   which sounds absolutely delicious, by the way.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:58.800]   Glutamine is a little bit chalky,
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.960]   so it's not that great tasting to ingest with sugar.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.960]   I should mention, if you do try and take this approach
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.780]   of ingesting glutamine to reduce sugar cravings,
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:08.360]   you want to increase the amount of glutamine
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.900]   that you take somewhat gradually.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:12.000]   It can create some gastric distress.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:12.840]   If you just, you know,
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.480]   I certainly wouldn't take a big tablespoon of it,
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.520]   throw it in water and chug it down three times a day.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.920]   Some of you with very hearty stomachs
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:19.400]   can probably tolerate that.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.660]   You know, if you're like my, you know, my bulldog,
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.440]   which unfortunately passed away, but Costello,
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.480]   I always imagined that if ever we did an autopsy on him,
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.640]   he'd have like a license plate
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.440]   and like a human being in his gut,
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.020]   'cause it seemed like he could ingest anything
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:31.860]   with no issues.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.480]   But of course, many people have kind of sensitive guts.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:37.240]   So if you're going to try taking glutamine
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.960]   as a means to reduce sugar cravings,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.280]   just know that the studies are still ongoing.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.440]   Some people have achieved benefit.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.740]   Please also realize that there's an entire literature
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:49.720]   devoted to the potential hazards of increasing glutamine
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.400]   if you have a preexisting cancer.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.600]   So if you have cancer or you're cancer prone,
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.640]   I would really discourage you from this approach.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.800]   And in any case, as always, talk to your doctor.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.400]   The logic nonetheless is there,
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.760]   why increasing amino acid intake or fatty acid intake
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.680]   might decrease sugar craving.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.700]   Now, there are other ways to reduce sugar craving,
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:15.300]   and there are certainly ways to reduce the sharp rise
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.380]   in blood glucose that can occur
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.580]   when we ingest sugary sweet foods,
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.440]   or even just an abundance of carbohydrate foods.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.560]   And there are a huge number of these things.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.040]   I'm going to sort of layer up through the ones
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.000]   that you might find in your cupboard or at the grocery store
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.720]   and then get into some of the more extravagant,
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:34.080]   or I should say esoteric ones.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.560]   Many of which, however, can be quite potent.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.960]   The first of which is simple lemon juice, right?
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.360]   Or lime juice.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:45.500]   There was an old lore and actually some papers
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:48.840]   pointing to the idea that the ingestion of vinegar,
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.900]   either white vinegar or wine vinegar
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.620]   could somehow blunt blood glucose
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.240]   after the ingestion of sugary foods
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.400]   or the ingestion of a lot of carbohydrate foods
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.220]   or even just a big meal.
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:02.960]   Actually, Tim Ferriss, I should say the great Tim Ferriss,
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.480]   'cause I do have great respect for the fact
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.040]   that he seems to be about 10 years ahead of everything,
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.140]   both in terms of nutrition and skill learning
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:10.980]   and things of that sort.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.500]   Many of the things that he predicted in his books,
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.720]   the four hour body and the four hour chef
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.280]   actually turned out to be true based on scientific data,
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.220]   some of which only exists in the animal models,
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:26.220]   but now also some predictions that played out to be true
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.500]   in both the animal models and the human model.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:33.500]   So I think that Tim certainly deserves a hat tip
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:36.140]   for the fact that he experimented with these methods
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:39.280]   and reported his experiences with those methods
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.560]   and that now some of them, many of them have been validated
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.220]   by what I perceive to be quality science.
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:46.800]   He talked about the fact that,
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.620]   at least in his experiments on himself,
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:54.040]   the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucose
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:56.080]   and he was using continuous glucose monitors.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.120]   These incidentally,
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.400]   another example of where Ferriss was early to the game
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.680]   and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake,
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.740]   he talked about the use of blood glucose monitors.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:07.920]   Those I think at the time were implanted below the skin.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:11.040]   Nowadays, they're less invasive blood glucose monitors,
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.280]   things like levels and so forth,
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.080]   and these are actually becoming pretty popular.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.200]   I've worn one of these before,
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.360]   they're actually pretty informative.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.880]   I learned, for instance, that when I go in the sauna,
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.320]   that I experienced a sharp rise in blood glucose
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.180]   and that makes sense because of the dehydration associated
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.800]   with being in the sauna, a lot of sweating,
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.360]   concentration of sugar in the bloodstream goes up.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.080]   So there's some other things that certain foods
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.660]   affect my blood glucose one way or another.
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:36.920]   It's kind of an interesting and fun experiment
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.840]   that some of you might be interested in doing as well.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:43.560]   Regardless, there are now data pointing to the fact
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.340]   that lemon juice and lime juice,
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:48.460]   a couple of tablespoons or so,
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:50.300]   if ingested before or even during
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.300]   or even after consumption of sugary foods,
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:57.080]   or I should say foods that sharply increase blood glucose
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.480]   or large carbohydrate meals can actually blunt
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.840]   the blood glucose response.
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.240]   And I did see that when I did my own experiments on myself
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.560]   with continuous glucose monitor.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.620]   It was kind of fun to do those experiments.
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:11.020]   I preferred to do those experiments
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.680]   by eating somewhat larger meals
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.760]   of things that didn't contain a lot of sugar.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.580]   I saw some big increases in blood glucose
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.460]   in certain instances.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:20.240]   And then I would ingest some lemon juice or lime juice,
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:21.700]   typically mixed in with water.
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:23.380]   And sure enough, you could see a blunting
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.620]   of the blood glucose response.
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:27.800]   And of course, this was real time blood continuous,
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:30.920]   hence continuous blood glucose monitoring.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.960]   So for those of you that are interested
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.220]   in blunting your blood sugar response, certain foods,
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:39.300]   that's a simple low cost way to do that
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:40.140]   if you want to explore it.
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.960]   I will say if you are fasting
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.140]   and you already have low blood glucose
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:47.720]   and you ingest lemon juice,
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.480]   or I should say it's some lemon juice and water
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:51.240]   or lime juice and water,
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.680]   be careful because you can actually become hypoglycemic,
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:58.260]   for the very same reasons that lemon juice and lime juice
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.640]   can blunt blood glucose
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.480]   when your blood glucose levels are moderate to high.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.960]   You can also reduce blood glucose levels even further
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.700]   when blood glucose levels are low.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:10.120]   Now that's lemon juice and lime juice there,
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:14.160]   but we can't say that has to do with acidic things generally.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.080]   And just as a side point,
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.920]   many of you have probably seen in the store,
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:21.380]   so-called adjusted pH waters or foods and drinks
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.960]   that are supposed to adjust your pH.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:23.880]   Hate to break it to you,
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.440]   but your pH is very tightly regulated
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.900]   throughout your brain and body.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.640]   You do not want this to change.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.760]   It is entirely impossible, at least in any safe way,
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.960]   that you would become "more alkaline"
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.360]   by ingesting an alkaline water or something like that.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.120]   It is true that the pH, your alkalinity and acidity
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.840]   varies in different compartments in your body.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.220]   That's important.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:48.180]   Unless you are hemorrhaging or vomiting
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:50.680]   or there's something badly wrong with you health-wise
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.760]   and you're in a really dire circumstance,
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.780]   you don't want big shifts in your body pH
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.220]   and your body has all sorts of ways
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:59.360]   of buffering against changes in pH.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:02.400]   So I encourage you not to fall on the,
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.040]   or hop on the bandwagon of adjusting pH
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.680]   and becoming less acidic and that kind of thing.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.740]   When you ingest lemon juice or lime juice,
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.500]   the mechanism by which it blunts blood glucose
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.240]   is probably twofold.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.160]   One is probably through the post-ingestive effects
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.520]   of glucose in the gut,
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.800]   meaning the way in which sugars are interacting
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:26.300]   with neurons and other components of your gut circuitry
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:30.440]   to impact things like gastric emptying time,
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:34.100]   to impact things like the firing of those neuropod cells
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:35.800]   and their signaling to the brain.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.080]   But almost certainly it has something to do also
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:43.240]   with the perception of sour taste on the tongue.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:45.260]   We didn't go into this too much today,
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:49.380]   but you of course don't just have sweet taste receptors
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:51.220]   in your mouth, you also have bitter taste receptors,
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:53.040]   you have salty taste receptors,
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.320]   you have sour taste receptors in your mouth
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.480]   and of course that means your tongue and palate,
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.340]   and those are interacting.
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:03.500]   If you ingest a substance that's just sweet
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:07.920]   or mostly sweet, that causes a certain set of effects
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.980]   on your blood glucose, but also your brain,
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:12.600]   dopamine and the other neural circuits of your brain.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:15.740]   If you also ingest something that's sour,
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.800]   like lemon juice or lime juice,
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:21.820]   it adjusts the output of those neural circuits in your brain.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.580]   So again, we have a situation,
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.240]   we have two parallel pathways.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.800]   One that's post-ingestive coming from phenomenon
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.980]   within our gut, neurons,
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:31.620]   but also things like gastric emptying time,
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:35.380]   the clearance and the transfer of food
[01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.440]   and the conversion of food into particular nutrients
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:41.340]   and the circulation of glucose in your bloodstream
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:42.660]   and how it gets into the brain,
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:45.940]   but also simply by ingesting something sour,
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:49.080]   you are changing the way that sweet things
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:50.260]   impact your brain.
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:54.240]   And so I think it stands to reason that the lemon juice,
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.060]   lime juice effect is not going to be magic.
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:58.760]   It's going to have everything to do with the way
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.500]   that ingesting sour foods can adjust the taste,
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.580]   excuse me, can adjust the neural response
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.980]   to taste of sweet foods.
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:09.320]   And in fact, we know based on the beautiful work
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:13.100]   of Charles Zucker at Columbia Medical School,
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:14.840]   that that's exactly what happens.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:17.120]   They've measured the activity of neurons
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.620]   at various locations in the so-called taste pathways
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:20.460]   of the brain.
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.420]   And they found that when particular tastes
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.800]   like just sweet or just bitter or just sour
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.660]   evoke certain ensembles of neurons to fire
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:30.300]   in particular sequences,
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.800]   when sweet and sour are co-ingested,
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.500]   when bitter and sour are co-ingested,
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.500]   you get distinct ensembles,
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.980]   meaning distinct patterns of activity of those neurons.
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:43.220]   And of course, distinct patterns of downstream activity
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:44.380]   within the brain and body.
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:47.440]   So while it is still somewhat mysterious
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.640]   as to how exactly things like lemon juice and lime juice
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.700]   can reduce our blood glucose spikes
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.480]   when we ingest those with sweet foods
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.700]   or carbohydrate-laden foods or with big meals,
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.640]   you can use this as a tool with the understanding
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.620]   that there's a grounding in the biology
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.100]   of the way these circuits work.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:07.180]   Now, some of you have probably heard that cinnamon
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.320]   can be a useful tool for controlling blood sugar.
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:10.900]   And indeed that's the case.
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:14.080]   It's very clear that cinnamon can adjust the rate
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.460]   of glucose entry into the bloodstream,
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:19.880]   possibly by changing the rate of gastric emptying.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.820]   It might slow the rate of gastric emptying
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:26.180]   and thereby also reduce the glycemic index
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.200]   of particular foods.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.680]   So I suppose if I were going to eat a mango
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.580]   and I hadn't just done a bunch of hard training,
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.540]   I might sprinkle some cinnamon on it here.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.360]   I always enjoy kind of coming up with new ideas
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.160]   of ways that I can eat foods during these podcasts.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.920]   In any event, there's some debate out there.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.220]   If you look online as to whether or not
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:42.880]   Saigon cinnamon, Cassia cinnamon,
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.040]   or Ceylon cinnamon is best
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:49.580]   for purposes of blunting blood glucose spikes.
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:54.340]   But I think the, at least by my read of the data
[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:56.340]   and from what I found, it doesn't really matter
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:57.780]   provided it's real cinnamon.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.620]   And you have to actually look and make sure
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:01.780]   that it's real cinnamon because a lot of cinnamon
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.340]   that you buy is not real.
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:05.220]   I do want to provide a cautionary note
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:06.580]   about cinnamon however.
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:09.220]   Cinnamon contains something called Coumadin,
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:12.220]   which can be toxic at high levels.
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:15.620]   So you don't want to ingest more than about a teaspoon,
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.820]   maybe a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon per day
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:20.460]   because you'll start to exceed the threshold
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:23.340]   at which cinnamon could start to be problematic.
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:26.540]   But certainly if you're going to have a big meal
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:29.100]   or a meal that has a lot of sugar in it
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.580]   or a lot of carbohydrate laden foods
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:34.060]   and you don't want an increase in blood glucose,
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.920]   you could put cinnamon in a beverage,
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.220]   you could put cinnamon on food
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:41.540]   in order to blunt that blood glucose increase,
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:42.780]   reduce the glycemic index
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:44.660]   by way of reducing gastric emptying time.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:47.120]   Again, just making sure that you don't get out past
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.980]   that one and a half teaspoons per day
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:51.380]   'cause you really don't want to start dealing
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.300]   with any of the toxicity related to Coumadin.
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.540]   So we've talked about lemon juice and lime juice
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:57.160]   and cinnamon, these are kind of commonplace
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.160]   in many kitchens.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:03.040]   Then of course we can venture into the more esoteric
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.840]   or I would say the more advanced tools
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.680]   for adjusting sugar intake.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:11.900]   And the one that comes to mind is of course berberine.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.560]   Berberine is a derivative of tree bark
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.140]   and is a very, very potent substance
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:18.300]   for reducing blood glucose.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:22.460]   So much so that is on par with metformin or glibenclamide
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.400]   which are prescription drugs specifically used
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.380]   to reduce blood glucose.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:30.580]   So using berberine is a serious step,
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:32.940]   you should absolutely talk to your doctor about it.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:34.300]   I know of a number of people that use it
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:37.700]   to lower blood glucose when they eat really large meals.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.640]   I know the number of people that are using it
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.540]   to get to some of the other effects of metformin
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:46.840]   that people have discussed things like activating
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.280]   or tapping into the so-called AMPK pathway, reducing mTOR.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:54.020]   These are people that are aiming their activities
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.940]   at increasing longevity,
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:58.020]   a somewhat controversial approach still
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:00.660]   but I know many people are doing it.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:03.100]   It is true that if you ingest berberine
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:05.420]   your blood glucose will plummet.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:08.060]   And I point that out because I've actually tried it before,
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:11.660]   it gave me brutal headaches and I felt really dizzy
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.740]   and I felt like I couldn't see straight
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:15.620]   and actually I couldn't see straight.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.460]   Why did it do that?
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:18.540]   Well, it made me hypoglycemic,
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.800]   it actually drove my blood glucose down too far.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.280]   And the reason it did that is that I took berberine
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:25.780]   on an empty stomach.
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:27.500]   I know some people can tolerate it.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:30.940]   I would say be very cautious about ingesting berberine
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:34.160]   on an empty stomach or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.620]   unless you really know what you're doing
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:36.940]   and you have a medical professional
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:38.640]   to kind of guide you through that.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.620]   If I took berberine along with a very large meal
[01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:45.740]   that include a lot of carbohydrates,
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:47.660]   I can recall the days in which Costello and I
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.820]   would eat a couple of pizzas
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.900]   and then we might get ice cream, that kind of thing.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:55.740]   Then I felt perfectly fine on even up to 750 milligrams
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:57.380]   or a gram of berberine.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:59.260]   It has the kind of unique property
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:02.140]   of making you feel not overwhelmed
[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.520]   by the amount of blood glucose increase
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.340]   that you're experiencing from eating a big meal.
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:08.520]   I don't quite know how else to describe it.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.140]   It's almost as if you can keep eating
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:10.980]   and eating and eating.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:15.580]   And of course you have to protect your gastric volume, right?
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:17.400]   I mean, you only have so much space in your stomach
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.100]   to ingest food.
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.820]   I wasn't using it to gorge on food.
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:21.700]   I just heard about it.
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:23.080]   I was interested in experimenting with it.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.720]   I don't have any chronic blood sugar issues.
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.580]   But again, when I took it on an empty stomach,
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:31.400]   it made me hypoglycemic on a low carbohydrate intake,
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.500]   hypoglycemic, not a good experience.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.820]   And again, an experience I think to avoid
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:40.460]   but provided there's a lot of glucose in your bloodstream.
[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:44.020]   And certainly if you are of the experimental type
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:45.780]   or you're trying to regulate blood glucose,
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:47.500]   berberine might be a good option.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:49.540]   But again, talk to your doctor.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:51.220]   It does have some other interesting effects
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:53.580]   in terms of lowering total cholesterol
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:55.600]   that are research supported
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.460]   of reducing insulin a little bit.
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.400]   Well, that's not surprising.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.420]   If you reduce blood glucose,
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:01.640]   you're going to reduce insulin
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.040]   because of course insulin manages blood glucose
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.460]   in the bloodstream.
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:06.960]   So I would place berberine
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.260]   and of course metformin and glibenclamide
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:12.540]   in the kind of the heavy hitting potent tools
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.920]   for regulating blood glucose.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.800]   Now, this is an episode not about sugar per se,
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:20.660]   but sugar viewed through the lens of the nervous system.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.060]   And what's interesting about berberine,
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:25.300]   metformin, glibenclamide and related substances
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:28.780]   is that some of the effects are of course
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:31.060]   on gastric emptying or buffering blood glucose
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:33.820]   within the bloodstream, et cetera.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:37.280]   But there appear to also be some neural effects
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:40.840]   of having chronically low glucose
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.520]   or blunting blood glucose through things like berberine.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:45.880]   And some of those neural effects
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.880]   include longstanding changes in the hormonal cascades
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:53.360]   that are the consequence of having low blood sugar
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.700]   and thereby changes in the neural circuits
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.860]   that manage blood glucose overall.
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:00.220]   The simple way of saying this
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:03.800]   is that by maintaining low to moderate blood glucose,
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.520]   either by not ingesting heavily carbohydrate-laden foods,
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:09.160]   so here I'm speaking to the low carb
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:10.740]   and to the ketogenic types,
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:12.880]   or by blunting blood glucose
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.600]   through things like metformin or berberine,
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.420]   even if ingesting carbohydrates, maybe even some sugars,
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:21.660]   over time it seems that there's a adjustment,
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:24.900]   what we call a homeostatic regulation of the neural circuits
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:26.680]   that control things like sugar craving.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.740]   And indeed, some people report
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:31.680]   feeling fewer sugar cravings over time.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:34.900]   Now, I didn't use berberine for a very long period of time.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:36.520]   I've never used metformin.
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.120]   I have experienced a somewhat odd but welcome phenomenon
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.880]   of with each progressive year of my life,
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.720]   I have fewer and fewer sugar cravings.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.960]   Why that is, I don't know.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:49.400]   I suspect it might have something to do with my sleep,
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.240]   and I'll talk about that in a few minutes.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.080]   But if you're going to explore berberine
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.120]   or metformin or otherwise,
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.040]   in addition to working with a doctor,
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:58.680]   I think you should understand why you're doing it, right?
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:01.760]   I think that many of the effects can be quite potent.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.100]   They can happen in both the immediate term,
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.820]   in terms of regulating blood glucose,
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.240]   they can send you hypoglycemic if you aren't careful.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:12.300]   They can also cause longstanding changes
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.000]   to the neural circuitry that regulates blood sugar over time,
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.920]   some of which might be welcome changes, right?
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.000]   Reduce sugar cravings, for instance.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.660]   And if you're really, really serious
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:25.360]   about modulating blood glucose through things like berberine,
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.840]   the typical dose range, again,
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.520]   is anywhere from half a gram to 1.5 grams daily.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:33.200]   That's the typical dosages that have been explored.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:37.560]   And there are some other substances like sodium cuprate,
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:40.120]   which are known to augment the effects of berberine
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.200]   via the AMPK pathways.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.160]   They basically can increase the ability for berberine
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.320]   to have its glucose-lowering actions.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:49.800]   But that, of course, is getting into the really potent,
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:51.600]   what I would call sharp blade tools
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.560]   for controlling blood glucose.
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.820]   And listen, anytime you're dealing with blood glucose,
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:00.100]   you are dealing with the brain's preferred source of fuel.
[01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:00.940]   And anytime you're dealing
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:03.280]   with the brain's preferred source of fuel,
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.780]   you have to be especially cautious
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:07.000]   about depriving the brain of what it needs.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.240]   So whether or not you're low-carb, high-carb,
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:12.400]   keto, vegan, carnivore,
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.020]   these substances like berberine are very, very potent,
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:16.680]   and you need to take them seriously.
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:19.960]   There is yet another tool for controlling sugar cravings
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:23.720]   and the neural circuits that regulate sugar craving
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:26.280]   and its downstream consequences.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:30.220]   And this tool is what I would call a high-performance tool,
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:33.840]   but it's one that you probably didn't suspect,
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.980]   and that's sleep.
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:38.660]   I've done extensive episodes about sleep,
[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:41.980]   and we actually have an episode called Master Your Sleep.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:44.440]   You can find that episode easily at HubermanLab.com.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.000]   It's available in all the various formats,
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.880]   YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera,
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.660]   and provides a lot of tools.
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.620]   And on social media, I provide a lot of tools.
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:53.340]   Often we have a newsletter that provides tools
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.740]   on how to maximize sleep.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:01.160]   What is the role of sleep in sugar metabolism, sugar hunger,
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:04.620]   and the way that the brain regulates those things?
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:07.240]   Well, there's a really exciting study
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.940]   that came out just last year.
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:11.920]   This study was published in the journal Cell Report,
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:14.080]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.080]   And the reason I love this study so much
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:17.440]   is it involved having people,
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.200]   so yes, this was done in humans,
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:20.520]   sleep in the laboratory.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.560]   That's not unusual.
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:22.720]   There's a sleep lab at Stanford.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.380]   There's sleep labs elsewhere.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:27.740]   But what they did was they actually measured
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:30.220]   from the breath of these people
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:34.520]   and they extracted from their breath the metabolites
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.760]   that would allow them to understand
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.980]   what sorts of metabolism was occurring
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:42.140]   in these people's bodies at different phases of sleep.
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:44.160]   And this is a really remarkable study.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.640]   They actually did this every 10 seconds
[01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:48.760]   throughout the entire night.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.840]   So in little tiny 10 sec bins,
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.420]   meaning at very high resolution,
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.640]   they could evaluate what is the metabolism in the brain
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.640]   and body that people experience as they go from REM sleep,
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:00.740]   rapid eye movement sleep, to slow wave sleep and so on.
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:03.520]   And I'll go deeper into the study again in the future
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.760]   because it's so interesting and I think so important.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:09.400]   But what they discovered was that each stage of sleep
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:12.400]   was associated with a very particular signature pattern
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.100]   of metabolism and particular phases of sleep
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.580]   are associated with sugar metabolism
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:20.460]   or more with fat metabolism
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.160]   or more with other aspects of metabolism.
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.180]   And the reason why I think this study is important
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:28.580]   to discuss in the context of today's discussion
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:32.000]   about sugar in the brain is that many people
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]   have experienced the effects of disrupted sleep
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:36.920]   on their appetite.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.980]   And in particular, it's been reported
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:40.800]   that when people are sleep deprived
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.640]   or the quality of their sleep is disrupted,
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.760]   that their appetite for sugary foods increases.
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.580]   Now that was always assumed to be due
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:52.980]   to some metabolic need that was triggered
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:55.540]   by the sleep deprivation or by the poor sleep.
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:56.740]   But in reading over this study,
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:59.080]   some of the more important points made by the authors
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.660]   relate to the fact that, well,
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:03.520]   sleep is known to have incredibly important effects
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:05.880]   on brain and body for a variety of systems,
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.840]   immune system, neural functioning, et cetera.
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.840]   This very organized sequence of particular forms
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:14.840]   of metabolism being active
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.520]   during particular phases of sleep,
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.880]   which are very, very well orchestrated as we know,
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.600]   slow wave sleep and REM sleep being orchestrated
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.580]   in 90 minutes, so-called ultradian cycles
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:24.720]   and so on and so forth,
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.160]   is thought to perhaps set up the brain and body
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:32.360]   to be able to regulate itself in the waking hours.
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:35.080]   And therefore, when people are sleep deprived
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:38.760]   or deprived of certain forms or states within sleep,
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:42.020]   such as rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:43.920]   that it creates a disruption
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:46.620]   in a particular set of metabolic pathways.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:48.740]   Now, we don't want to leap too far from this study
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:50.600]   to sugar metabolism and the neural circuits
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.680]   controlling sugar metabolism, but I will say this.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:58.920]   If you look at the sum total of the data on obesity
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:01.880]   or on type two diabetes or on metabolic syndromes
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.520]   of any kind, you almost always see disruptions in sleep.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:09.240]   Now, some of those could be due to sleep apnea
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.960]   caused by even just the size of somebody's neck
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.400]   or the weight of their body.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.240]   In other words, we don't know the direction of the effect.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.000]   Metabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep,
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.740]   which disrupt metabolic syndromes.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.800]   And indeed, the authors point out quite appropriately
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.380]   that they don't understand the direction of the effects
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:28.140]   that they observe either.
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:32.320]   But there is now a plethora of data pointing to the fact
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.480]   that getting quality sleep each night
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:37.280]   helps regulate not only appetite,
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:39.720]   but also the specific forms of metabolism
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:42.140]   that drive specific appetites.
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:46.920]   So the takeaway is while there are extravagant
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.940]   and potent and interesting ways to regulate blood glucose,
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:53.160]   everything from cinnamon to lemon juice to berberine
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.140]   to sodium caprate to behavioral tools
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:58.660]   to the mere understanding of how the direct
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:02.000]   and indirect pathways go from the gut to dopamine, et cetera.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.340]   If you're not establishing the firm foundation
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:09.840]   of proper metabolism, all of those things
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.960]   are going to be sort of rearranging deck chairs
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.880]   on the Titanic as it's sometimes described.
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:17.240]   So we can't overstate the importance
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.260]   of getting regular sufficient amount of high quality sleep
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:22.600]   at least 80% of the time,
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.960]   not just for sake of immune system function,
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.240]   for clear thinking, et cetera,
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.160]   but also for properly regulating our metabolism,
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:32.040]   including our sugar metabolism.
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:33.560]   Thank you for joining me for this discussion
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:34.920]   about sugar and the nervous system
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.720]   and how they are regulating each other
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.900]   in both the brain and body.

[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:13.400]   at any level that you like.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.840]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab on Instagram
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:17.280]   or Twitter, please do so.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.040]   There I cover science and science-based tools
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.660]   that sometimes overlap with the content of the podcast,
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:25.720]   but often is distinct from the content of the podcast.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:28.040]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.800]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, I discussed supplements.
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.040]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.320]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.140]   One issue with supplements is that
[01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:38.280]   if you're going to take them,
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.320]   you want to make sure that they have
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:41.040]   the absolute highest quality.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.960]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.520]   That's T-H-O-R-N-E because Thorne is partnered,
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:48.920]   for instance, with all the major sports teams
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.320]   and the Mayo Clinic.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.920]   There's tremendous trust in the fact
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.640]   that Thorne supplements contain the specific amounts
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.120]   of supplements that are listed on the bottle
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.360]   and that the quality of the ingredients they include
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:01.320]   are of the very highest standards.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.840]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.060]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:10.240]   and you can get 20% off any of the supplements listed there.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.560]   Also, if you navigate further into the Thorne site
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.720]   through that portal, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:18.360]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.280]   that Thorne makes.
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:20.600]   Also, if you haven't yet signed up
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:23.600]   for the Huberman Lab Neural Network newsletter,
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:25.520]   it's a semi-monthly newsletter
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:28.320]   that includes summaries of various podcasts.
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.120]   It has some actionable protocols.
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.440]   It's completely cost-free.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.200]   You simply provide your email.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.080]   We have a very clear privacy policy.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.400]   We do not share your email.
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:38.560]   If you want to get the newsletter,
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.320]   you can go to hubermanlab.com.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.200]   Just go to the menu.
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:42.400]   You can find the sign up there.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.640]   Easily, you can also see some examples
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:47.340]   of previous newsletters without having to sign up at all.
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:49.500]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:51.380]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:53.960]   [upbeat music]
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.020]   you
