[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.620]   Today, we are discussing MDMA,
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.960]   sometimes referred to as ecstasy or molly.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.540]   MDMA stands for methylenedioxymethamphetamine.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.560]   That's right, you heard the word methamphetamine in there.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.840]   And MDMA has properties similar to methamphetamine,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.460]   but also properties that are very distinct
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.160]   from methamphetamine.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.160]   Just as a side note,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.300]   methamphetamine is a commonly used drug of abuse.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.080]   It is an illicit drug,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.520]   and it produces some of the greatest and fastest increases
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.640]   in the neuromodulator dopamine
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.800]   of any available drugs on the street or in the clinic.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.640]   And believe it or not,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.360]   methamphetamine is prescribed as a prescription drug
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.480]   in some very limited clinical uses.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.440]   MDMA, methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.900]   has properties similar to methamphetamine
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.060]   in that it powerfully promotes the release of dopamine,
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.080]   and it is a stimulant.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.160]   And yet it also powerfully controls the release of serotonin,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160]   and in doing so, makes MDMA a distinct category of compound
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.240]   from either classic psychedelics like psilocybin or LSD,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.800]   which largely work on the serotonin system,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.960]   and tend to produce mystical experiences.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.680]   And it's also distinct from pure stimulants
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.580]   such as methamphetamine,
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.720]   because MDMA, by producing big increases
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.740]   in both dopamine and serotonin,
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.080]   acts as what's called an empathogen.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.660]   It actually can increase one's sense of social connectedness
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.520]   and empathy, not just for other people, but for oneself.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.700]   And in that way, MDMA is commonly used
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.440]   as a recreational drug,
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.740]   but also is now being tested
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.000]   and is achieving incredible early results in clinical trials
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.840]   for its use as an empathogen for the treatment of PTSD
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.120]   in clinical therapeutic settings.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   I want to be very clear that at this point in time,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.520]   June, 2023, MDMA is still a schedule one drug.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.000]   That is, it is highly illegal to possess or sell
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.700]   in the United States.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.460]   And today we are going to talk about
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.480]   some of the path to legality that's underway.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.920]   We are also going to talk about the history of MDMA
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.800]   and why it became illegal.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.040]   And we are going to talk about the key difference
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.740]   between recreational use and therapeutic use
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.560]   and the important components of the studies exploring MDMA
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.240]   in the clinical setting for the treatment of PTSD.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.420]   So during today's discussion,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.100]   we will talk about what MDMA really is,
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.220]   how it works at the level of neurons,
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.500]   which brain circuits it activates and deactivates.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.240]   And in doing so, you will come to understand
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.060]   why it is so exciting as a treatment for PTSD.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.200]   We will also, of course, talk about the results
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.120]   of these clinical trials using MDMA
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.820]   for the treatment of PTSD.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.600]   They are incredibly exciting.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.800]   In fact, the field of psychiatry has never before seen
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.680]   the kind of success in treatment of PTSD
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.080]   with any other compound that they are seeing and achieving
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.040]   with the appropriate safe use of MDMA.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.120]   And when I say appropriate,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.740]   that means in conjunction with nine therapy sessions.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.260]   So this is an area that really deserves some time
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.040]   for us to discuss because again,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.300]   there is a distinct difference between the recreational
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.060]   and the therapeutic use of MDMA.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.720]   We will also talk about the toxicity of MDMA.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.500]   This is a very important issue
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.980]   because many of you have perhaps heard that MDMA,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.100]   quote unquote, puts holes in your brain
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.340]   or kills serotonin neurons or kills dopamine neurons.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.620]   And indeed MDMA, because of its similarity
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.420]   to methamphetamine, which is highly neurotoxic,
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.780]   MDMA can be neurotoxic.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.660]   However, there are ways to use MDMA therapeutically
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.220]   that avoid its toxicity.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.080]   And yet there are still questions about its toxicity
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.380]   and its long-term effects, both after acute use,
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.940]   meaning just one to three times, as well as chronic use,
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.160]   meaning people who have taken it many, many times.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.340]   We'll talk about the spacing between sessions of MDMA.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.820]   We will talk about dosages.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.520]   We will also talk about things that people do
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.600]   and that can be done to offset
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.220]   some of the potential toxicity of MDMA.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.540]   So by the end of today's discussion,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.500]   you will have a thorough understanding of what MDMA is,
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.080]   what it isn't, what is known about what it does,
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.160]   what is known about what it doesn't do,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.120]   as well as some of the still outstanding questions
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.620]   about MDMA that remain to be resolved.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.380]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.020]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.980]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.640]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.280]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.400]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.280]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.240]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.260]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.360]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.040]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress over two years ago,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.180]   and since starting to sleep on a Helix mattress,
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.220]   I've had the best sleep of my life.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.920]   And that's because the mattress is tailored
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.060]   to my unique sleep needs.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.100]   Everybody has unique sleep needs.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.600]   And if you go to the Helix website,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.120]   you can take a very brief two-minute quiz.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.640]   We'll ask you questions such as,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.920]   do you tend to sleep on your back,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.680]   your side, or your stomach?
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.480]   Are you somebody who tends to run warm or cold
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.700]   during the night, et cetera?
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.460]   Perhaps you don't know the answers to those questions.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.300]   That's fine.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.840]   You can simply put that response.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.120]   And Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.540]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.840]   This is so critical because sleep is the foundation
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.880]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.480]   And when we are sleeping well and consistently,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.540]   everything in life goes that much better.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.760]   And when we are not sleeping well consistently,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.700]   everything suffers.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.980]   There's a ton of science to support those statements.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.420]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.000]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.580]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.340]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.460]   and you'll get up to $350 off all mattress orders
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.600]   and two free pillows.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.460]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.000]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.140]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.820]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.940]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.880]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.720]   The company was founded
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.820]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.480]   and everything about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.540]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.360]   Now, I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.300]   the visual system,
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.800]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.340]   has to contend with an enormous number
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.400]   of different challenges
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.060]   Roka understands those challenges
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.840]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.160]   so that you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.380]   Their eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.620]   for sports performance,
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.600]   and as a consequence, they are very lightweight,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.440]   which is great.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.940]   They also won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.520]   However, even though they were designed
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.620]   for sports performance,
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.780]   they now also include a lot of styles
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.460]   that are designed to be worn to work, out to dinner,
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.060]   essentially recreationally so that you could wear anywhere.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.620]   If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.020]   go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.140]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your order.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.780]   Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.020]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.820]   Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.900]   that increases blood ketones.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.240]   I know most people are familiar with,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.180]   or at least have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.500]   It's used for weight loss, it's used to control epilepsy,
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.020]   it's used for mental health reasons.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.080]   However, most people, including myself,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.820]   do not follow a ketogenic diet.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.020]   Nonetheless, increasing your blood ketones
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.100]   can improve the function of your brain
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.620]   and the function of your body,
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.260]   and that's because ketones are preferred use of fuel
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.800]   for the brain and body.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.700]   So even though I follow an omnivore diet,
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.000]   that is I'm not in a ketogenic state,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.480]   I use Ketone IQ to increase my blood ketones
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.800]   prior to doing preparation for podcasts,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.820]   or writing grants, or doing research,
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.140]   as well as prior to workouts,
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.500]   especially if I want to work out fasted,
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.600]   I'll take some Ketone IQ to increase my blood ketones,
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.520]   which gives me a lot of energy during workouts,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   or during bouts of cognitive work,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.980]   even if I haven't eaten in the preceding hours.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.800]   It really increases my focus and my energy levels.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.380]   If you'd like to try Ketone IQ,
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.760]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.760]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman to save 20%.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.260]   Let's talk about MDMA.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.420]   MDMA, or ecstasy, is a fascinating compound.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.860]   And I say fascinating from the perspective
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.380]   of its chemical structure, which is highly unusual.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.840]   I say fascinating because it has an incredible set
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.440]   of subjective effects in terms of how it makes people feel,
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.140]   and it has a fascinating history.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.380]   So let's just briefly start with the history of MDMA.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.400]   MDMA was synthesized by the drug company Merck
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.340]   in the early 1900s, but it actually was never applied
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.500]   to any particular clinical use,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.820]   and it wasn't really explored much
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.700]   in any laboratories at all.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.220]   And then it was later rediscovered
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.820]   by a guy named Alexander Schulgen,
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.820]   who was a bit of a renegade drug chemist,
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.500]   who was designing different drugs
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.900]   for the purpose of understanding
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.180]   their subjective effects on humans.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.580]   So there's a long history of Schulgen designing drugs.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.500]   He was, after all, a chemist.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.020]   And then taking those drugs himself,
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.580]   and then if he liked the effects of a particular drug,
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.900]   or rather, if he thought
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.820]   that it had potential clinical utility,
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.480]   he would give it to his wife.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.420]   Then she would give him her notes about those drugs,
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.360]   and then they would share them with their friends.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.960]   And it was a small group of friends
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.540]   who consisted of therapists and physicians.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.000]   So this was a really underground kind of operation.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It was technically not illegal when it started,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.420]   because MDMA wasn't illegal when it started,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.820]   but over the several decades
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.900]   that Schulgen and his wife and this group
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.580]   were doing this kind of exploration,
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.100]   MDMA did become illegal,
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.580]   and he fell under, let's just say, scrutiny by the DEA.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.260]   Now, here's the important thing to understand
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.300]   about MDMA and its history.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.940]   First of all, MDMA is a synthetic compound.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.260]   As far as we know, it does not exist anywhere in nature.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.340]   So unlike similar compounds, such as mescaline,
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.060]   because MDMA and mescaline are very similar
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.380]   in their chemical properties,
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.480]   and to some extent, their subjective properties,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.680]   unlike mescaline, which can be found in the plant kingdom,
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.220]   or LSD, which comes from ergot,
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.500]   or psilocybin, which of course
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.980]   can be found in magic mushrooms,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.540]   MDMA is a unique chemical in that,
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.540]   again, as far as we know, only exists in its synthetic form.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.580]   It is human-made.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.440]   And as we get into the chemical effects
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.180]   and the subjective effects of MDMA
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.820]   a little bit later in the episode,
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.620]   I think you'll understand why it is such a unique
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.640]   and to some extent exciting compound
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.880]   from the perspective of clinical treatment.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.980]   Put differently, there's really no other compound
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.940]   that we know of in nature
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.040]   or in the pharmaceutical industry shelf
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.240]   or options of drugs that are prescription drugs
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.260]   that produce the kinds of effects that MDMA does.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.700]   And by the way, if you're interested
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.820]   in the story of Alexander Shulgin
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.820]   and the drugs he synthesized
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.640]   and the group that he built up to take these drugs
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.140]   and try them and actually had several members of this group
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.540]   using these drugs in therapy with their patients
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.540]   for a long period of time,
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.520]   both before and after MDMA became illegal.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.080]   There's a wonderful book called PIKAL.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.220]   That stands for P-I-K-H-A-L.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.140]   PIKAL is the title of the book which Shulgin wrote,
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.900]   which describes his discovery of MDMA.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.220]   I confess it also describes the synthesis of MDMA.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.120]   And for that reason was a book that for a long time
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.840]   was not available, but is now available again
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.340]   in audible form and in printed form.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.980]   PIKAL stands for phenylethylamines, I have known and loved.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.500]   Phenylethylamines is the category of drug
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.740]   for which MDMA belongs to.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.780]   And it's a long book, but a very interesting one
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.580]   both from the perspective of understanding
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.380]   the history of MDMA and what MDMA is
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.680]   and the effects that it produces.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.860]   But it's also an interesting book
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.060]   because it will teach you a lot
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.420]   about the history of the pharmaceutical industry,
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.380]   the war on drugs in the United States
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.420]   and the interaction between illegal drug exploration
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.380]   and drugs for clinical treatment of psychiatric challenges.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.940]   So right now this is a very important issue
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.680]   because MDMA is currently granted breakthrough status,
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.640]   which means it's now something that scientists
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.540]   and clinicians can study
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.300]   if they have authorization to do that.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.680]   It is, as I mentioned earlier, still a schedule one drug,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.300]   so it's illegal to possess
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.640]   unless you are one of these scientists
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.280]   who has been granted permission to study it
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.660]   in the clinical setting or the laboratory setting.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.980]   And right now we are on the cusp of MDMA becoming legal,
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.100]   but again, it is not yet legal.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.840]   And this is something I'm going to touch back on
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.440]   a few times during today's episode.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.700]   Later, for instance, when we talk about
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.800]   the potential toxicity of MDMA,
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.960]   its ability potentially to kill neurons,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.620]   and the neurons it has been hypothesized to kill
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.240]   are neurons of the serotonin and dopamine type,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.740]   so this is something you would not want.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.100]   Let's just recall that killing off of
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.940]   or death of dopamine neurons
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.940]   is the underlying basis for Parkinson's disease,
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.120]   which is a movement disorder
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.800]   where people have difficulty generating smooth movements
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.420]   and in very severe form, they can't move at all.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.540]   They sort of become locked in to some extent,
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.180]   and it also has cognitive effects,
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.980]   so you don't want to lose dopamine neurons,
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.660]   and loss of serotonergic neurons
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.180]   is known to impact mood negatively,
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.420]   mood regulation negatively, et cetera.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.000]   The story of MDMA and its potential neurotoxicity
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.980]   comes slam right up against this issue of legality,
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.920]   and what we'll get into a little bit later is that
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.500]   there has been a sort of race in the scientific community
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.080]   consisting of two groups,
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.920]   one set of groups trying to establish the toxicity of MDMA
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.960]   so that it does not become legal again,
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.160]   and another group trying to establish the utility
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.220]   and the lack of toxicity in MDMA
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.020]   so that it does become legal again
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.720]   for the treatment of PTSD.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.560]   So even though the story, PCAL,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.260]   relates to events that took place
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.780]   largely in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s,
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:21.840]   right now MDMA and its toxicity or lack of toxicity,
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.100]   its legality or lack of legality are really key issues.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.600]   So as you're listening to this,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.360]   I'm giving you a real-time blow-by-blow
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.620]   of what led up to where we are now,
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   but we will also want to think about
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.520]   how what's happening right now,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.360]   including the description of these data on MDMA,
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.100]   may or may not impact the potential legal status of MDMA.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.460]   Okay, so what is MDMA?
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.920]   MDMA is 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.640]   but unless you're a chemist,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.560]   that's not going to mean much to you, nor should it.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.520]   MDMA has some very interesting properties,
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.640]   the first of which is that methamphetamine component,
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.400]   which, because it's a methamphetamine
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.760]   and acts like other amphetamines,
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.080]   what it does is it blocks the reuptake of dopamine
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.220]   from neurons after dopamine is released.
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.840]   So for those of you that heard the episode
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.640]   that I did on drugs to treat ADHD,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.660]   I discussed the biology and mechanisms
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.320]   of drugs like Adderall and Vyvanse,
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.040]   which basically are either combinations of amphetamines
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.380]   or single types of amphetamines
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.360]   that have either a quick release or a long release.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   Now, MDMA, because it has this methamphetamine component,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.900]   prevents the reuptake of dopamine,
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.220]   and in doing so, creates net increases in dopamine.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.940]   So for those of you that don't have a background
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.740]   in neurobiology, let me just briefly explain.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.000]   I'll make this very simple.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.360]   Neurons or nerve cells release chemicals
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.620]   at their sites of communication, which are called synapses.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.240]   Synapses are little gaps between neurons,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.780]   and what happens is the neurons spit out
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.960]   these little spherical balls,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.040]   which we call vesicles or vesicles,
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.240]   depending on where in the world you live.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.600]   They'll either be called vesicles or vesicles,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.740]   and those little vesicles contain neurotransmitter
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.080]   or what's technically referred to as a neuromodulator.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.360]   Dopamine is a neuromodulator.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.380]   It can modulate the activity of other neurons.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.100]   It can either increase or decrease
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.900]   the activity of other neurons.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.020]   Now, at the end of the neuron,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.580]   what we call the axonal bouton, okay?
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.580]   Axon is kind of the wire component of the neuron
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.420]   that can reach to another site in the brain
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.420]   and then release the neurotransmitter
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.660]   or neuromodulator there.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.300]   At those axonal boutons, which are the sites of release,
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.060]   the vesicles literally fuse with the edge of the neuron
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.060]   and vomit their neuromodulator out into the synapse,
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.140]   and then the neuromodulator, in this case,
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.180]   dopamine will bind to receptors on the postsynaptic side,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.540]   that means to another neuron,
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.580]   and then depending on how much binds
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.900]   and depending on what else is going on
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.140]   in that local neighborhood of neuronal connections,
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.780]   the neuron will either increase its neural activity
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.420]   and itself release neuromodulator
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.140]   or neurotransmitter someplace else,
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.780]   so sort of a chain reaction,
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.140]   or else it will suppress its activity
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.860]   and the flow of communication from one neuron
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.020]   to the next will be stopped, okay?
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.340]   So MDMA doesn't prevent the release
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.340]   of dopamine at the synapse, it does quite the opposite.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.540]   It actually prevents the sucking up
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.580]   of the dopamine that's been released
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.020]   and that does not bind to the receptors.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.180]   So basically what it does is it blocks these things
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.940]   called dopamine transporters,
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.300]   and the transporters are the things that suck back up
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.540]   the dopamine that's been released
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.760]   that has not bound to receptors.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.540]   So because it blocks that sucking up process,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.180]   there's more dopamine around in the synapse
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.260]   to hang out and then bind to receptors
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.420]   once some become available, okay?
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.220]   The other thing that the methamphetamine component
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.180]   of MDMA does, just like methamphetamine,
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.580]   is that it actually gets into
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.900]   what we call the presynaptic neuron,
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.940]   the neuron that releases the dopamine,
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.700]   and it interferes with the repackaging
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.100]   of dopamine into those vesicles.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.340]   Now you might think, oh, it interferes
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.460]   with the repackaging of dopamine into vesicles
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.420]   and therefore less will be released,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.020]   but actually what happens is as a consequence of that,
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.940]   a bunch of dopamine builds up in the presynaptic neuron
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.540]   so that when an electrical impulse comes down that neuron
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.740]   and dopamine is released,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.260]   a huge amount of dopamine is released.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.460]   And this is one of the characteristic properties
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.400]   of methamphetamine and of MDMA,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.260]   which is that it leads to enormous increases
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.300]   in the amount of dopamine released
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.300]   and the amount of dopamine that hangs around in the synapse
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.460]   and therefore it increases what we call dopaminergic tone
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.620]   or dopaminergic drive.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.040]   That's just a bunch of different ways
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.500]   to describe increases in dopamine.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.440]   Okay, so that's the main way that MDMA,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.500]   and by extension methamphetamine, increase dopamine.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.460]   However, MDMA is not just methamphetamine,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.260]   it's methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.820]   and it has another incredible property,
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.180]   which is that it doesn't just lead
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.780]   to huge increases in dopamine,
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.740]   it also leads to huge increases in serotonin.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.020]   And that's because there are other neurons
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.020]   that release serotonin and they have serotonin transporters,
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.860]   which are sometimes called Serts, S-E-R-T-S,
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.060]   serotonin transporters,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.860]   and they work very much in the same way
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.620]   that dopamine transporters do, right?
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:24.480]   They basically control the sucking back up of serotonin
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.940]   that's been released into the synapse
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.700]   and that has not bound to serotonin receptors
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.420]   on the other neurons yet,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.080]   and in doing so, allow more serotonin to hang out
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.380]   and have its effects as those receptors become available
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.180]   for serotonin to bind to them.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.700]   The other thing MDMA does is it also gets
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.340]   into the presynaptic neuron to impact the packaging
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.180]   of serotonin into something called
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.740]   the vesicle monoamine transporter for serotonin.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   And in doing so, it leads to a big buildup of serotonin
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.940]   in the presynaptic terminals
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.940]   and then massive increases in serotonin release.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.980]   Okay, so what we've got with MDMA
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.100]   is a really interesting compound.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.420]   Unlike methamphetamine or other amphetamines,
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   such as Adderall, Vyvanse, et cetera,
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.460]   that cause increases in dopamine by blocking reuptake
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.580]   and increasing release of dopamine, MDMA does that,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.020]   but it also does the same thing for serotonin.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.760]   And here's a really key point.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.380]   The increases in serotonin that MDMA creates
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.220]   are at least three times
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.180]   and maybe as much as eight times greater
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.180]   than the amount of dopamine release that MDMA causes.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.740]   But when you put those two things together,
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.060]   what you basically have is a drug
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.900]   that causes huge increases in dopamine
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.460]   and even bigger increases in serotonin.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.340]   And remember earlier when I said
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.740]   that MDMA is a purely synthetic compound,
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.020]   as far as we know, it does not exist in any plants
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.140]   or fungus or anything else in nature?
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.420]   Well, this is a very unusual circumstance
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.580]   of having big increases in dopamine
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.740]   and big increases in serotonin caused by the same compound.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.380]   And that combination of big increases in dopamine
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.480]   and big increases in serotonin
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.860]   are what lead to these highly unusual
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.080]   and yet what seem to be potentially clinically
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.900]   very beneficial effects of having people feel
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.520]   a lot of mood elevation and a lot of stimulation
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.740]   from the stimulant properties of the methamphetamine
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.260]   component, so that's the dopamine effect.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.440]   The dopaminergic tone goes way up.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.640]   So it's a stimulant.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.940]   People feel really alert.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.660]   They feel like talking a lot.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.500]   They feel very excited.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.980]   They feel a lot of positive motivation.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.560]   These are classic effects of drugs
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.140]   that promote the release of dopamine,
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.940]   including amphetamine, cocaine, et cetera.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.900]   But ordinarily that's not such a good thing
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.720]   because what happens is there's then a crash
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.040]   in the dopamine levels
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.260]   and then people feel depressed.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.140]   They feel lethargic.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.220]   They don't feel good at all.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.420]   MDMA seems to cause these increases in dopamine
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.860]   and all the accompanying effects I just described,
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.620]   but by also causing big increases in serotonin,
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.180]   it activates neural networks that are associated
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.980]   with feeling more socially connected.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.660]   In fact, we'll talk about data in a little bit
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.120]   where people have had their brains imaged
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.420]   while under the influence of MDMA.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.460]   And it's very clear that people who have taken MDMA
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:29.660]   look at faces that ordinarily they would rate as fearful
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.800]   and rate them as less fearful.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.740]   They see faces that are smiling
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.960]   and they rate those smiling happy faces
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.560]   as more positive than they would off the drug.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.300]   The big increases in serotonin
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.780]   create what we call a prosocial effect.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.800]   And that combined with the dopaminergic increase in mood
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.040]   and the stimulation effect creates this thing
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.220]   that we call an empathogen where,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.440]   and this is very important,
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.400]   the empathy isn't just for other people.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.080]   It's also for oneself
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.860]   and one's own experiences happening in the moment,
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.480]   as well as empathy for experiences from the past,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.940]   which as you can imagine could be very beneficial
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.780]   for the treatment of PTSD, okay?
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.820]   So hopefully the way I described the biology of MDMA
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.780]   makes some sense.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.440]   If you didn't get anything out of the description
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.720]   I provided except the understanding that MDMA is unusual
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.940]   in that it causes big increases in dopamine
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.280]   and even bigger increases in serotonin
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.360]   then you have more in your knowledge base now
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.320]   about MDMA than you need
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.480]   in order to understand the rest of our discussion.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.140]   Before we go any further,
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.040]   I do want to separate MDMA out from some other compounds
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   which are referred to as psychedelics.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:42.140]   And I recently did a podcast episode all about psilocybin
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.300]   and its therapeutic exploration
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.960]   and its chemical basis, et cetera.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.640]   You can find that like all episodes at Hubermanlab.com.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.120]   I also did an episode with expert guest,
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.160]   Dr. Robin Carthart-Harris,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.800]   who's at University of California, San Francisco,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.420]   who's pioneering a lot of the studies
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.760]   on the clinical application of psilocybin.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.480]   Psilocybin and LSD
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.480]   are mainly going to increase
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.560]   serotonin activation in the brain.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.840]   In fact, they very closely resemble serotonin itself
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.040]   and they activate what's called the 5-HT2A or serotonin,
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.540]   5-HT just stands for serotonin,
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.860]   the 5-HT2A receptor
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.640]   to create very mystical type experiences.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   They are considered classic psychedelics
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.060]   and are very introspective.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.260]   And as I described in those episodes
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.900]   are being explored extensively now
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.040]   for the treatment of major depression.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.360]   A different compound that's being used
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.260]   for the treatment of depression is ketamine.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.360]   I will do an entire episode all about ketamine.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.040]   Ketamine is actually a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker,
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.720]   NMDA receptor blocker,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.680]   that shouldn't mean anything to most of you,
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.600]   but it is a dissociative anesthetic, not unlike PCP,
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.960]   what used to be called angel dust on the street.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.880]   Ketamine is being used as a treatment for depression.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.380]   It is currently legal.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.320]   So unlike psilocybin and LSD,
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.560]   which are granted breakthrough status
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.040]   for the study of depression, but are not yet legal,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.220]   they are still illegal.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.360]   And of course, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   MDMA has breakthrough status, but is still illegal.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.240]   Ketamine is being used for the treatment of depression
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.760]   and it does so, as its name suggests,
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.300]   a dissociative anesthetic
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.280]   by creating a sense of dissociation from emotions, okay?
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.740]   Now I raised this distinction between psilocybin and LSD,
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.400]   which are mystical in their effects.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.280]   Ketamine, which is dissociative in its effects,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.680]   with MDMA, which is an empathogen
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.520]   or sometimes called an enactogen,
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.340]   but as an empathogen or an enactogen,
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.000]   it's creating more affiliation, it's affiliative, okay?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.420]   So it's a very distinct compound.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.160]   And I think this is important to understand
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.080]   because when we hear the word psychedelic,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.700]   a lot of people tend to lump together
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.120]   LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.820]   If you talk to researchers in these areas,
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.800]   they will tell you that MDMA
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.780]   really isn't that much of a psychedelic.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.340]   It's an empathogen with stimulant properties
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.680]   and it also has the serotonergic component
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.440]   that makes it an empathogen or an enactogen.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.520]   So MDMA is very different than the other psychedelics
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.720]   and my hunch is that over the next few years,
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.760]   we will stop talking about MDMA as a psychedelic
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.200]   because it does not tend to produce visual hallucinations
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.600]   or auditory hallucinations of the sort
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.580]   that classic psychedelics do.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.580]   And in general, it is more of a mood impacting drug
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.760]   than it is mystical, okay?
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.620]   So we'll get into some of the brain networks
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.120]   and which ones are activated
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.180]   while under the influence of MDMA,
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.220]   but I do think it's very important to segment out MDMA
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.140]   from the other so-called classic psychedelics
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.520]   and also segment it out from ketamine.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.040]   Thanks to some really terrific studies,
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.420]   both in animal models and in humans,
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.220]   we now understand a lot of what makes MDMA
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.880]   produce these incredibly unique effects.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.720]   And when I say unique,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   I mean unique from drugs like psilocybin
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.040]   and LSD and ketamine
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.120]   and from methamphetamine for that matter.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.320]   And it's really the combination of big increases in dopamine
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   and even bigger increases in serotonin
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.240]   that create a situation where people have more energy
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.160]   and yet despite having more energy,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.440]   they don't feel irritated.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.960]   They feel a lot of pleasure.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.800]   They seem to want to be in the state
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.340]   of having a lot of energy.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.620]   This will become important as we talk about anxiety
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.960]   and the anxiety symptoms of PTSD.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.540]   It also, because of the big increases in serotonin,
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.980]   produces a sense of emotional warmth
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.680]   towards others and towards oneself.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.560]   That's the empathogen component.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.880]   And for reasons that we still don't understand,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.360]   it seems to increase trust.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.680]   And the increases in trust turn out to be vital
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.280]   because as you will also learn later
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.640]   when we look at the clinical trials
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.000]   exploring MDMA for the treatment of PTSD,
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.780]   the major effect of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.460]   is not to cure PTSD,
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.660]   but rather to make the therapy,
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.420]   the talk therapy for PTSD much more effective.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.980]   This is a very important point.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.400]   In fact, so important I'm going to repeat it
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.520]   at least three times during today's episode.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.160]   MDMA taken on its own does not cure PTSD.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.860]   MDMA can augment or boost the effects
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.740]   of talk therapy for PTSD.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.420]   And it does that through the engagement
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.400]   of specific neural circuits.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.460]   But before we talk about what those neural circuits are,
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.100]   I want to emphasize that the increases in serotonin
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.100]   that MDMA produces seem to act on different receptors
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.420]   than the big increases in serotonin
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.300]   that LSD and psilocybin produce.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.220]   So if you listen to the episode that I did on psilocybin,
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.940]   we haven't done yet one on LSD,
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.520]   but the mechanisms are very similar for psilocybin and LSD,
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.620]   whereby psilocybin and LSD very closely mimic
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.300]   the molecule serotonin itself,
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.580]   but seem to have a more selective activation
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.020]   of just the so-called serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.940]   abbreviated 5-HT-2A.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.080]   And that leads to more interconnectedness
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.420]   between different brain areas,
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.520]   more consideration of new possibilities
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.580]   about events from the past, present, and future,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.660]   and also the opening of so-called neuroplasticity
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.620]   of rewiring of neural connections
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.660]   that persist long after the psilocybin
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.140]   or LSD effects have worn off.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.140]   Now, MDMA can activate the serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.500]   but it seems that it largely activates
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.920]   the serotonin 1B receptor.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.460]   Now, what does that mean?
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.420]   Activation of the serotonin 1B receptor
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:56.020]   seems to be what gives MDMA its very strong impact
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.860]   on the neural circuits of the brain
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.580]   that relate to trust and to social engagement,
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.780]   not just the willingness to engage socially
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.940]   and to confide in a therapist or another person,
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.820]   but the intense desire to do so.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.600]   And when I say intense desire,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.300]   that takes us back to the dopamine system.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.740]   Remember, dopamine, even though when increased in the brain,
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.100]   can increase our mood,
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.860]   it is largely responsible for increasing our sense
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.460]   of motivation and desire for something and to do something.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.580]   So the increase in dopamine that's created by MDMA
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.420]   seems to make people what I call forward center of mass.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.620]   They want to do something.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.340]   They're very motivated to do something.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.600]   And the increases in serotonin
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.460]   acting on the serotonin 1B receptor
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.540]   seems to be what creates this desire to bond
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.740]   or create trust or to have a discussion of real things,
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.980]   both things that are positive,
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.780]   but also to explore things that are difficult.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.220]   And this, I realize,
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.940]   is going to be a little bit of a mind bend
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.900]   for people to understand.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.100]   But one of the key things
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.660]   that quality MDMA therapy consists of
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.380]   is not just having a very good rapport
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.860]   and communication with a therapist
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.560]   that's guiding the PTSD treatment,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.540]   but also rapport and a willingness
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.500]   to engage in conversations with oneself.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.940]   And I think that most of us can relate to the fact
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.380]   that we have experiences, some of which are hard,
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.540]   some of which are great, and everything in between.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.060]   Trauma is, I believe, best defined
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.320]   by the words that a former guest on this podcast,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.860]   who's a world expert in trauma, Paul Conte,
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.220]   explained as trauma is an event
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.020]   that fundamentally changes the way that our brain works
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.180]   for the worse, okay?
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.220]   So not every bad event of our past is trauma,
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.060]   but events that change the way that we think,
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.840]   our emotional tone, or our behavior,
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.940]   in ways going forward that are not adaptive for us,
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.660]   they don't serve us well,
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.620]   either because they are highly distracting,
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.060]   or because they create anxiety,
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.340]   or because they disrupt sleep,
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.020]   or any number of different things
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.160]   that are maladaptive consequences,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.500]   that's what really defines trauma.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.460]   And when under the influence of MDMA,
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.580]   because of those parallel increases
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.700]   in dopamine and serotonin,
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.980]   people seem far more willing to both trust the therapist,
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.940]   that they're talking about that trauma with,
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.800]   but also to trust their own ability to, quote unquote,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.620]   go internal and think about the challenging thing or things,
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.980]   'cause oftentimes trauma can consist of many events,
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.180]   not just one event,
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.580]   and the thought patterns around that,
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.180]   and the context around that,
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.560]   and therein to be able to explore new possibilities
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.260]   to essentially rewire their relationship to that trauma.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.000]   So I promised that a little bit later,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.940]   we'll talk about the direct application of MDMA
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.660]   for the treatment of PTSD,
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.220]   but now I'd like to shift off of the chemical changes
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.820]   that MDMA produces and some of the subjective changes,
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.340]   these increases in trust and pleasure and energy
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.740]   and emotional warmth,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.980]   to some of the brain circuits that are activated
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.660]   and modified by MDMA use,
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.340]   and then we will explore the toxicity issue,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.680]   and then we will explore the clinical studies
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.540]   of which I can promise you are extremely exciting,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.580]   but until we understand the neural circuit phenomena,
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.320]   and of course, until we consider the neurotoxicity issues,
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.960]   I don't think those clinical findings can be appreciated
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.040]   in their full value.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.000]   But now I'd like to talk about what MDMA
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.800]   really does in the brain, both in the short term,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.100]   while someone is under the influence of the drug,
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.380]   and in the long term,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.180]   what sorts of neuroplastic or rewiring changes
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.700]   does MDMA produce, and how can those be beneficial
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.040]   or perhaps not beneficial?
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.560]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.480]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.940]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.300]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.200]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.880]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.100]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.700]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.780]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.760]   once or usually twice a day
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.100]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.360]   for gut health.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.460]   Our gut is very important.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.020]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.760]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.180]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.820]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.660]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.500]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.060]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.980]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.860]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.300]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.760]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.160]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.140]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.440]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.740]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.020]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.420]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.120]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.500]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.460]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.900]   So in order to understand what MDMA does to the human brain,
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.940]   we need to take a step back
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.100]   and really define the sorts of experiments
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.640]   that one could do.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.020]   So for instance, you could take a person
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.620]   who's never ingested MDMA and put them into an fMRI machine,
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.900]   which is functional magnetic resonance imaging,
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.860]   put them into the fMRI machine,
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.120]   and just have them sit there with their eyes closed,
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.500]   what we would call resting functional connectivity
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.760]   or resting state functional connectivity,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.600]   and simply look at how interconnected
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   certain brain areas are, which brain areas are active,
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.740]   which brain areas are less active at rest.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.640]   This is an important thing to do,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.060]   not just to provide a baseline for understanding
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.160]   what the drug MDMA will subsequently do,
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.500]   but also because it addresses
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   what's called the default mode network.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.100]   The default mode network or DMN
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.700]   is the network that is active in our brains
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.980]   when we aren't really attending
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.220]   to anything specific outside us,
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.660]   and we're not trying to think about anything specific
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.620]   or accomplish anything specific.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.740]   It actually relates to our sense of imagination
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.180]   and daydreaming.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.660]   It has a lot to do with our self-referencing,
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.100]   what we're thinking about ourselves.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.260]   This may come as no surprise,
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.700]   but if you're just sitting there on the bus
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.260]   or around the dinner table
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.100]   and you're not paying attention to what's going on,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.660]   in large part, your brain is in this default mode network,
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.160]   and you're thinking about yourself, okay?
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.420]   So we can get a sense
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.500]   of what the default mode network activation is.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.320]   We can get a sense of which brain areas
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.640]   are more or less active,
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.580]   simply by putting somebody into an fMRI machine.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.780]   Then of course, you could give somebody MDMA
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.880]   while they are in the fMRI machine
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.660]   and see how the activation
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.620]   of different brain networks changes.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.460]   And then of course,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.220]   you could analyze how the default mode networks
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.340]   and other brain networks change in the days and weeks
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.420]   and even years after the drug has worn off,
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.500]   so-called neuroplasticity effects,
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.100]   what changed in a permanent or pervasive way.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.980]   Okay, so that's sort of one basic paradigm
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.100]   for exploring the effects of drugs like MDMA on the brain.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.700]   The other way that you can explore the effects
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.220]   of MDMA on the brain
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.860]   is to ask people in the general population,
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.380]   hey, who out there has taken MDMA?
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.060]   How many times have you taken it?
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.700]   And come on into the laboratory
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.620]   and we will image your brain
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.420]   and compare people who have,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.860]   for instance, taken MDMA zero times
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.460]   to people who have taken MDMA one time or five times,
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.740]   or believe it or not,
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.140]   there's some studies sitting right here in front of me
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.560]   on my desk of people who have taken MDMA
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.940]   more than 200 times and ask the same sorts of questions,
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.900]   which brain areas are more or less active?
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.700]   Those studies have been done as well.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.140]   And of course, one can do studies
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.740]   where you give people different dosages of MDMA
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.840]   as well as giving people MDMA
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.300]   and then giving them specific stimuli,
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.220]   meaning not just asking them to sit there
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.060]   in the fMRI scanner with eyes closed,
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.840]   looking at the resting state functional connectivity,
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.580]   but also how the brain responds
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.340]   to the presentation of happy faces or sad faces
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.260]   or images of oneself or even images that recall memories
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.300]   of traumatic events and so on.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.060]   So fortunately, all of those sorts of studies
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.020]   have been done in humans
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.420]   and there are also a large number of studies
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.800]   in animal models exploring how the social activity
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.840]   of laboratory mice changes
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.220]   when they are under the effects of MDMA.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.980]   There are even studies, believe it or not,
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.900]   on the effects of MDMA in cephalopods.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.900]   Cephalopods include octopuses as well as cuttlefish
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.620]   and other aquatic animals that are known
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.340]   for having complex behavior.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.980]   Some people believe that the cephalopods
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.320]   are extremely intelligent.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.620]   The obsession with cephalopods
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.060]   is something that really intrigues me.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.320]   I actually used to have cuttlefish in my laboratory.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.060]   We did not put them on MDMA,
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.580]   but there is a study that's been published
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.540]   in the journal Current Biology.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.340]   It's a cell press journal, excellent journal.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.060]   This is from Gould Dolan's laboratory
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.420]   at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.220]   showing that if you give octopuses MDMA,
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.260]   they like to spend more time with other octopuses
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.640]   than they do if they are not on MDMA.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.740]   And that might sound like kind of a playful experiment
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.300]   just done in order to entertain oneself
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.780]   and the octopuses, perhaps.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.300]   But actually in that study,
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.420]   they identified the serotonin transporter in octopuses
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.460]   and showed that it has a lot of homology similarity
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.180]   to human serotonin transporter receptors.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.580]   And so what that really speaks to is the fact
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.300]   that the prosocial effects of MDMA
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.700]   that are observed in mice and in humans and in octopuses
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.060]   all have a common basis,
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.140]   which is the activation of more serotonin release
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.900]   in particular brain networks.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.940]   Okay, so that interesting study on octopuses aside,
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.500]   I think what most of us are interested in
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.940]   is how MDMA impacts the brain.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.500]   And so I'm going to spell out the three major ways
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.220]   in which MDMA changes the activation of the brain
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.660]   in the short and long-term.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.540]   And here I'm pooling across a number of different studies.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.860]   But one of the key sets of studies in this area
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.780]   comes from what I consider very beautiful work
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.100]   of Harriet DeWitt.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.360]   Harriet DeWitt runs
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.300]   the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.800]   in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.040]   at the University of Chicago.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.700]   And her laboratory has a long history
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.020]   of giving people certain drugs in very specific dosages
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.500]   and then measuring their effects on the brain
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.200]   using different types of imaging, including fMRI.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.120]   And one particular study that I'll highlight
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.660]   is entitled Effects of MDMA on Sociability
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.440]   and Neural Responses to Social Threat and Social Reward.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.820]   So what this study looked at is how MDMA impacts
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.140]   people's perceptions of others' emotional expressions
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.720]   on their face.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.780]   What they found is that when people are on MDMA,
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.080]   their response to threatening faces
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.340]   or other threatening stimuli is reduced.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.160]   And it's reduced in a very specific way,
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.740]   which is reductions in activity of the amygdala.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.340]   The amygdala is a structure
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.380]   that some of you may be familiar with.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.060]   It is known to be involved in the threat detection systems
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.460]   or networks of the brain.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.300]   It is sometimes called the fear area of the brain,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.180]   although I want to caution people
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.420]   against assigning any one particular subjective experience
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.160]   to any one particular brain area.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.920]   The amygdala is actually a complex.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.120]   It's actually called the amygdaloid complex
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.920]   and has a lot of different sub areas.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.300]   And it's involved in a lot of things
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.340]   besides fear and threat detection.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.020]   Nonetheless, when people are under the influence of MDMA
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.480]   and you show them a face that is grimacing
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.900]   or would otherwise be rated as quite threatening,
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.060]   they tend to rate it as less threatening.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.580]   In addition, they tend to respond to happy faces
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:33.460]   or even slightly happy faces as more kind
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.700]   or more generous or happier than they would
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.060]   when they are not on MDMA.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.340]   Again, the faces that are being shown
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.120]   are not of people on MDMA.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.340]   That would be an interesting experiment,
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.840]   but that's not what they did here.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.100]   What's happening here is people are being given MDMA
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.420]   and then they are rating in a subjective way
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.540]   the friendliness or the level of threat
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.920]   that they detect in these facial expressions.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.380]   And of course, they have extremes
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.660]   of friendly and threatening,
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.700]   but then they also grade them, right?
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.100]   They titrate them so that they also have mildly threatening
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.620]   and mildly happy faces, et cetera.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.060]   So everything from a grin to a smirk to a giant smile,
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.420]   everything from a sort of somebody looking
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.260]   a little bit askance at somebody to really wide-eyed
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.380]   and looking angry like they're going to attack you
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.920]   and things of that sort.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.220]   So what's discovered in the study is that MDMA
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.500]   has a bi-directional effect
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.220]   on our perception of others' emotions,
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.340]   making people more likely to rate something as positive
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.880]   if it's initially positive or even a little bit positive
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.900]   and less likely to rate a threatening face
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.860]   as more threatening.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.860]   Now, one thing I have not mentioned thus far
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.860]   are the dosages of MDMA used in this and in other studies.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.300]   And fortunately, despite the studies
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.620]   that we're going to talk about,
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.380]   using a lot of different types of people,
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.620]   different ages, different sexes, so male and female,
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.300]   located in different parts of the world even,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.720]   some with PTSD, some not with PTSD, et cetera,
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.740]   there's been fairly tight dosage control
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.340]   of MDMA in these studies.
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.260]   It's not perfectly matched from study to study,
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.660]   but it's pretty darn close,
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.340]   which makes interpreting results across studies
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.660]   a lot easier for me and therefore for you.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.220]   The typical dosages of MDMA used in these neuroimaging
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:24.280]   studies and in the clinical studies of PTSD
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.220]   that we're going to talk about later
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.000]   range anywhere from 0.75 milligrams per kilogram
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.360]   of body weight to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.120]   So for somebody like me, I weigh 220 pounds,
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.420]   that's 100 milligrams.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.800]   1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.320]   would therefore be 150 milligrams in a single dose, okay?
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.800]   A dosage of one milligram per kilogram of body weight
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.200]   would mean 100 milligrams for my 100 kilograms, okay?
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.120]   Somebody lighter than 100 kilograms
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.480]   would obviously take less MDMA in one of these studies.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.080]   But in general, the range of MDMA that's been explored
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.700]   is 0.75 to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.300]   The exception being in the clinical studies
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.000]   that we'll talk about a little bit later,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.440]   there's a tendency to explore both an initial dose
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.960]   of 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.520]   So again, for a 100 kilogram person,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.480]   that'd be 150 milligrams or so.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.340]   And then a so-called booster of half that amount,
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.980]   about 90 minutes to two and a half hours into the session.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.040]   So another 75 milligrams later.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.960]   And I should point out that there is not always
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.720]   the inclusion of the so-called booster.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.240]   And in some cases, lower doses of MDMA,
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.420]   such as the 0.75 milligrams per kilogram dosages are used.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.220]   Why am I getting so into the details of dosages?
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.880]   Well, if we are going to talk about toxicity of MDMA,
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.600]   we absolutely have to talk about dosages.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   Because like any drug, the toxicity of MDMA
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.280]   does scale with the dosage that's applied,
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.680]   not just the frequency of MDMA use.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.040]   We hear a lot about that.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.080]   Someone has taken MDMA one time or four times or 200 times.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.720]   We hear about frequency of use,
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.780]   but rarely do we hear about the specific dosages
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.640]   that are taken in any one particular session.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.240]   So when we talk about the subjective effects
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.920]   or the brain networks that are activated
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.460]   when people take MDMA, in general,
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.320]   we're talking about dosages somewhere
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.000]   between 0.75 milligrams per kilogram of body weight
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   and 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.400]   Although typically you're going to see studies,
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.940]   both clinical and more research explorative,
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.360]   using anywhere from one to 1.5 milligrams
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.880]   of MDMA per kilogram of body weight.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.200]   So that's important to highlight.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.840]   I told you about the subjective effects
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.780]   of MDMA engaging the responses of people's faces,
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.240]   but I didn't tell you about the brain areas
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.760]   that are responsible,
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.120]   except for the reduction in amygdala activity.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.780]   Now, one of the key features of PTSD
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.640]   seems to be that there is a heightened connectivity
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.060]   between the amygdala and a brain area called the insula.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.000]   The insula is a brain area that's very important
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.480]   for something that's called interoception.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.980]   Interoception is one's perception of our feelings,
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:23.560]   both pure sensations, but also our emotional states
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.280]   and our feelings of wellbeing or lack of wellbeing
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.080]   for everything from our skin inward, okay?
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.860]   So that's interoception.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.600]   You actually can interocept now,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.400]   even though you're always interocepting a little bit,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.420]   you can interocept now to a great degree
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.440]   if you were to, for instance, close your eyes
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.820]   or simply focus on the contact points between your body
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.980]   and any surface that you happen to be contacting.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.300]   So maybe the backs of your legs against a chair
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.620]   or your feet against the floor
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.920]   or the bottoms of your shoes or sandals.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.800]   Your nervous system is constantly sensing
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.380]   those contact points,
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.880]   but normally they're not under your conscious awareness
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.660]   unless you direct your interoceptive capacity to them,
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.300]   which is just fancy nerd speak for saying,
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.160]   you normally don't notice what's going on
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.020]   from your skin inward unless you focus on it.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.380]   That focus is interoception.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.380]   It can be about the fullness of your gut.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.500]   It can be about how happy or sad you are.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.660]   It can be about how tired or alert you happen to feel,
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:21.820]   but that's interoception.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:25.020]   And it is distinctly different from exteroception,
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.480]   which is your ability and tendency to focus on things
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.100]   beyond the confines of your skin.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.020]   So this could be visual attention, auditory attention.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:37.780]   It could be paying attention to events like birds flying by,
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.500]   whether or not your Uber is showing up,
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.620]   these kinds of things.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.480]   And we are always in a balance,
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.200]   a push-pull of interoception and exteroception.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.960]   The insula is a brain area that is absolutely critical
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.840]   for interoception, so much so that it has a map
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.220]   of the complete body surface, including our internal organs.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:48:00.040]   In other words, if you put somebody into an fMRI machine
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.280]   or you were to record from the insula with electrodes,
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.000]   as has been done in humans many times now
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.580]   during the course of neurosurgery for other purposes,
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.560]   what you would find is that if you stimulate neurons
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.040]   in one end of the insula, the person will say,
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.780]   "Oh, you know, I feel something going on in my gut
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.800]   and on my left side."
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.880]   And then as you were to march that stimulation
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.920]   across the insula, you would find that they would now
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.820]   be paying attention to their legs or just to one leg
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.760]   or to their whole body or to the sensations in their face
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.600]   or their head.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.760]   There's a systematic map of interoception in the insula,
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.080]   and there are direct connections between the amygdala
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.660]   and the insula, and the amygdala,
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.860]   despite getting this reputation as just being a fear center
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.800]   or a threat detection center, is actually part
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.080]   of a much larger set of networks that include inputs
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.520]   from the hippocampus, an area of the brain that's involved
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.680]   in memory formation and storage, and what is observed
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.600]   is that people who have PTSD tend to have greater
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.680]   or rather stronger connections between the amygdala
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.540]   and the insula than is normally observed in people
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.880]   who do not have PTSD, okay?
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.400]   So there seems to be heightened input
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.100]   from the threat detection centers of the brain
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.200]   to this area of the brain, the insula that is responsible
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.880]   for our sense of interoception,
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.780]   which provides a logical explanation for why people
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:25.780]   with PTSD often will feel the memory or sense the discomfort
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.560]   or just feel agitation or even other types
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.380]   of bodily sensations like back pain,
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.400]   or just perhaps just a sense within their body
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.420]   that's more generalized.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.500]   It doesn't even have to be pain,
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.900]   doesn't even have to be negative,
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.540]   but that's associated with the negative memory
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:44.180]   of some traumatic event or series of events, okay?
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.120]   So this is a really interesting brain network
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.860]   that I should mention exists in everybody,
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.580]   but that in people with PTSD seems
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.360]   to have heightened connectivity,
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.760]   and those brain networks can be revealed
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:00.700]   by putting people with PTSD into functional imaging machines,
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.800]   getting them to recall a traumatic event,
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.160]   or even looking at the resting state of connectivity
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.080]   between the amygdala and the insula.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.700]   So those experiments have been done,
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.540]   and what's also been done is to give people 1.5 milligrams
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:16.040]   per kilogram of MDMA and to look at the connectivity
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.180]   between the amygdala and the insula
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.200]   and between the hippocampus, the amygdala and the insula.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.400]   And so what's observed over time in people
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:28.080]   that have been given MDMA and, this is a very important and,
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.920]   and have done therapy for PTSD,
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.760]   both before, during, and after the drug,
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.300]   there's a weakening of connections
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.220]   between the amygdala and the insula,
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.660]   and that scales very directly
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.300]   with the relief of symptoms from PTSD.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.740]   So this is really exciting because it's one thing
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:51.420]   to see a brain network get activated or inactivated,
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.620]   or you say, okay, in one person,
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.100]   a certain connection between threat centers
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.860]   and the interoceptive centers of the brain was,
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.300]   let's say, arbitrary units.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.540]   Let's say it was level eight out of 10 for that person, right?
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.580]   These things are normalized for a particular person.
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.660]   And then after taking MDMA and doing PTSD therapy,
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.260]   it was five out of 10 or four out of 10.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.940]   That's a good experiment,
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.480]   but what's far more powerful is to observe that
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.380]   in that patient or that person,
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.380]   and then to see a change that's perhaps less dramatic.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:26.300]   So a shift from eight out of 10 to seven out of 10
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.100]   in another person, and to see less shift
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.420]   in brain connectivity in the same network.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.940]   And then perhaps in the person
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:37.520]   that went from full-blown PTSD to full remission of PTSD,
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.740]   something that, believe it or not,
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.620]   has been observed in single sessions with MDMA,
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.580]   if that person demonstrates an even greater reduction
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.180]   in the connections between the amygdala and the insula,
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.300]   well, then that gives even more confidence
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.380]   that this connection between the amygdala and the insula
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.260]   is actually perhaps causally related
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.220]   to the reduction in symptoms of PTSD.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.540]   Or even if it's just correlated
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.300]   with reduction in symptoms of PTSD,
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.860]   the fact that the degree of reduction
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:10.020]   of connection of this circuit scales with the reduction
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.060]   in clinically relevant symptoms,
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.500]   that's a very powerful finding
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.460]   because it moves things away from pure correlation of,
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.180]   oh, this brain area is active or less active over time,
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:22.420]   and this person has more or fewer symptoms of PTSD,
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.240]   to something that starts to look like a mechanistic
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:29.080]   and logical framework for understanding PTSD,
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.980]   as well as the effects of MDMA,
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:34.100]   and for understanding how changes in the brain
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.380]   underlie relief from PTSD.
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.620]   Okay, so again, even if you just could grasp the idea
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.340]   that you have a brain area, the amygdala,
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.740]   that's involved in threat detection,
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.780]   and it provides inputs to another brain area
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.520]   called the insula, which is involved in this thing
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.340]   called interoception, and that reductions in those connections
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.980]   between the amygdala and the insula scale with
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.980]   or correlate with reductions in PTSD symptoms
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.660]   as a consequence of people taking MDMA.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.300]   So if you have that under your mental belt,
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.980]   I promise you, you understand far more
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.140]   about how MDMA impacts the brain in the short and long term
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.380]   than 99.9% of people out there.
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.840]   However, it's also important that you understand
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.420]   a few other things that MDMA does to the brain,
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.300]   as well as what it doesn't do to the brain.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   First of all, classic psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD,
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.800]   as I mentioned earlier, are known to create
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.980]   more lateral connectivity between different areas
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.500]   of the so-called neocortex.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.080]   And these are long-lasting changes
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.560]   that are thought to underlie both some of the relief
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.740]   from major depression,
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.080]   but also some of the enhanced creativity
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.180]   and some of the other things that have been observed
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.720]   with psilocybin treatment.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.360]   And again, if you're interested in psilocybin treatments
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.320]   and psilocybin itself, please check out the episode
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.180]   I did on psilocybin and the guest episode
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.640]   with Dr. Robin Carthart-Harris.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.520]   Those episodes, like all other episodes
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.980]   of the Huberman Lab podcast can be found
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.020]   at hubermanlab.com.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.620]   It's a fully searchable site.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.620]   You can put keywords into the search function.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.980]   It will take you to specific timestamps.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.100]   Every episode is timestamped so you can navigate
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.180]   to topics of particular interest to you.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.380]   Feel free to go there and listen to those episodes
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.060]   about psilocybin.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.940]   MDMA, by contrast, does not seem to produce
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:13.900]   long-lasting increases in lateral connectivity
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:15.300]   between those same brain networks,
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.680]   probably because it impacts different serotonin receptors.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.100]   It does, however, seem to change resting state
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.500]   functional connectivity within these limbic structures
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.820]   like the amygdala and related structures
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.960]   that are associated with threat detection.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.920]   Now, this is interesting,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.440]   and it actually was highlighted very nicely
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.820]   in a study I'll provide a link to in our show note caption,
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.560]   which actually has Dr. Robin Carthart-Harris
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.400]   as the first author.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.760]   So not only has he done incredible work on psilocybin
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.560]   and LSD and DMT and ayahuasca in his laboratory,
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.980]   but also on MDMA.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.940]   And the particular study I have in mind here
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:52.700]   showed that people who take MDMA
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.860]   at more or less the dosage that we talked about earlier
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.580]   report marked increases in positive mood,
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.960]   as well as decreased blood flow
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.600]   to the amygdala and hippocampus.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.660]   So again, these threat detection centers of the brain
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:08.580]   and brain areas associated with memory.
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:10.460]   And those changes are seen
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.000]   both while under the influence of MDMA
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.080]   and afterwards when the brain is simply at rest.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:19.920]   So it really does appear that MDMA creates neuroplasticity
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.740]   that changes the overall level of activation
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.560]   of these threat detection networks
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.920]   and their connections to memory systems
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.780]   in a way that's pervasive over time
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.040]   and that doesn't require any particular probe
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.280]   with a negative stimulus.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.220]   Translated to English,
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:39.420]   what that means is that during the MDMA session,
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.700]   people report feeling less threatened,
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.420]   more pro-social towards others,
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.940]   more empathic towards others and themselves.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.620]   And then after the session,
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:51.940]   they have less of a threat response to memories
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.220]   that before the session were more troubling.
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.500]   And those changes in the brain do seem to be pervasive.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   So there are both short-term and long-term effects of MDMA,
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.160]   all of which point in the direction
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.740]   of lowered levels of threat detection,
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.620]   heightened levels of positivity,
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.020]   pro-social components of the brain,
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.860]   more active threat detection centers of the brain,
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.340]   less active.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.540]   Now, earlier we talked about MDMA as a drug
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.500]   that potently increases dopamine
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:23.300]   and even more potently increases serotonin,
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:28.100]   largely acting through this serotonin 1B receptor.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.220]   Now, without getting into too many more details
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.460]   before moving on to issues of toxicity around MDMA,
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.620]   I do want to touch on what I think is perhaps the finest
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.720]   of the animal model studies of MDMA
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.940]   that explored which brain networks
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:46.020]   and which chemical, that is serotonin or dopamine,
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:50.420]   is responsible for, say, the motivational components of MDMA
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.680]   versus the pro-social effects of MDMA.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.240]   And then it also raises a really important point,
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.800]   which I haven't mentioned yet in this episode,
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.300]   which is the role of oxytocin,
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.180]   something that many of you have perhaps heard of.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.700]   The paper that I'm going to describe
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.980]   is from the laboratory of Dr. Robert Malanka.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.840]   He's a colleague of mine at Stanford University
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.740]   School of Medicine, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.800]   He is both a pioneer and luminary
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.240]   in the field of neuroplasticity,
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.580]   of how the brain wires and forms memories
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.560]   and can change itself over time in response to experience,
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.880]   as well as the study of drugs of abuse,
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:29.000]   as well as the study of drugs like MDMA
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.020]   and now additional compounds
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:35.720]   that can provide therapeutic support in certain conditions.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.700]   The study, which I will provide a link to
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.120]   in the show note caption,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   is entitled Distinct Neural Mechanisms
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.880]   for the Pro-Social and Rewarding Properties of MDMA.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.380]   And I'm just going to summarize
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:46.600]   the major results of this study.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.460]   It's a study that was done on mice,
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:50.240]   and I realize that a lot of people will hear that
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.300]   and think, ah, what relevance does that have to humans?
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.180]   But when thinking about the effects of dopamine and serotonin
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.440]   in the types of circuits
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.600]   that we've been talking about thus far,
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.540]   these circuits that are subcortical, as we refer to them,
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.180]   so these are limbic circuits, these are hypothalamic circuits,
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.100]   these are what are called mesolimbic circuits,
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.020]   these are all names for circuits that are highly conserved
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.120]   between mice and humans.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.780]   And so results in mice really do translate quite well
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.340]   to results in humans,
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.260]   at least in so far as the effects of MDMA
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:22.000]   and which neurochemicals are involved is concerned.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.460]   So what they found in this study,
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.460]   using a huge array of beautiful techniques,
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.660]   such as inactivation of specific brain areas,
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.840]   activation of specific brain areas,
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.360]   drug antagonist to prevent oxytocin function,
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.240]   or drug antagonist to prevent specific receptors
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.700]   involved in the serotonin pathway,
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.220]   lots and lots of tools in their toolkit.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:46.100]   What they found is that MDMA causing the release of dopamine
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.200]   is what really establishes the rewarding effects
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.300]   of an experience.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.080]   This isn't really a surprise.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:57.940]   We've known that MDMA, just like cocaine or methamphetamine
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.880]   or Adderall for that matter, or Vyvanse for that matter,
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.380]   creates big increases in dopamine that tend to couple
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.360]   an experience with a sense of reward
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.700]   and lead to changes in the neural circuitry
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.500]   that make the animal or human more likely
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.900]   to seek out that same experience again.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.080]   Okay, these are the rewarding
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.620]   or sometimes called reinforcing properties of dopamine
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.140]   that take place in the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.140]   If you want to learn about mesolimbic reward pathways
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.740]   and dopamine and how they control everything
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.140]   from your level of motivation
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:29.580]   to your tendency to procrastinate
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.180]   or overcome procrastination,
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.540]   I've done two episodes about dopamine.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.080]   You can simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.940]   put dopamine into the search function,
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.200]   and you'll find at least two episodes on that topic.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.200]   And you'll also find a number of different tools
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.860]   related to how one can better regulate
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:47.140]   their own patterns of dopamine release
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.900]   for sake of motivation, et cetera.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:53.140]   So MDMA is increasing dopamine to increase reward
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:55.020]   to a particular experience.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:55.960]   What's the experience?
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.700]   Well, this paper beautifully parses the fact
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.860]   that it is serotonin release
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.700]   within a structure called the nucleus accumbens,
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.620]   which is part of the reward pathway,
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:09.420]   which is rewarding the experience of social interaction.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.860]   They do this by putting mice in arenas
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.700]   where they have the option
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.980]   of either spending time with other mice
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.260]   or not spending time with other mice
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.400]   and blocking the activation of certain brain areas,
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.860]   and again, using drug antagonists, et cetera.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.740]   And what they find is that it really is the activation
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.380]   of the serotonin 1B receptor
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:27.900]   in the nucleus accumbens by MDMA
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.620]   that leads to this prosocial effect of MDMA.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.920]   So that's really nice to know
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.480]   because there's always been this conundrum of,
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.400]   okay, psilocybin and LSD are basically like serotonin.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.580]   They activate the serotonin 2A receptor.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.540]   MDMA has this huge serotonergic component,
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.820]   tons of serotonin released when one takes MDMA,
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.960]   but very different effects in the short and long term,
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.220]   very different subjective effects,
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.380]   very different patterns of change activity in the brain
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.920]   in the short and long term.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.100]   Well, that's because MDMA is activating
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.060]   the serotonin 1B receptor, not the serotonin 2A receptor,
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.900]   and it's doing so in a completely different set
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.180]   of brain networks as is LSD and psilocybin.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.940]   So what happens when an animal or a person takes MDMA
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:15.300]   is that social connection is strongly rewarded
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.700]   and reinforced, making social connection more likely
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.540]   after the drug wears off.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.100]   Now, that's one component of social connection,
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.940]   but in addition, people who take MDMA
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.040]   in the clinical therapeutic setting
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.220]   for the treatment of PTSD often report feeling more empathy
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.120]   and compassion for themselves during the session,
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.940]   but also for long periods of time,
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.040]   maybe even indefinitely after the session.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.720]   So it really seems that the addition
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.380]   of this huge release of serotonin by MDMA
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.780]   on top of the release of dopamine
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.640]   sets in motion two parallel circuits,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.140]   one for rewarding something, anything,
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.460]   that's the dopamine component.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.640]   And then fortunately,
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.960]   because the increase in serotonin caused by MDMA
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.340]   increases empathy and sociability for and with others,
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.620]   but also for oneself,
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.640]   the motivation that's reinforced,
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.960]   that's wired into the brain seems to be a motivation
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.780]   to perceive others as more kind,
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.400]   but also to be kinder to oneself.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.940]   Now, I realize that for some of you
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.780]   who are listening to this, you're probably saying,
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.600]   well, of course, right?
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.820]   You know, serotonin is pro-social and dopamine is motivation,
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.000]   so you put the two together
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.620]   and people become more motivated to be social
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.580]   and kinder to themselves.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:36.880]   Ah, but it didn't necessarily have to be that way, right?
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.060]   It is very hard to go from a statement
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:44.900]   like drug A produces effects B, C, and D
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.960]   to neurochemicals B, C, and D
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.980]   cause motivation and sociability,
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.980]   and therefore, when you take that drug,
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.500]   you're going to get all of that stuff.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.420]   In fact, we have to go back to our understanding
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:00.300]   that MDMA, despite causing a big increase in serotonin,
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.540]   also causes huge increases in dopamine,
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.520]   and it does so with this molecule that is methamphetamine.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.240]   Now, methamphetamine is not known to be a pro-social drug.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.740]   In fact, the study I just referred to,
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.580]   as well as some human studies,
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.820]   have explored how the application of methamphetamine,
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.620]   so not MDMA, but pure methamphetamine,
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.100]   impacts social interactions,
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.080]   and what it does to social interactions is very profound.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.420]   It dramatically reduces one's tendency
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.020]   to engage in social interaction.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.680]   So this really speaks to the polypharmacology,
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.500]   as it's called, of MDMA,
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.580]   the fact that serotonin and dopamine are released together
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.900]   has distinctly different effects
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.840]   than if just dopamine or just serotonin is increased,
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.620]   so much so that it's worth taking a step back
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.480]   and talking about another class of drugs
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.960]   which dramatically increases serotonin,
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.600]   which are the SSRIs,
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.500]   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:02.940]   SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, Prozac, as well as Zoloft,
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.340]   and of course, there are many other SSRIs out there,
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.340]   citalopram, et cetera,
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.760]   they block the reuptake of serotonin
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.100]   and thereby lead to net increases
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.260]   in the amount of serotonin,
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.960]   and yet those drugs are not known to create
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.740]   even close to the same sorts of effects as MDMA.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:25.360]   In fact, there have been human and animal studies showing
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.840]   that if you give somebody an SSRI
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.200]   prior to them taking MDMA,
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.280]   you actually block the prosocial
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.200]   and empathogenic effects of MDMA.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.800]   Now, you might say, why in the world would that be?
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.080]   Aren't these drugs just increasing serotonin
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.200]   and the increase in serotonin is prosocial, et cetera?
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.960]   Ah, well, that speaks to the complexity
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.460]   of all this polypharmacology
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.200]   and the fact that it's really the activation
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.000]   of serotonin at particular receptors,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.300]   in this case, the serotonin 1B receptor,
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.040]   in particular brain areas.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.160]   In this case, the nucleus accumbens,
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.740]   a brain area associated with motivation and reward
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.240]   that largely explains the effects of MDMA
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.120]   in making people and animals,
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.640]   and octopuses included for that matter,
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.040]   more prosocial and more empathic towards themselves.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.040]   It's not just an issue of raising
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.960]   the levels of one neurochemical.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   It's really about raising levels
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.440]   of a particular neurochemical
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.420]   acting in particular receptors, in particular brain areas.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.520]   And in the case of MDMA,
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.680]   the fact that there's also dopamine increased
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.760]   in those very same brain areas, right?
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.040]   I don't think I mentioned this before,
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.360]   but the nucleus accumbens
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.820]   is part of that mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.820]   that is essentially establishing a reward
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.500]   for whatever is happening at the moment.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.640]   So the way to conceptualize MDMA
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.460]   and its effects on the brain,
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.080]   both subjectively and mechanistically,
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.040]   is that it's an empathogen
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.840]   for which empathy and social connection
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.800]   is very strongly reinforced
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.900]   while under the influence of the drug,
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.300]   and in a way so intense and powerful
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.280]   that those neural networks get stronger
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.840]   and persist in being more active
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.200]   for long periods of time after the drug has worn off.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.800]   I'd like to just take a brief break
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.660]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.080]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.300]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:21.940]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.760]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.920]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.440]   are critical to the function of all the cells in your body,
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.100]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.280]   also called neurons.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.920]   And we now know that even slight reductions
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.120]   in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.720]   can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.240]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.360]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram, of sodium,
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.860]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.920]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.040]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.820]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.080]   And while I do any kind of physical training
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.600]   and after physical training as well,
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.400]   especially if I've been sweating a lot,
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.240]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.700]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna,
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.380]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.360]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.940]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,

[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.680]   Now, one of the things that's been explored
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.420]   in both the animal literature and the human literature
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.900]   is that MDMA doesn't just increase dopamine
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.500]   and doesn't just increase serotonin,
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.440]   but it also profoundly increases levels
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.840]   of oxytocin release in the brain.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.160]   Now, oxytocin is considered what's called a neurohormone
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.240]   because it acts as both a neurotransmitter,
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.700]   or I guess if we were going to be really specific,
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.040]   we'd say a neuromodulator
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.840]   because it tends to modulate the activity
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.080]   of a bunch of other circuits, and a hormone.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.800]   How can we say it's a hormone or a modulator or a transmitter?
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.920]   Well, hormonal effects tend to be effects
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.420]   that act not just locally,
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:02.360]   but on many sites within the brain and body as well.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.300]   And oxytocin is known to do that as well as to work locally.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.020]   So that's what we call a neurohormone.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:11.260]   It activates neurons and is associated with neural networks
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.400]   related to pair bonding, both between parent and child,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.180]   both mother and child, and father and child,
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:21.340]   or caretaker and child, not just biological parent,
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:26.080]   as well as bonding between friends, bonding between lovers.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.820]   And it's thought to actually be involved in the process,
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.940]   that is the painful process of breaking of bonds
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:37.000]   when people are no longer available to us as caretakers
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.160]   or as partners, either by way of breakup,
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.800]   death, departure, et cetera.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.500]   In fact, there are even data suggesting
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.100]   that humans can have strong oxytocin responses
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.220]   to their pets, in particular dogs,
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.140]   and their dogs can have strong oxytocin patterns of release
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.000]   in response to their owners.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.640]   I think for any dog lovers or dog owners,
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.180]   certainly includes me, I'm raising my hand,
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.420]   that comes as no surprise.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.240]   Anyone that's ever had to put down a dog
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.580]   or has lost a dog and here, no disrespect to the cat owners,
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.000]   but I'm just referring to the studies
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.540]   that have been done on humans and dogs,
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:13.280]   you can certainly relate to the incredible pain
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.600]   of that loss.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.220]   Oxytocin is thought to be involved in bonding
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.180]   between people and other creatures,
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:22.280]   as well as the breaking of those bonds.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.940]   MDMA is known to powerfully increase oxytocin release.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.220]   In fact, there's a really nice study on this done in humans.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.620]   This is a study I'll provide a link to
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:32.860]   in the show note captions entitled
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.220]   Plasma Oxytocin Concentrations Following MDMA
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.160]   or Intranasal Oxytocin in Humans.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.900]   Nowadays, oxytocin is available by nasal inhaler.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.940]   To be honest, I don't know the legality around it.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.120]   I don't know if it's gray market or,
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.540]   but what I'm about to tell you will basically discourage you
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.500]   from wanting to take it,
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.580]   because what they found in this study was
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:59.900]   people given either 0.75 or 1.5 milligrams per kilogram
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.460]   of body weight of MDMA experienced increases in oxytocin.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.160]   However, it was only the group that took 1.5 milligrams
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.340]   per kilogram of body weight of MDMA
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.140]   that experienced the really big significant changes
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.060]   in oxytocin.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.360]   And when I say really big,
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.960]   really highly statistically significant,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.860]   what they observed is that in the placebo group,
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.260]   because of course they include a placebo group,
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:27.540]   the amount of circulating oxytocin
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:31.020]   was 18.6 picograms per milliliter,
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.940]   which to you probably means nothing.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.620]   And to me also sort of means nothing
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:38.000]   because those units of oxytocin can't be directly related
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.840]   to any kind of direct experience of feeling bonded
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:41.680]   or not bonded.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.180]   That's just a number, but nonetheless,
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.540]   it provides a baseline to compare to the average levels
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.740]   of oxytocin in the bloodstream of people
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.780]   that were given 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of MDMA,
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:57.020]   which is 83.7 picograms per milliliter.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.400]   That equates to nearly a five-fold increase
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.340]   in the amount of circulating oxytocin
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.220]   when people are under the influence of MDMA.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:07.340]   Now, this study had a bunch of different conditions,
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.200]   not just MDMA of different doses, not just placebo.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.300]   They also had people take oxytocin by nasal spray,
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.900]   which we know can change levels of circulating oxytocin.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.500]   And indeed when measured in the study,
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:24.660]   it did change levels of circulating oxytocin.
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.660]   And the end point in the study was to have people
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.940]   give subjective ratings of their feelings
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:33.860]   of connectedness to one another, as well as rate.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.460]   And here I'm just drawing directly from the paper
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:39.260]   of how much they like the feeling, how much they felt high.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.300]   They measure their heart rate, their systolic pressure,
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.660]   their diastolic blood pressure, et cetera.
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:47.020]   And they looked at how social people felt.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.540]   They looked at how insightful people felt.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.020]   And the key takeaway from this study
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.440]   for sake of our discussion here today
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:58.900]   is that it does not, again, it does not appear
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.700]   that the increases in oxytocin produced by taking MDMA
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.800]   are the source of the prosocial effects of MDMA.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:12.020]   And that's also what was found in the animal studies of MDMA
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.680]   where in those studies, mice were given MDMA
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.360]   at comparable doses.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.820]   The doses were a little bit higher
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.660]   than used in the human studies.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:24.620]   But at comparable doses, big increases in oxytocin
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:28.300]   were observed, increases in sociability
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.460]   of those mice were observed,
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.060]   just as they are in humans that take MDMA.
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:35.260]   But in those mice, they were also given a drug
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.420]   to block the oxytocin receptor.
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.640]   And lo and behold, no changes in sociability were observed.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.660]   In humans that take oxytocin by nasal spray,
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.020]   you can see big increases in oxytocin.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.960]   That's not surprising, gets across the blood brain barrier.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   Oxytocin goes up and levels of sociability do not increase.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.400]   So what this points to is a situation
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.240]   where MDMA is increasing dopamine to increase motivation
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.920]   and to reward something, what gets rewarded?
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:07.340]   Well, what gets rewarded is the serotonin activation
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.640]   of particular brain networks associated with sociability.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.760]   And the dramatic increases in oxytocin
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.980]   that are very, very real when people take MDMA
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.920]   do not appear to underlie any of the known short
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.900]   or long-term subjective effects of MDMA.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.500]   Now, a conclusion like that needs to have a caveat.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.260]   And the caveat is that as far as we know,
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.740]   the big increases in oxytocin that are produced by MDMA
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.260]   aren't doing anything for the sorts of effects
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.440]   that we've been talking about here,
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.120]   sociability, empathy, et cetera,
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.980]   but there could be other effects of oxytocin
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.600]   that we're just not aware of.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.120]   That said, the data from both animal models and in humans
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.860]   really point to the fact that the increases in oxytocin
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.060]   that are produced by MDMA are not directly related
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.680]   to any of the short and long-term effects of MDMA
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.020]   that we are most familiar with,
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:02.440]   namely motivation, sociability, increased empathy,
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.760]   or the longstanding changes in neural circuitry
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.640]   that underlie, for instance, reduced threat detection
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.160]   or reduced connectivity between threat detection centers
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.240]   of the brain and interoception.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.920]   So is the big increase in oxytocin produced by MDMA
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.580]   completely irrelevant in the context of this discussion?
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:21.500]   We don't know.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.860]   It appears that it's not very relevant.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.800]   Is oxytocin a meaningless molecule, right?
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.000]   After all, they gave these people
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.240]   nasal infusions of oxytocin.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.060]   Oxytocin went way up.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:36.440]   It didn't observe anything very interesting or significant
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.240]   in the context of sociability,
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.880]   but we do know that oxytocin can play a powerful role
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.320]   in pair bonding and in human-human-human-animal bonding
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.900]   of various kinds from other experiments that have been done.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.560]   So I don't want to diminish the incredible power
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.960]   that oxytocin has in our brains and bodies,
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.640]   but it doesn't appear that the MDMA-induced increases
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.480]   in oxytocin, which are enormous,
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.120]   have much to do with anything related to the value of MDMA
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.480]   as a treatment for PTSD or for its subjective effects
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.360]   on empathy, sociability,
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.560]   or any of those other factors either.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.520]   Now, perhaps the one caveat to that
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.400]   is that Harriet DeWitt's laboratory,
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.840]   which I referred to earlier,
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.840]   has looked at how variations in oxytocin receptor genes
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.940]   vary between people.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.860]   So it turns out that some people have an allele,
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.280]   basically a version of the oxytocin receptor
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.480]   that is different from other people
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.920]   that makes oxytocin work differently
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.280]   and actually less effectively
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.920]   in activating certain brain networks.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.800]   And it does appear that when those people take MDMA,
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.700]   they actually experience less of a prosocial effect
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.000]   of the drug.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.400]   Now, that spits in the face of everything I just said
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.320]   about oxytocin not being involved in the effects of MDMA
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.160]   on prosociability and empathy.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.800]   I think the bulk of the data really point to the fact
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.160]   that it's the serotonin increases
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.320]   combined with the dopamine increases caused by MDMA
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.160]   that lead to most of the understood effects.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.280]   And that oxytocin, if it's playing a role,
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:10.280]   is going to play a more minor role.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.680]   Let's talk about the safety
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.340]   and potential neurotoxicity of MDMA.
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.280]   And here, I really want to highlight
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.800]   that our discussion today is couched
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.740]   in a discussion about the application of pure MDMA
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:27.320]   to animals or humans in the context of laboratory
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.140]   or clinical studies.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.520]   This is really important to point out
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.560]   because I would be remiss if I didn't note
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.760]   that there is a lot of recreational use of MDMA.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.360]   In fact, it was the recreational use of MDMA in the 1980s,
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.760]   but really that took off,
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.380]   even exploded in the 1990s with so-called rave culture
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:53.380]   that created the massive attention on illegality of MDMA
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.040]   and put the drug enforcement agencies onto MDMA
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.500]   as a drug that they wanted to and indeed do restrict.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.760]   In fact, just today, in anticipation of this episode,
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.280]   I put MDMA into the search function on Google
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.200]   and clicked news, and there were at least two reports
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.880]   of major MDMA seizures and busts.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.320]   So again, I want to highlight the fact
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.640]   that MDMA is still illegal to possess or sell
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.480]   and certainly to traffic.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.400]   I also want to highlight the fact that nowadays,
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.080]   all recreational drugs, but certainly MDMA included,
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.320]   are often, in fact, very often contaminated with fentanyl
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.000]   and while fentanyl has certain clinical uses,
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.040]   fentanyl is highly deadly.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.200]   The current estimates are as much as 60%,
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.680]   maybe even 80% of drugs that are sold on the gray market
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.900]   are being repackaged or reformulated with fentanyl,
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.200]   and there have been a lot of fentanyl-related deaths,
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.900]   both in kids and adults.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.640]   So the sourcing of MDMA is extremely important
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.980]   and the safety issues simply cannot be overlooked.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.500]   And I say that not to protect me,
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.820]   I say that to protect you, right?
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.340]   The last thing any of us want is for someone
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.640]   to take a compound thinking it's one compound
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.240]   and it contains another compound
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.160]   and them getting hurt or even dying,
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.080]   and that is happening a lot, a lot,
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.240]   and it is certainly happening a lot for people
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.040]   that think that they're buying MDMA.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:21.080]   The use of MDMA in the laboratory or in the clinical setting
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.000]   with pure MDMA has also been explored
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.380]   for the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:30.240]   So how would methamphetamine and MDMA be neurotoxic?
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.400]   Well, that's because they increase dopamine
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.320]   in the case of methamphetamine
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.780]   and dopamine and serotonin in the case of MDMA,
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.000]   and they do so to a very high degree.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.880]   The big increases in dopamine and serotonin,
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.060]   but in particular, the big increases in dopamine
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.080]   tend to promote electrical activity of other neurons.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.480]   Remember, these are after all neuromodulators,
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.880]   they modulate up or down the activity of other neurons
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.360]   and dopamine tends to modulate
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.920]   the activity of other neurons up.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.160]   So dopamine itself is not neurotoxic,
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.140]   but when a lot of dopamine is released, it is neurotoxic.
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.780]   And it's well known that even a single dose of methamphetamine
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:09.000]   can be neurotoxic, not just for dopamine neurons,
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.580]   but for other types of neurons as well,
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.880]   including serotonergic neurons.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.200]   Put differently, we know that the brains of people
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.660]   that take methamphetamine degenerate to a small
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.900]   or to a large degree, depending on how often
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.680]   they take the drug, how potent the drug is,
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.540]   and whether or not they combine it with other drugs.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:28.380]   And yes, if you heard that combining caffeine
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.500]   with amphetamines can increase the neurotoxicity
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.660]   of amphetamines, such as methamphetamine, that is true.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.420]   If you've heard that taking caffeine within the hours
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:40.940]   or same day as MDMA can increase the toxicity of MDMA,
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:44.460]   that does appear to be true based on animal studies.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.740]   Now, there are not a lot of studies looking
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:50.640]   at the toxicity of MDMA in humans, but there are a few.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.080]   There are also studies looking at the toxicity of MDMA
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.580]   in animal models, including non-human primate models.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:59.700]   Now, this is a very complex literature, a lot of results,
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.380]   not all over the place, but they're scattered
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.220]   in a number of ways.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.940]   First of all, some of the animal studies have used dosages
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.880]   of MDMA as high as two milligrams per kilogram
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.820]   of body weight, as high as three milligrams per kilogram
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:15.540]   of body weight, and even an upwards of that.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.420]   But even for the animal studies that used a range
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.780]   of dosages from 0.75 to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.380]   of body weight, there is some evidence
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.560]   that in laboratory mice or rats, there can be some loss
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.720]   of serotonergic tone in the brains of animals
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.480]   that have been administered MDMA.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.560]   Now, notice I said serotonergic tone,
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.580]   I didn't say serotonin neurons.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:44.080]   Because of the way that MDMA works in encouraging
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.180]   or promoting big releases in dopamine,
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.740]   big releases in serotonin, it's not surprising
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.580]   that if the animals that were given MDMA
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.220]   are subsequently sacrificed, say later that day
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.380]   or the next day, maybe even a week or two weeks later,
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.580]   and those brains are stained for proteins
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.740]   that are related to the synthesis or release of serotonin,
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.980]   it's not surprising that there would be reductions
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:06.140]   in those sorts of proteins, right?
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:09.220]   After all, a lot of dopamine and serotonin is released
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.380]   and it can be depleted.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:14.600]   But I should point out, depletion of a neuromodulator
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.500]   in the short term is not the same thing
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.220]   as depletion of that neuromodulator in the long-term,
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:21.780]   nor is it the same as loss of the neurons
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:24.620]   that release dopamine and serotonin itself.
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.500]   So there are data pointing to the fact
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:30.140]   that repeated administration of MDMA
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.500]   at dosages that are very much within lines
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.780]   with what we're talking about today,
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:36.460]   1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight,
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.140]   can lower total amounts of serotonin
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:42.060]   or other proteins in the serotonin synthesis pathway
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.360]   or dopamine or proteins that are
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.900]   in the dopamine synthesis pathway in specific areas
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:50.300]   of the brain related to reinforcement, related to mood,
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.500]   related to motivation, et cetera.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.120]   However, the primate studies,
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.980]   or I should say the non-human primate studies,
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.660]   which are the sorts of animal studies
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.580]   that most closely mimic what one expects to see
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.620]   in the human brain, because after all,
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.860]   mice and the effects of these drugs in mice
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:07.780]   do translate to humans, but it's thought
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.460]   that non-human primates provide a model
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.620]   that's far more similar to humans.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.460]   There, the data start to get kind of complicated
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:21.060]   in a way that suggests that MDMA might not be as neurotoxic
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.460]   as is thought based on the rodent studies.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:27.180]   And this gets into a whole history of back and forth
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.260]   between different laboratories and governing bodies
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:32.080]   who are trying to keep MDMA illegal,
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.940]   as well as people such as the Sasha Shulgans of the world
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.240]   and people in the therapy community that are excited
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.500]   about the potential for MDMA becoming legal
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.220]   for the treatment of PTSD.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:46.020]   And it really centers around one or two studies,
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:48.720]   both of which were published in very high profile journals.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.620]   And the one that I'll highlight,
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.740]   because the results are now very clear and conclusive,
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.780]   is a study that was published back in 2002,
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.820]   which was entitled
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:02.660]   Severe Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity in Primates
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:07.660]   After a Common Recreational Dose Regimen of MDMA or Ecstasy.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:10.260]   This paper was published in the journal Science,
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.300]   which is one of the three apex journals
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.180]   for publishing scientific research.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:17.240]   So there's Science, Nature, and Cell.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.460]   Those are the top, top journals,
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.460]   the most stringent journals
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.820]   to get scientific manuscripts into.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:25.020]   The paper received a lot of attention
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.020]   because as you can imagine, based on the title,
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.400]   it suggested that even recreational doses of ecstasy,
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.700]   even if it's pure ecstasy
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.260]   and it doesn't have contamination
[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:35.660]   from additional methamphetamine or other things in it,
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:39.700]   is neurotoxic to serotonergic and/or dopaminergic neurons.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.060]   This is largely where MDMA got the reputation
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.760]   for "putting holes in your brain."
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.260]   However, this study came under a lot of scrutiny
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.280]   for a couple of reasons.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.340]   First of all, and I'm certainly not saying this,
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:56.220]   but it was argued that the authors of the study
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:59.700]   were perhaps trying to prevent the legalization of MDMA
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.220]   for the treatment of PTSD.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:04.320]   As far as I know, there's no direct evidence
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:05.380]   that that statement is true,
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:06.900]   but you will actually find that
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.180]   in some of the scientific journals.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.800]   In fact, I was able to find an editorial
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.120]   that was published in the Biomedical Journal in 2003,
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:19.120]   which argued somehow that Dr. Ricarte was accused
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.540]   of "rushing his results into print
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.340]   because of legislation designed to curb ecstasy use
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:26.400]   before U.S. Congress."
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.260]   So, you know, there were some connotations,
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.340]   or rather there were some strong suggestions
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:32.660]   that there was a political backing
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.420]   to trying to get this study done quickly
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.400]   and into print and so forth.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.180]   I don't think that ever really got resolved.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.380]   What did get resolved, however,
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:45.340]   is that the very study in question was retracted, okay?
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:49.440]   So the authors themselves published a letter of retraction
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.140]   that unfortunately is not as well recognized
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:55.300]   as the paper that stimulated this idea
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.820]   that MDMA is neurotoxic in primates.
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:00.000]   And keep in mind that we are human primates,
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.740]   non-human primates being the closest model
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.540]   to human primates that we are aware of.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.500]   But to make a long story short,
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:09.660]   there were some issues of labeling of MDMA
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:11.640]   versus other drugs in the laboratory.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.380]   There were some issues of mislabeling,
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.260]   all of which were eventually acknowledged
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.940]   by the authors of the study.
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.540]   And they concluded, in fact,
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:22.200]   they verified based on some very detailed analysis
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.500]   that what these monkeys were injected with
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.780]   was not actually MDMA,
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:31.220]   but rather was methamphetamine itself.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.740]   So what's not often acknowledged
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.060]   is the retraction of the paper on neurotoxicity.
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:39.000]   And unfortunately, the neurotoxicity issue
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.220]   is often what's mentioned.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.380]   Now, keep in mind,
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:44.820]   there are studies in rodents showing neurotoxicity of MDMA,
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:47.140]   perhaps even at recreational doses.
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.600]   But to date, at least to my knowledge,
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.180]   there don't seem to be any data
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.300]   in either non-human primates or in humans
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.060]   showing toxicity of MDMA at clinically relevant doses,
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.820]   provided it is pure MDMA.
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.820]   I want to be very clear.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:04.860]   I'm not saying that if you can get pure MDMA
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.460]   that you should take it or that it won't be neurotoxic.
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.020]   Certainly, we can expect
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.760]   that because of the huge known variation
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.860]   in dopamine receptors, in serotonin receptors,
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:17.440]   and of course, because of the known interactions
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.300]   between MDMA and other compounds, in particular caffeine,
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:26.140]   but also drugs such as cocaine or other stimulants,
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:28.740]   that some people might experience more toxicity
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:32.060]   to a given dose of MDMA compared to somebody else.
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:32.900]   And there's really no way
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:36.120]   to detect that susceptibility to neurotoxicity.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.280]   Now, what we do know is that there are people
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.020]   in the general population that have taken a lot of MDMA,
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.360]   anywhere from one to 200
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.340]   or sometimes even in excess of 400 doses of MDMA.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:48.640]   And there now are studies
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.460]   that have explored the neurotoxicity
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.560]   and perhaps even more importantly,
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.400]   the neurocognitive and behavioral effects
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.400]   of taking MDMA either zero times, one time, five times,
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.980]   40 times, 200 times, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.220]   And one of the,
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:10.240]   what I would consider landmark studies in this area
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.900]   is a study entitled residual neurocognitive features
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.500]   of long-term ecstasy users
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.220]   with minimal exposure to other drugs.
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.120]   And those words with minimal exposure to other drugs
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.300]   is really key in the context of this conversation.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:27.320]   Because as I mentioned before, interactions between drugs,
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.000]   what's called polypharmacology, can create neurotoxicity.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.420]   It's unclear if MDMA is neurotoxic,
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:37.280]   but we know methamphetamine on its own is neurotoxic.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.060]   We also know that people often will combine MDMA
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.100]   and methamphetamine.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.240]   We also know that a lot of so-called MDMA out there
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.760]   is mostly methamphetamine with only a little bit of MDMA.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.900]   So a study of the sort that I'm about to describe
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.200]   where it is essentially confirmed
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.080]   that people were taking pure MDMA
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.720]   and not taking any other drugs is of immense value.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.540]   This study has been a little bit controversial.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.320]   In fact, I've talked about it before.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.940]   I talked about it on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:09.640]   I've talked about it briefly with a guest on this podcast,
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.460]   Dr. Nolan Williams, who's a triple board certified physician,
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:13.680]   psychiatrist and neurologist
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.520]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.840]   And it's an interesting study and a little bit controversial
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.800]   because it relied on a population of people
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   who have taken MDMA anywhere from one to 200 times
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:31.200]   and who've not taken any other drugs, including caffeine.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.420]   And the population in mind here
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:38.040]   is a population of people living in Utah
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.480]   who self-identify as members
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.120]   of the Church of Latter-day Saints,
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.520]   sometimes referred to as Mormons,
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.960]   sometimes referred to as LDS
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.040]   or of the Church of Latter-day Saints.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.140]   The Church of Latter-day Saints, as I understand,
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.980]   does not allow for taking of certain compounds,
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:57.920]   certain drugs, certainly most recreational drugs,
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.100]   alcohol, even caffeine.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.540]   And I'm sure there's some variation on some of those themes,
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.440]   depending on where people live
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.460]   and the certain communities that they happen to be in.
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:09.100]   I am in no way, shape or form declaring
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:12.780]   that I'm an expert on Latter-day Saints.
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.260]   I have a couple of friends who are LDS.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.300]   I happen to be very nice people.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:19.100]   As far as I know, they were not the people in this study,
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.700]   but this study really emphasized ecstasy users,
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.260]   as they're called, who have not taken other drugs,
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.240]   who self-identify as LDS.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:32.780]   And the major takeaway of this study was that for moderate,
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:35.740]   meaning people who have taken ecstasy
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:40.680]   anywhere from 22 to 50 times in their lifetime,
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.580]   as well as heavy users of MDMA,
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.240]   so these are people who have taken MDMA
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:49.240]   anywhere from 60 to 450 times in their lifetime,
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.460]   there was little evidence of decreased cognitive performance
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:57.460]   in standard assays for cognitive performance.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:01.040]   Now, there were some effects showing poor,
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.980]   here I'm quoting from the findings,
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.700]   poor strategic self-regulation,
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.340]   quote, "Possibly reflecting increased impulsivity."
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.380]   However, when you see a conclusion like that,
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:13.940]   you should immediately be thinking chicken versus egg,
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:16.540]   right, it could be that people that are more impulsive
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:20.900]   and that have less strategic self-regulation
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:24.140]   are more likely to take ecstasy 450 times,
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:25.060]   you could conclude that,
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:28.260]   or you could conclude that people who have taken ecstasy
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:31.940]   75 times or 25 times, et cetera,
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:35.620]   are degrading their levels of self-control
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.160]   and thereby increasing impulsivity.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.040]   The direction of the effect is not known,
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.380]   these are purely correlations.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.900]   Nonetheless, this study and a few others like it
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.380]   really stand as our best evidence,
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:51.380]   believe it or not, as to how ecstasy taken many times,
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:53.620]   because after all these people are taken anywhere
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.460]   from 22 to 450 doses of ecstasy in their lifetime,
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.660]   is producing severe detriments in cognitive performance
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.940]   and that simply does not appear to be the case.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.980]   Now, unfortunately, there are no data
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:08.020]   looking at the brains of these individuals,
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.120]   looking at, for instance,
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.100]   which brain structures are active or less active,
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:14.460]   or perhaps even looking at levels of serotonin or dopamine,
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.460]   all things that can be done with
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.180]   positron emission tomography imaging,
[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.500]   functional MRI, et cetera.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.640]   Hopefully those studies will be done
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.220]   in the not too distant future.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:25.820]   But if we were to just take a step back from all the data,
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:28.240]   the data in mice, in rats, in non-human primates,
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.100]   the retraction of the study in non-human primates,
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:33.460]   which showed that the primates
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:36.340]   that showed neurodegeneration were not given MDMA
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.740]   as it was thought by the researchers,
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:39.420]   but rather as later was acknowledged,
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:41.460]   were actually given methamphetamine.
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:44.860]   And we take into account these moderate and heavy users
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:46.660]   of MDMA who, as far as we know,
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.580]   are being honest and haven't taken any other drugs.
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:52.140]   And we look at the clinical studies
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.500]   where people who have never taken MDMA
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:58.700]   are given one or two or three defined doses of pure MDMA.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:00.580]   We'll talk about those studies in a moment.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:04.140]   I think the gestalt, the top contour,
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.900]   the overall view of those studies is that
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.540]   provided it is pure MDMA
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:14.500]   and provided the individual is not consuming other drugs
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.180]   which have the potential to be neurotoxic
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.860]   and provided that it's being done
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.740]   in a controlled clinical setting,
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.140]   the risk for toxicity seems quite a bit lower
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.860]   than the popular press has promoted.
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:31.540]   And yet there is still the risk of neurotoxicity
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.820]   if people are taking high doses of MDMA
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.500]   or taking it very frequently,
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.660]   or certainly if they are taking it
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.060]   in conjunction with other drugs
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:45.060]   or, or I should say, and/or taking MDMA in settings
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:47.020]   that can promote neurotoxicity.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.380]   And the settings I'm referring to are any settings
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:52.420]   in which blood pressure or body temperature
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:55.300]   have the propensity to be greatly increased.
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.980]   Every study in mice and non-human primates and in humans
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:00.540]   in which MDMA is administered
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:02.860]   has observed significant increases
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.140]   in blood pressure and heart rate.
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:07.340]   MDMA is after all a psychostimulant.
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:09.100]   It's a sympathomimetic.
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:10.820]   Talk about sympathomimetics and what that means
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:13.940]   in the episode on Adderall and Vyvanse and ADHD.
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.980]   But basically it's ramping up the activity
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.280]   of the sympathetic nervous system,
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.820]   which is your fight or flight system, okay?
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:22.260]   This is why people who take these drugs get big pupils,
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.820]   you know, big pupils of the eyes.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.540]   This is why they feel agitated, they want to talk a lot.
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:27.220]   They feel like they want to move a lot.
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:29.620]   This is why people take it to dance at raves, et cetera.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:31.620]   But when people take sympathomimetics,
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:34.700]   whether or not it's MDMA or amphetamine or cocaine
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:35.980]   or even caffeine,
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:38.220]   there's an increase in blood pressure and heart rate,
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.180]   but also body temperature.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.980]   And if that's done in an environment
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.520]   in which there's very little temperature regulation,
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.260]   so people aren't, for instance,
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.660]   drinking enough fluids and electrolytes,
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.540]   it's very hot in the room,
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.460]   you can get neurotoxicity based on temperature effects.
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.720]   And that's because serotonin and dopamine
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.980]   also act on the so-called medial pre-optic area
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:58.820]   of the hypothalamus,
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.620]   which is involved in temperature regulation.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:02.260]   If you're curious about temperature regulation,
[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.060]   I covered a lot of that in the episodes
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.100]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast on deliberate cold exposure
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.700]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.320]   This is an area I used to work on many years ago
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.320]   as a research scientist before moving on to other topics
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.780]   to research in my laboratory.
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:19.540]   Big increases in body temperature are not good.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.420]   The body, and in particular your brain,
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:24.180]   can tolerate decreases in body temperature
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:29.180]   that are pretty robust and you can still stay safe.
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.360]   You're not going to kill neurons,
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.500]   but even an increase of three or four degrees
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.340]   in body temperature can start to kill off neurons.
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.260]   So when thinking about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA,
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.820]   the conditions, that is the environmental conditions,
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.340]   the behavioral conditions under which somebody takes MDMA
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:49.620]   are vitally important, at least important, I would argue,
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:52.620]   as any other compounds they might be ingesting with MDMA.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.200]   So that's something really serious to consider.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.020]   So if somebody says MDMA puts holes in your brain,
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.940]   you would be correct in being skeptical
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:03.260]   or at least giving them some counterarguments
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:04.400]   for that statement.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.080]   But if somebody says MDMA is not toxic,
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.200]   well then you would be equally valid in saying,
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.180]   ah, wait, but we need to think about the conditions
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.040]   under which MDMA is being taken.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.320]   Is it pure MDMA or is it mostly methamphetamine?
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.640]   In which case it would be very toxic.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:22.040]   Is it MDMA alone or in conjunction with caffeine
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.600]   within that same 24 hour period?
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.700]   Is it MDMA while moving around a lot or being outdoors
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:28.920]   or being in an environment,
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.600]   perhaps a rave or dance type environment
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.520]   where temperature is going up?
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.220]   Well, in that case, it could be very neurotoxic.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:37.100]   So pharmacology of MDMA counts,
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.920]   but so does polypharmacology,
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.020]   the ingestion of other compounds,
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.200]   not just during the MDMA session,
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:47.060]   but also in the 24 hours before and after that MDMA session.
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:51.080]   And behaviors will certainly impact temperature,
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.940]   which will impact whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic or not.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:55.900]   And despite my efforts,
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:59.360]   I couldn't find out whether or not the LDS community
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.480]   has officially sanctioned the use of MDMA.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.760]   Certainly that's one possibility,
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.180]   but I have no evidence for that.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.840]   Or rather whether or not certain people
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.920]   within the LDS community have allowed themselves,
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.680]   given themselves permission to use MDMA
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.500]   and they are not using other drugs.
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.720]   What I do understand to be the case
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.760]   is that people within the LDS community
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.060]   are discouraged from using drugs
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.620]   like caffeine or cocaine or alcohol.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.840]   And this particular population of people
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:31.680]   that was explored in this study self-identify as LDS
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.320]   and self-identify as having taken MDMA
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:37.280]   anywhere from 22 to 450 times.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.960]   But where they got permission for that,
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.260]   whether or not it was from someone else or from themselves,
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:42.100]   I do not know.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.760]   What I do know is that
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.920]   within the acknowledgements of the paper,
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.220]   there's actually a thank you to the person
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:53.600]   that identified this "unique population" for our study.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.220]   So I welcome you to take a look at the paper.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:59.400]   And if any of you know more about
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.020]   if and how a particular subgroup within the LDS community
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.720]   is allowed to take MDMA,
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.680]   perhaps you want to put those
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.520]   in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.220]   Before moving to our discussion about what MDMA is doing
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.600]   and the effects that people are seeing
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.400]   in the clinical studies for the treatment of PTSD,
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.160]   which by the way, are extremely exciting.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.160]   I can't wait to share these data with you.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.360]   I do want to touch on something that
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.360]   anyone who's heard about MDMA
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:27.600]   or perhaps used MDMA is familiar with.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:30.120]   And that's the so-called crash that people experience
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.780]   after MDMA.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.200]   There are a lot of myths about the post MDMA crash.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.080]   And there's a lot of lore out there on the internet
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.520]   about how to offset the crash
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.320]   and a lot of lore about how to prevent
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.820]   the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.880]   Earlier, we talked about some of the major points
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.200]   around offsetting neurotoxicity.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.660]   So certainly making sure that any MDMA that one takes
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.360]   is in the legal clinical setting,
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.840]   that it's therefore pure MDMA, right?
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.240]   That it's not cut with other things,
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.200]   which certainly can increase toxicity,
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.060]   controlling the temperature of one's environment,
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:06.600]   restricting caffeine intake,
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:11.600]   at least on the day of MDMA ingestion,
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.160]   but certainly the day before and the day after
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.400]   would be advantageous as well,
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.680]   simply because of the way that caffeine
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.780]   and activation of the adenosine receptor,
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.000]   as well as caffeine's effects on dopamine receptors
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.040]   can interact with the potential,
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.660]   again, potential neurotoxicity of MDMA.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:29.780]   But the crash that one experiences after MDMA
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.220]   is actually a phenomenon very common
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.800]   to the crash that one experiences
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.280]   after ingestion of any type of stimulant,
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.660]   cocaine, amphetamine, et cetera.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:42.160]   And the crash that we're referring to is a drop in mood,
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.100]   increase in lethargy, feelings of lack of motivation.
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.760]   Many people have wrongly assumed
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:51.260]   that the crash was due to quote unquote,
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:54.140]   depletion of serotonin or depletion of dopamine,
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:57.240]   or maybe even death of serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.320]   And while certainly that could be the case,
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.440]   it's very unlikely that that would be the case
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.100]   in the immediate 24 or 48 hours after MDMA ingestion.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:10.000]   That said, you will see protocols
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.700]   that people have put out on the internet such as,
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.600]   oh, you know, after taking MDMA,
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.120]   you should take a bunch of, you know,
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.800]   5-HTP or other precursors to serotonin or dopamine,
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.580]   which come in amino acid form.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.480]   So L-tryptophan, for instance, is the amino acid precursor
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.860]   to serotonin, it's in the serotonin synthesis pathway.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:32.040]   You'll hear that people will take L-tyrosine,
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.160]   which is the amino acid precursor to dopamine
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.260]   as a way to try and buffer or increase dopamine
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.700]   during the so-called period of the crash.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.260]   There's really no evidence
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.960]   that any of those things can be beneficial.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.700]   And there is actually some reason to believe
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.200]   that it might be detrimental
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.080]   because if anything, taking L-tryptophan
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.360]   and taking L-tyrosine
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.000]   would actually further deplete serotonin and dopamine.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.480]   So the logic there is simply not very good.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:03.800]   What is clear, however, is that MDMA can cause
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.180]   not just profound increases
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:07.800]   in dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin,
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.320]   but that anytime there's a big increase in dopamine,
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.600]   there is going to be a post dopaminergic increase
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.440]   in prolactin release.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.640]   And prolactin is a hormone,
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.160]   sometimes considered a neurohormone,
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.360]   but it's really a hormone that's involved in a lot of things,
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.880]   milk let down in lactating women.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:27.240]   It's involved in setting the refractory period
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:32.160]   to sexual arousal and erection and ejaculation in males
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.000]   after ejaculation.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.780]   It's involved in lots of different functions
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:37.720]   in the brain and body,
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:40.160]   including the laying down of body fat stores.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:43.500]   And it's also associated with increases in lethargy,
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.480]   decreases in dopamine.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:48.800]   This is why drugs that increase dopamine
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.120]   are known to decrease prolactin,
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.960]   at least in the short term.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:56.740]   This is why drugs like cabergoline, for instance,
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.680]   that increase dopamine are used
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.820]   as ways to suppress prolactin.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.440]   Now, MDMA ingestion is known
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.480]   to dramatically increase prolactin,
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:07.760]   and people are starting to realize
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.080]   that it perhaps is the increase in prolactin
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.080]   that occurs both during and for some period of time,
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.040]   probably hours or days after ingestion of MDMA
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.120]   that leads to at least some components
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.200]   of the so-called crash,
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.640]   that feeling of lethargy and lack of motivation,
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.440]   maybe diminished mood, et cetera.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.740]   And for that reason,
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.860]   some people have started to explore the use of things
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:34.860]   like P5P, which is essentially a metabolite of vitamin B6,
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:38.000]   which is known to suppress prolactin
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.840]   as a way to try and buffer some of that crash.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.000]   To my knowledge, there are no human data yet exploring
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.760]   the use of P5P or other vitamin B6 derivatives
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.960]   or cabergoline or things of that sort
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:54.640]   to reduce prolactin in a controlled,
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:57.000]   standardized clinical trial kind of manner.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.100]   But I've spoken to some of the clinicians
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:01.640]   that are using MDMA legally
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.680]   within the context of the treatment of PTSD.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.480]   And this is an area that's starting
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.360]   to receive some additional attention.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.040]   So I just mention it briefly here because, for instance,
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.260]   there's a lot of ideas out there
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:14.880]   that people should be taking L-tryptophan,
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.320]   they should be taking L-tyrosine,
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.000]   they should be taking magnesium, other things, et cetera,
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.320]   after taking MDMA in order to recover
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.120]   from the post-MDMA crash more quickly.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.520]   But it's really the increase in prolactin,
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.260]   which speaks most directly to the subjective effects
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.560]   of the so-called crash.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.280]   So by my read of the mechanisms of MDMA,
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.760]   the neurochemicals it releases,
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.520]   the neurohormones that it promotes the release of,
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:40.040]   prolactin in particular,
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.000]   this P5P suppression of prolactin
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.600]   is perhaps the one that's most intriguing
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.080]   and that really has any kind of mechanistic basis.
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.800]   So I promise that going forward,
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:51.180]   as the scientists and clinicians that are using MDMA
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:53.540]   for the treatment of PTSD and other conditions,
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:56.200]   such as alcohol use disorder, et cetera,
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.560]   start to explore the use of post-MDMA session P5P
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:03.200]   and other modes of suppressing prolactin
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.340]   for the hours and days after MDMA,
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.320]   promise to update you on those findings.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.440]   Throughout today's episode,
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.720]   I've been referring to clinical studies,
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.840]   that is clinical trials,
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.160]   exploring the use of MDMA
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.760]   in order to augment treatment for PTSD.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.320]   So let's just take a moment and talk about what PTSD is.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.600]   PTSD is post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.900]   Trauma is anything that modifies the brain
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:33.240]   to function less well going forward.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.240]   You can have physical trauma,
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.840]   you can have emotional trauma.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:40.200]   Typically PTSD is used to refer to emotional trauma
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.400]   caused by either single events.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:46.320]   So you can imagine car accident, sexual assault.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.000]   These could be first person experiences.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.800]   So things that happened to somebody
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.960]   that leads to trauma and then PTSD.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.640]   These can also be third person events
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.480]   where someone observes something that is traumatic to them.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.520]   Maybe somebody being killed, dismembered,
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.760]   any number of different things
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.840]   that could be very traumatic in the immediate and longterm.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:10.400]   And of course, PTSD need not be caused
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.440]   only by single event traumas,
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.640]   but by multiple event traumas,
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.760]   entire relationships, entire childhoods,
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.460]   wartime experiences, combinations of different traumas
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:22.520]   and on and on.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.880]   There are so many different forms of trauma.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.920]   If any of you are interested in trauma and its treatment,
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:31.280]   I highly recommend the book "Trauma" by Dr. Paul Conte.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.680]   He's an MD, medical doctor, psychiatrist.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.800]   He was featured as a guest on this podcast.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:38.240]   He's been on a number of other prominent podcasts.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.640]   We will provide a link in our show note captions
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.880]   to the book "Trauma."
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:45.160]   I consider that book to be the best book
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.880]   in terms of describing what trauma is and isn't
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.200]   and how it leads to PTSD.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.640]   It also describes some of Dr. Paul Conte's own experiences
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:55.840]   with trauma and his own treatment of trauma
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.140]   in his patient population,
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.000]   which is quite wide ranging men, women, young people,
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.960]   older people, and a variety of traumatic experiences.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.240]   So excellent book for those of you interested in trauma.
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.920]   Now, the treatment of trauma has been met
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.820]   with some degree of success through quality talk therapy.
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.560]   Let's define quality talk therapy
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.180]   in the way that Dr. Paul Conte did on this episode.
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:20.820]   That's talk therapy for which the patient,
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:22.340]   sometimes referred to as the client,
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:24.820]   but more traditionally referred to as the patient,
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.720]   and the therapist, so a psychologist or psychiatrist,
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:30.000]   has good rapport.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.260]   And as a consequence of that rapport,
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:34.060]   there is the feeling of support,
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:37.860]   that there is a safe place in which to explore the trauma
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:40.000]   and what's happening in one's current life
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.720]   in order to understand how that trauma
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:44.800]   is fitting into adaptive and maladaptive behaviors
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.600]   and emotional states.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.580]   Now, in addition to rapport and support being critical,
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:53.540]   there's a third component of effective talk therapy
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.280]   for trauma, which is insight,
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:58.020]   where one's ability to come to an understanding
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:01.220]   of why one feels the way they do
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:04.000]   and to link that to some larger context,
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.620]   that brings about some degree of relief.
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.820]   And that's where things start to get a little bit abstract.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:13.060]   And that's also where we start to see that
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:16.320]   while trauma therapy in the form of talk therapy
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.020]   can be very effective,
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:22.140]   about half of people that undergo talk therapy
[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:25.120]   and talk therapy alone for the treatment of PTSD
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.420]   achieve no long lasting relief of symptoms,
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:30.740]   and an even smaller number of them
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:35.640]   undergo complete remittance of their PTSD, okay?
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:39.460]   So their symptoms can lessen,
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.320]   they can get some improvement,
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.520]   but that improvement is often slight or is transient.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.460]   And for those that do achieve relief,
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:52.460]   it's often not complete remission of the PTSD itself.
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:55.480]   Now, in addition to talk therapy for PTSD,
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.440]   there is of course prescription drug therapies.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.400]   And most often these fall under the category of SSRIs,
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.820]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:07.680]   And it's well known that SSRIs can be
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:10.680]   in limited circumstances effective for the treatment of PTSD.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:14.220]   It has been shown, for instance, that as many as 40,
[01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.080]   maybe as many as 60% of people that take SSRIs
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:20.300]   for the treatment of PTSD get some symptom relief.
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:23.440]   Now, that is not to say that SSRIs don't have side effects.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.020]   They can have side effects.
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:27.700]   Some of you are probably familiar with these side effects.
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:30.640]   Things like blunting of libido, blunting of appetite,
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.600]   or increases in appetite in some cases,
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:35.880]   disruption of sleep-wake rhythms, motivation, et cetera.
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.320]   So there's often an exploration
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.120]   for the so-called minimal effective dose
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.200]   that provides some symptom relief to PTSD,
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.840]   but that doesn't introduce unwanted side effects.
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.360]   And of course, there's a third situation
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.960]   where people are taking SSRIs
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.400]   and doing talk therapy for PTSD.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:53.560]   And what's very clear is that anytime you add
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:56.360]   quality talk therapy to a drug treatment,
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:59.960]   you're going to improve the outcomes for that drug treatment.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.460]   The reverse is not always true.
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.440]   It's not always the case
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.700]   that adding prescription drug treatment to talk therapy
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:06.300]   improves outcomes for talk therapy,
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.120]   although that has been observed in a number of studies.
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.140]   Now, the whole idea of exploring the use of MDMA
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.280]   for the treatment of PTSD stemmed from the fact
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:18.320]   that even in people who are getting quality talk therapy,
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.480]   and again, we can define quality talk therapy
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:25.480]   as good rapport between patient and clinician,
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.780]   as well as feelings of support,
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.640]   as well as potential insight.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.280]   And even when SSRIs are combined
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.960]   with that quality talk therapy,
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.760]   there's still a large number of people
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.800]   who simply do not achieve significant
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:42.780]   or long-lasting relief from their PTSD,
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:44.600]   and an even fewer number
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.760]   who go into full remittance of their PTSD.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.280]   That is despite being diligent
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:51.080]   and hardworking in their talk therapy,
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.000]   despite the therapist being very committed,
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.140]   despite the use of SSRIs in conjunction
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:56.840]   with that talk therapy,
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.840]   those people often still qualify as having PTSD.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.480]   And the goal of course is for somebody
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.000]   to receive treatment that allows them
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.820]   to no longer meet the criteria for having PTSD,
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:11.160]   not just in terms of a clinical evaluation,
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.820]   but that they themselves report feeling much better,
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:17.520]   not feeling overwhelmed with the symptomology of PTSD.
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:20.120]   Now, the symptomology for PTSD is vast,
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.720]   and it's far too vast to go into
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.140]   into a lot of detail right now.
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.580]   I think most people are familiar
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:27.680]   with the stereotyped example of PTSD.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:31.260]   This is the soldier that comes back from overseas
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:35.080]   that has been in gunfights or in battles of different kinds,
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:38.160]   has likely seen casualties and severe injuries,
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:41.040]   and that upon return to a safe environment
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.640]   is still experiencing a lot of anxiety,
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.320]   and sometimes panic attacks that occur seemingly at random,
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.560]   or that can be sparked by the classic stereotyped example
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.840]   is a car backfires,
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:52.200]   and then the person suddenly feels
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.860]   as if they're back in battle.
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:56.280]   That sort of thing does happen, certainly,
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:00.580]   but there are a whole other category of symptoms of PTSD,
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.080]   which include dissociative symptoms of PTSD,
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.520]   people who have PTSD from very intensely
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:09.940]   traumatic experiences that are checked out.
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:11.520]   They don't feel like they can engage.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:12.840]   They have brain fog.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.980]   They are distracted.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:18.160]   They go from feeling anxious to feeling exhausted.
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.900]   They have sleep issues.
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.000]   Not surprisingly then,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.400]   people with PTSD of either the dissociative type
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.920]   or other symptomology of PTSD,
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.440]   and keep in mind that one can have both dissociative
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.620]   and non-dissociative symptoms of PTSD,
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:33.120]   such as anxiety and panic,
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:37.700]   are at a far greater risk of substance abuse.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:40.240]   So the current estimates are that people with PTSD,
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:43.520]   no matter what type of PTSD, dissociative symptoms,
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.580]   or otherwise, you know, panic attacks or both,
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:50.680]   are at a much greater risk of having addictions
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:54.480]   to either illicit drugs or prescription drugs or both.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:57.000]   So things like alcohol use disorder
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.900]   is very common in people with PTSD.
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:01.160]   Opioid use disorder is very common.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:04.280]   Stimulant use disorder, and on and on.
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:07.320]   So people with PTSD suffer at a number of different levels,
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:10.640]   and there are all these what are called comorbidities
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:15.240]   with PTSD, including addiction, but also depression, anxiety.
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.800]   And so you can start to see how PTSD
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.200]   sets up a whole cascade of things
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:21.880]   that make living life extremely problematic
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.800]   at the level of basic relationships,
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.420]   functioning in the workplace.
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:28.760]   And even when mental health appears to be in check,
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:30.800]   oftentimes people are holding a lot in,
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.480]   so they have cardiovascular and cerebral vascular deficits
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.760]   that cause a lot of problems
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.240]   in their immediate and long-term physical health.
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:40.720]   So PTSD is a very serious issue.
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.560]   The current estimates are that as many as 8% of people
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.460]   in the United States have PTSD.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:49.380]   And again, the estimates around comorbidities
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:54.220]   range anywhere from 17 to 46 or as high as 65% of people
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.860]   with PTSD having comorbidities
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:59.140]   for other mental health issues and addiction in particular.
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:03.120]   So finding lasting relief to PTSD is extremely important
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.280]   and made even more important by the fact
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.700]   that many people with PTSD sadly end up committing suicide.
[01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:12.340]   So suicide rates are far greater in people with PTSD.
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:14.980]   The exact rates of increase in suicidality
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:18.760]   in people with PTSD are a little bit hard to arrive at
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:21.240]   in the statistics because of all the comorbidities,
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:24.340]   but suffice to say that suicide is far more likely
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:25.720]   in people with PTSD,
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.920]   along with all the other issues that PTSD brings about.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.840]   Now, PTSD creates all the problems that it does,
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:35.060]   largely through changes in brain circuitry,
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:38.160]   as well as neural communication between the brain and body.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.400]   Many people have perhaps heard of the book,
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:41.760]   "The Body Keeps the Score,"
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:44.740]   which is a very successful and popular book
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:46.860]   about the idea that trauma can be, quote unquote,
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.500]   "Stored in the body."
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:52.000]   To be clear, traumas can't actually be stored in the body.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.840]   You don't actually store memories in the body.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.940]   What you store are activation of neural circuits
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.940]   that include brain and body,
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:04.340]   and they all seem to center back into the insula,
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:05.820]   that structure that we talked about earlier,
[01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:06.880]   this structure in our brain
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:09.140]   that has a map of our body surface.
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.420]   So contrary to popular belief,
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:14.500]   we don't store memories in the body or trauma in the body
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.100]   in a way that, for instance,
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.460]   working out a knot or a pain in one's lower back
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.980]   will relieve the trauma.
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:22.500]   It sometimes can activate a memory of the trauma,
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:23.820]   but when one is doing that,
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:26.500]   what you're really doing is activating neural circuits
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:29.340]   that reside within the brain, within the insula,
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:32.160]   that correspond to sensations within the body.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.940]   Now, I don't want to diminish the role of the body
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.500]   in the formation and the persistence of PTSD,
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.460]   and I certainly think the book,
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:40.420]   "The Body Keeps the Score" is a pioneering book.
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:43.220]   It's, in fact, an important book,
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:45.820]   but I want to emphasize that the modern neuroscience
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:48.940]   really points to the fact that PTSD
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:52.740]   is caused by the exact sorts of brain network activations
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:54.460]   that we were discussing earlier,
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:56.580]   things like heightened levels of activation
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:58.900]   in the amygdala to insula pathway,
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:02.140]   which, of course, would exacerbate bodily sensations
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:03.740]   related to the trauma,
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:05.860]   or heightened activation of the hippocampus,
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:07.040]   this memory center in the brain,
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.460]   to amygdala to insula circuitry.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:12.320]   Now, therefore, it should come as no surprise
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:16.700]   that if MDMA can reduce the levels of activity
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:19.580]   in the hippocampal to amygdala to insula circuitry,
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:21.380]   and can do so both while someone
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:22.700]   is under the effects of MDMA,
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:26.020]   but then lead to persistent, long-lasting reductions
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:27.980]   in the activation of those brain networks,
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:29.300]   well, then it stands to reason
[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:32.740]   that MDMA could be a valid therapeutic
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.080]   for the treatment of PTSD,
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.840]   and, of course, this has been explored,
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.260]   and here we can really give a nod
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:43.860]   and a large debt of gratitude to the so-called MAPS group.
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:46.340]   The MAPS group is a group that's operating
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.040]   mainly out of Santa Cruz, California,
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.120]   but they have a number of different satellite laboratories
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:54.060]   and clinical groups, both in the US, in Canada, and abroad,
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.020]   where they've worked with government organizations
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:55:00.860]   to get legal authorization to give MDMA
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:04.880]   to patients who have PTSD, to also give them talk therapy,
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:08.560]   and then to compare the effects of talk therapy with MDMA
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:11.180]   to talk therapy with placebo alone,
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:14.780]   and there are about three to five studies in this area now
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:17.240]   that stand as large-scale clinical trials
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.820]   that are showing what can only be described
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:23.100]   as remarkable results for the treatment of PTSD,
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:24.920]   so rather than going to any one of those studies
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.480]   in immense detail, I'm going to summarize
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:27.320]   across those studies.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:30.580]   I will provide links to those in the show note captions.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:33.920]   The two that I think are most interesting
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.000]   are the study entitled "MDMA-Assisted Therapy
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.420]   for Severe PTSD, a Randomized, Double-Blind,
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:42.120]   Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study,"
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:43.700]   as well as the study entitled
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.560]   "The Effects of MDMA-Assisted Therapy
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:48.740]   on Alcohol and Substance Use in a Phase 3 Trial
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:50.660]   for the Treatment of Severe PTSD."
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:52.620]   So as the title suggests, both clinical trials
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:55.340]   involve giving people talk therapy and MDMA,
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:58.060]   or talk therapy and placebo.
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:00.340]   Talk about exactly how that was done in a moment,
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:03.100]   and then to look at relief of PTSD symptoms,
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.460]   but also relief of some of the addictive symptoms
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:08.160]   that are commonly associated with PTSD.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.760]   So just to give you an overview
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:12.900]   of what's happening with these trials
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:14.680]   and why there's so much excitement
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.820]   and why we really are on the cusp of legalization of MDMA
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:20.680]   for the treatment of PTSD
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:23.240]   in the sorts of clinical context I described,
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:28.360]   when people are given just talk therapy alone
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:31.280]   or talk therapy with SSRIs,
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.680]   they will often, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.220]   experience reductions in their severity of PTSD symptoms,
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:39.960]   and rarely they will experience
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.020]   complete remittance of their PTSD.
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:45.160]   That is, they will no longer qualify for PTSD
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.000]   after receiving a number of talk therapy sessions.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.580]   So let's compare that to what happens
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:52.740]   when people do talk therapy in conjunction with MDMA.
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.760]   And I'll explain exactly what that means in a moment,
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:57.420]   but it essentially means taking MDMA
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:59.360]   while doing talk therapy.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:02.180]   However, this is a very important however,
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:04.100]   the people who are taking MDMA in these trials
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.840]   have already done talk therapy without MDMA,
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:11.320]   then they're doing talk therapy under the influence of MDMA,
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:13.780]   and then they are doing sessions of talk therapy
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:15.800]   not under the influence of MDMA,
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:17.200]   and the entire time they're doing that
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:19.240]   with the same two therapists, okay?
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:20.680]   In the placebo group,
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:23.760]   people are doing talk therapy with two therapists,
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:25.560]   but they're not taking MDMA, okay?
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:27.200]   So they're doing the same number of therapy sessions,
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.600]   but they're not taking MDMA.
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.880]   So to just get to the key numbers first,
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:34.180]   the overall rate for clinically effective response
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:37.820]   to MDMA assisted therapy is 88%.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:40.580]   That's what's emerging from these trials,
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:45.280]   versus 60% for the placebo and therapy alone.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:47.140]   So on the face of it, you might say,
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:50.740]   okay, wow, 88% of people who do talk therapy,
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:52.580]   and here I might as well just finally explain
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:53.720]   how this is done.
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:56.780]   Patients are selected because they have PTSD.
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:59.620]   They meet the clinical criteria for PTSD.
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:04.280]   They do three 90 minute therapy sessions with two therapists
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.280]   talking about their PTSD symptoms,
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.380]   talking about to the extent that they can,
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:10.820]   the incident or incidents,
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.900]   the life events that led to that PTSD.
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:17.000]   None of that is done under the influence of any drug, okay?
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.980]   So everyone in the experiment does that.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:22.760]   Then the group divides into two,
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.700]   where half are taking MDMA.
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:29.480]   They take that three times.
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.060]   During those three times,
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:34.480]   they are also receiving therapy sessions
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:36.780]   with the same therapists that they were working with
[01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:38.100]   before they took MDMA.
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:42.220]   The first session, they're taking 80 milligrams of MDMA
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.660]   and then a 40 milligram booster
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:46.160]   about an hour and a half to two hours in.
[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:48.660]   The second session, they are taking a higher dose of MDMA.
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:50.980]   It's 120 milligrams.
[01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:52.920]   And then if they elect to,
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:55.200]   they can take a 60 milligram booster
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:59.240]   about an hour and a half to two hours into the session.
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.320]   And then there's a third session
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:04.640]   where they take, again, 120 milligrams of MDMA
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.000]   and have the option to take a 60 milligram booster
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.080]   about an hour and a half to two hours into the session.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:13.440]   Again, anytime they're on MDMA,
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:16.140]   they have therapists there
[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:18.580]   that they're talking to about their trauma.
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:20.840]   They are either spending time
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:22.760]   with their eyes closed, lying down,
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.080]   sometimes in an eye mask and thinking about the trauma,
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:28.140]   thinking about their current state and experience,
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.160]   also thinking about what happened before.
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:31.960]   Then they're exiting the eye mask
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:34.200]   or talking to the therapist.
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:36.200]   The therapist is taking notes, asking questions.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:39.300]   Remember, they've established a strong rapport,
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:41.440]   supportive relationship with these therapists
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:45.200]   prior to taking MDMA in the therapy session.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:49.360]   And then they also undergo three 90-minute therapy sessions
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:52.280]   with the two therapists spaced one week apart
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:55.400]   after the final MDMA session.
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:58.560]   Now, those that were placed into the placebo condition
[01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:01.100]   do everything exactly the same as I just described.
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:03.040]   So three 90-minute sessions as prep,
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.920]   then three eight-hour sessions with those two therapists,
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:11.100]   and then three 90-minute follow-up sessions one week apart,
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:15.620]   but they take a placebo, not MDMA.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:17.720]   So you can see that in these so-called MAPS studies,
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:20.040]   these clinical trials for PTSD,
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:21.480]   the conditions are very similar
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:25.480]   except for the inclusion of the drug MDMA.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:29.720]   So those rates of success with talk therapy and MDMA,
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:31.840]   again, overall rate for clinically effective response
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.080]   to MDMA-assisted therapy was 88%
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.040]   compared to 60% for therapy and placebo.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.240]   What's even more impressive, however,
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.860]   is that 67% of the people in the MDMA
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:47.880]   plus therapy treatment group
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.660]   no longer met the criteria for PTSD
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.200]   by the end of the treatment.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.100]   So in other words, their PTSD went into remittance.
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:58.360]   Now, we could say they are quote-unquote cured,
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:01.300]   but typically for things like PTSD,
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:03.160]   that's not the language that's used.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:05.640]   Rather, what's used is statistical evaluation
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:09.440]   of how the different symptoms like dissociation or anxiety
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:12.520]   or sleep disorders are explored.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.460]   So while to some of you, a difference between 60% success
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:21.160]   with talk therapy and placebo versus 88% success
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:23.000]   with talk therapy plus MDMA
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.840]   might not seem like that big of a difference.
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:27.160]   It is indeed quite an enormous difference.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.880]   In fact, to my knowledge, there is no other example
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.740]   of a treatment for a psychiatric disorder
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:36.840]   that is successful to the same magnitude.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:37.880]   I could be wrong about that.
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.200]   I'm sure some psychiatrists out there
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.120]   are going to jump on me about this, and please do.
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:45.600]   I would encourage you, if you are aware of any therapy
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.940]   plus drug treatment that is effective
[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:50.420]   at rates of greater than 88%
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:53.620]   for the treatment of a major psychiatric disorder,
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:56.820]   please do put that information in the comments on YouTube,
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.960]   and perhaps a reference to a study would be even better,
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:01.400]   but even if not, just put a reference to that.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:04.280]   That would be great for sake of future episodes, et cetera.
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:08.480]   But nonetheless, an 88% success rate,
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:09.920]   and here I'm referring to success rate
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:12.840]   as a significant reduction in clinical symptoms for PTSD,
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:17.480]   and 67% of those people going into full remittance for PTSD
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:20.760]   by the end of the treatment is pretty spectacular,
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:22.620]   which is why you're hearing so much these days
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:25.360]   about the potential transition of MDMA
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.940]   from a schedule one drug for which there are, quote unquote,
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:31.400]   no clinical applications to potentially a legal
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:36.400]   within the context of clinical use application of MDMA,
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:39.880]   which it does appear the legislature is at least considering
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.720]   for as early as 2024, maybe even later in 2023.
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:46.680]   It remains to be seen.
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:48.720]   Now, a number of other important results have emerged
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:50.600]   from this and other clinical trials.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:53.840]   For instance, remember earlier,
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:56.120]   I talked about how many people with PTSD
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:59.000]   also suffer from alcohol use disorder.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.160]   What's interesting is that for people
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:04.560]   that were in the MDMA plus talk therapy group
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:05.960]   in this and other studies
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.860]   who also had patterns of alcohol use disorder
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:12.080]   and even some other substance use disorders,
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.720]   the MDMA plus talk therapy treatment
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.480]   in many cases resolved their addiction to alcohol
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.480]   or other symptoms as well,
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.520]   and perhaps that shouldn't be surprising
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.980]   if we think about the addictions
[02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:26.940]   as stemming directly from their PTSD,
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:29.480]   but it is surprising if you think about the fact
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:32.480]   that alcohol use disorder and some other addictive disorders
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.360]   oftentimes will stem from disruptions
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.880]   in neural circuitry that are the same disruptions
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:41.560]   in neural circuitry that occur in PTSD,
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:43.460]   but often are the consequence
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:46.440]   of entirely other brain wiring phenomenon.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.600]   What I'm saying here is that just because addiction
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:51.660]   and PTSD are often comorbid with one another,
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:53.680]   it was not necessarily the case
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:57.480]   that treating and resolving PTSD would resolve the alcohol
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:58.840]   or substance abuse disorder,
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:01.240]   and yet that seems to be the case often, not always,
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:03.780]   but often in these successful treatments of PTSD.
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:05.400]   So that's very exciting.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:07.520]   Some of the other particularly exciting results
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.400]   from these clinical trials on MDMA plus talk therapy
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.840]   is that the dissociative form of PTSD
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:18.240]   has traditionally proved to be especially hard to treat,
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.660]   and that's thought to stem from the fact
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:21.680]   that successful treatment of PTSD,
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:23.060]   whether or not it's by talk therapy
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:25.520]   or talk therapy combined with SSRIs
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:28.520]   or talk therapy combined with any drug treatment
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.920]   or behavioral treatment like EMDR,
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.080]   eye movement desensitization reprogramming,
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.940]   or other forms of treatments
[02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:39.320]   that are designed to rewire neural circuitry
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:44.120]   almost always involve the patient getting very close to,
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.160]   or at least reporting the traumatic experiences
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.680]   in a lot of detail.
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:50.080]   And you can imagine why for somebody
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.200]   who's dissociating from that very experience,
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:55.200]   who's "checked out" and can't really seem
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.240]   to access the emotional states and the memories
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.740]   because they're blocked off from them
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:01.920]   or because they're unwilling to access those memories
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:04.120]   and really think about the full emotional capacity
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.560]   of those memories,
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:07.600]   that it would be particularly hard to bring them
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:10.600]   through any kind of treatment for PTSD.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.240]   So it appears that MDMA
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:15.320]   in providing this pro-social empathic,
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:18.400]   again, empathic for others and empathic for self,
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:21.680]   chemical and mental environment,
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:24.480]   as well as the presence of two trusted therapists,
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:27.580]   which one has a really good rapport,
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:31.820]   allows patients with PTSD to really get close
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:33.700]   to those experiences that were traumatic,
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:36.140]   to talk about them and to think about them,
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:39.240]   and in many ways to reframe them in a context
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.940]   that often involves empathy for others
[02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:43.340]   and empathy for self.
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:45.360]   Now here, we're not necessarily talking about
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.720]   forgiveness of perpetrators,
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.500]   although that's sometimes the case,
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:49.820]   that people will forgive the person
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:51.900]   that inflicted the trauma on them,
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:53.480]   but more often than not,
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:56.420]   it's about tying their feelings of trauma
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:57.880]   and their feelings of depression,
[02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.540]   anxiety, dissociation, et cetera,
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:02.200]   to some sort of larger context
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:06.480]   that allows them to see themselves in the role of agency,
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:09.760]   to be in the role of knowing that,
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:11.520]   yes, these things happened,
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:14.800]   and yet by getting close to the emotional load
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:18.060]   of those things and really being, in many ways,
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:20.120]   unafraid to get close to the emotional load of that
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:21.860]   and having support around that,
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:24.220]   that the emotional load seems diminished
[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:26.160]   and that they experience the emotional load
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.940]   of those experiences as diminished
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:29.940]   both within the MDMA treatment session
[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:32.580]   and afterwards for long periods of time.
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:35.060]   So essentially what happens is these people feel
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:38.460]   that once burdened them, they can still remember,
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.780]   but it no longer burdens them.
[02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:41.920]   It no longer feels like it's in their body
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:44.340]   and in their mind or on loop or on repeat
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:46.140]   in a way that's invasive,
[02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:48.580]   in a way that interferes with other aspects
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:50.280]   of normal functioning.
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.680]   So when one hears about these kinds of results,
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:55.120]   and when you hear about some of the patient reports,
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:56.060]   and I invite you to do that,
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:57.820]   you can go to the MAPS site,
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:06:59.500]   which by the way is recruiting subjects
[02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:00.700]   for these clinical trials.
[02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:04.160]   And you'll also find reports of individuals
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:06.540]   who participated in these clinical trials.
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:07.900]   And of course, we will provide links
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:10.060]   to these incredible clinical trials
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:12.320]   that MAPS has spearheaded.
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:16.460]   What you find is that the combination of MDMA
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:19.300]   and talk therapy in many ways
[02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:23.100]   is not about the drug having a particular effect.
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.700]   It's really about the drug having a particular effect
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:29.780]   that allows the motivations and the results of talk therapy
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:31.580]   to really be heightened.
[02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:33.400]   And I think that's a really key point to make
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:34.240]   because up until now,
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:36.780]   we've really been talking about the neurochemistry of MDMA,
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:40.060]   the potential toxicity or lack thereof of MDMA.
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:42.860]   We've been talking about the brain networks, et cetera.
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:46.700]   But when one thinks about the valid clinical use of MDMA
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.620]   for the treatment of PTSD,
[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:52.180]   and I should mention it also had some success
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.700]   in dealing with not only alcohol use disorders
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:56.900]   and other use disorders associated with PTSD,
[02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:00.340]   but also relieving the depression associated with PTSD.
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:03.780]   So now MDMA is being explored for treatment of not just PTSD,
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:05.820]   but also for depression, for alcohol use disorder
[02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:07.460]   and for eating disorders as well.
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:10.800]   MDMA seems to be a compound
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:13.320]   that produces the right kind of subjective
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:15.480]   and neurochemical milieu in the brain
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:18.640]   that allows therapy to be that much more potent
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.580]   within a limited number of sessions.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:23.580]   And when one thinks about the cost of mental health care,
[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:25.180]   how expensive it is to get therapy
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:26.340]   over and over and over again,
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:29.740]   which in ideal circumstances, people are able to do that
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:32.320]   either by way of insurance or by their own finances,
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:35.940]   or I don't want to say that the cost of therapy
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:37.260]   should be reduced because of course,
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:40.560]   therapists have to survive also.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:43.320]   But the idea here is that people who are suffering
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:46.080]   would be able to achieve relief from their PTSD,
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.420]   their depression, their addiction,
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:50.720]   and to be able to do so by hopefully
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:51.940]   persisting in their therapy
[02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:53.860]   over whatever period of time is required,
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:56.080]   but also to assume a circumstance
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:00.100]   in which somebody only has 10 or 15,
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:02.860]   or maybe even just three opportunities
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:04.940]   to undergo treatment for PTSD,
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:08.260]   and nonetheless is able to achieve tremendous relief
[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:10.660]   during the session and after the session.
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:12.460]   And it really does seem to be the case
[02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:15.620]   that for reasons that you now understand,
[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:17.320]   the activation of particular brain networks,
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.300]   the suppression of other brain networks,
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:22.060]   in particular this amygdala to insula pathway,
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.680]   that when people are under the influence of MDMA
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:27.880]   in these very safe and therapeutic supportive settings,
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:30.020]   they're able to look at traumatic events
[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:32.980]   and the ways that those traumatic events impact them
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:34.420]   in ways that really allow them
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:36.340]   to cognitively reframe those events
[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:38.940]   and somatically reframe those events,
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:41.860]   to really change the way that it lives in their body and mind
[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:43.700]   so that it's no longer invasive,
[02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:47.180]   and then they can go on and lead productive, adaptive lives.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:49.620]   And as a final point related to these clinical studies,
[02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:50.900]   I of course would be remiss
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:54.180]   if I didn't touch on some of the so-called adverse effects,
[02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:56.580]   because anytime there's a drug or talk therapy
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:59.180]   for a mental health issue,
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:01.780]   adverse events have to be considered.
[02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:04.040]   And I think it's quite reassuring
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:06.660]   that in the case of MDMA therapy,
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:10.560]   there were no increases in the number of suicide attempts
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:13.080]   or suicidality or obsession with suicide.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:17.220]   Contrast that with the group that received placebo,
[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:20.140]   where there were a certain number of baseline
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:23.740]   and predicted obsessions with suicide.
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:25.160]   Fortunately, at least to my knowledge,
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:27.480]   there was no actual suicide attempt
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:29.540]   or successful suicide, thankfully.
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:32.980]   But the point being that the addition of MDMA drug therapy
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:36.700]   to PTSD talk therapy does not seem to increase
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:38.380]   the quote unquote side effects
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:40.900]   that are sometimes associated with PTSD talk therapy,
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:42.940]   because indeed there can be side effects
[02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:46.700]   to exploring PTSD and trauma as one would expect.
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:48.940]   So overall, I would say it's very exciting times
[02:10:48.940 --> 02:10:52.340]   for the exploration of MDMA as an augment to talk therapy
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:55.220]   for the treatment of PTSD and these other conditions.
[02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:59.020]   Again, I think the MAPS group has done a remarkable job
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:01.480]   of keeping this within the realm of legal
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:04.380]   and trying to move things forward in terms of legislation
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:07.120]   to make sure that MDMA isn't simply made legal
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.740]   and then abused recreationally.
[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:10.220]   I know people out there have different views
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:12.860]   on whether or not drugs like MDMA should be legal
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:15.500]   or not, that's not what this episode is about.
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:18.020]   What I am very excited about, as you can probably tell,
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:20.140]   and what I think a lot of people in the psychology
[02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:22.500]   and psychiatry community are very excited about,
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:24.740]   you say the mental health community at large,
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:28.080]   is that these compounds that for many years
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.700]   were only associated with their recreational uses
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:33.740]   and therefore were not well understood
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:35.440]   because they were often contaminated
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:37.180]   or taken in combination with other things
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:39.660]   or by people that never should have been taking them
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:42.920]   in the first place, taken by young kids,
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:44.900]   which is a whole other matter,
[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:47.560]   lot of issues and problems associated with these compounds.
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:51.140]   And yet we're now seeing from these clinical trials
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:54.260]   when used say properly,
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:58.180]   because really when safety protocols are obeyed,
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:00.060]   when there's clinical support,
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:02.140]   it is very clear that when MDMA is combined
[02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:04.300]   with quality talk therapy,
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:07.540]   that the outcomes are looking tremendously positive.
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:09.540]   It's by no means a miracle cure,
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:11.660]   it is by no means perfect,
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.800]   and time will tell what problems if any arise
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:19.060]   from the short or long-term use of MDMA in this context.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:20.620]   But I think it's remarkable
[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:23.140]   that anywhere from two to three sessions with MDMA
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:24.980]   and talk therapy have been shown
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:28.140]   to significantly reduce PTSD symptoms,
[02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:31.940]   and in some cases completely eliminate PTSD symptoms
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:33.940]   in such a wide range of patients
[02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:37.100]   and in patients that have experienced both PTSD
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:38.780]   and these other comorbid disorders.
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:39.980]   I think it's really remarkable.
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:40.980]   It's very exciting.
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:42.060]   And I look forward to seeing
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:44.160]   what the next round of data produce.
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:46.720]   So as is often the case on this podcast,
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:49.860]   today we went into a lot of detail about a subject.
[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:52.900]   MDMA is this incredible compound synthesized,
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:54.620]   as far as we know, first by humans,
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:57.980]   not by plants, not by aliens, but by humans.
[02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:02.060]   And that produces big increases in dopamine and serotonin
[02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:07.060]   to create these highly motivated pro-social empathic states,
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:10.060]   meaning both empathy for others and for self,
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:12.400]   and that when applied in the context
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.380]   of psychiatric challenges like PTSD and addiction
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:19.760]   is proving to create a lot of relief for a lot of people
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:22.100]   where other forms of drug therapy
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:26.400]   or combination drug and talk therapy had failed before.
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:29.460]   We talked about some of the potential neurotoxicity issues.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:33.380]   I don't think that is a resolved issue just yet,
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:36.380]   although the bulk of data in humans and non-human primates
[02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:39.340]   point to the fact that at reasonable doses,
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:41.560]   and we talked earlier about what those are,
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:45.400]   at reasonable doses, when not combined with other drugs,
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:49.020]   does not appear that MDMA is exceedingly neurotoxic
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:51.380]   and it may not be neurotoxic at all.
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:53.420]   Of course, one needs to be exceedingly cautious
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:57.260]   when thinking about the use of any sympathomimetic.
[02:13:57.260 --> 02:14:00.260]   They, of course, can be neurotoxic.
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:01.700]   Anything with methamphetamine in it
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.980]   has the potential to be neurotoxic.
[02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:06.380]   But of course, dosage matters, context matters,
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:07.700]   we talked about that.
[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:11.020]   And of course, the purity of drug matters.
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:12.840]   And again, I just want to reemphasize
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.580]   the fentanyl contamination of MDMA that's sold on the street
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:18.540]   and that is being used recreational
[02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:21.860]   is of very serious, potentially lethal concern.
[02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:23.680]   I also expect that there will be a lot of interest
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:25.540]   in these clinical trials that MAPS is doing.
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:27.200]   So again, you can find links to that
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:28.860]   in the show note captions.
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:31.840]   And I think in general, we should acknowledge
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:34.700]   that we are a very interesting and important time
[02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:39.320]   in human history for the treatment of psychiatric disorders
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:41.200]   and for neuroscience generally,
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:43.000]   because whether or not we're talking about psilocybin
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.000]   or LSD or ayahuasca or ketamine or today's topic of MDMA,
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.360]   regardless of what drug and neurotransmitter
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:53.620]   and neuromodulator systems are involved,
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:54.880]   what we're really talking about
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:57.320]   are ways to access neuroplasticity,
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:00.200]   the nervous system's incredible ability to modify itself
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:01.740]   in response to experience.
[02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:05.120]   Ideally to be modified in adaptive ways
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.400]   that make it function better.
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.460]   So that's really the crux of what talk therapy
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.740]   and drug therapies are about.
[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:12.160]   That's what the goal of using MDMA
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:14.520]   as a clinical tool is all about.
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:17.200]   And in that sense, I find MDMA to be
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:20.000]   an incredibly interesting and important topic.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.660]   And I hope you did as well.

[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:55.800]   Not so much during today's episode,
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:58.500]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:15:59.960]   we discuss supplements.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:02.200]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:04.300]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:06.200]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:09.000]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.860]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:12.160]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:13.660]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:14.840]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:17.160]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:27.600]   And at all those places,
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.340]   I discuss science and science-related tools
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:31.260]   for mental health, physical health, and performance,
[02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:33.700]   some of which overlap with the science and tools
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:35.540]   that are discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:38.060]   but much of which is distinct from the information covered
[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:39.240]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:43.160]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:49.680]   It's completely zero cost,
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:53.160]   where we provide podcast summaries as well as toolkits.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:57.240]   The toolkits are short lists in PDF form
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:59.960]   of things that you can do to improve, for instance,
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:03.800]   sleep, or neuroplasticity, or dopamine regulation,
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:06.480]   or deliberate cold exposure, or fitness, and on and on.
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.240]   Again, all of that is available at zero cost.
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:11.520]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.480]   scroll down to newsletter, and provide your email.
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:15.480]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:17.000]   So if you're interested in those toolkits
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.240]   and the neural network newsletter,
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:21.320]   again, that's available at HubermanLab.com.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.600]   Thank you again for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:25.400]   all about MDMA.
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:27.640]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:29.440]   thank you for your interest in science.
