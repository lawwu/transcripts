[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440]   - Over the months, we've had a steady stream of emails,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.760]   probably over 50 by now,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.760]   all on the question of discerning
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.600]   when it's time to leave a certain church.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.400]   So many scenarios factor into a decision like this,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.580]   and it makes it really hard, I know,
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.600]   to answer the question with much specificity
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   in a podcast like this,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.920]   but maybe you can put some categories out there,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.100]   Pastor John, for listeners.
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.560]   What are some general guidelines or broad categories
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.760]   you would introduce for someone who is asking
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.320]   whether it's time to leave a local church?
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.120]   - One of the reasons that it's difficult
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.760]   is because we don't find explicit instances of this
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.720]   in the New Testament, and the reason we don't
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.080]   is because the letters of the New Testament
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.520]   are written to one church in a city,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.680]   not several churches in the city
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.040]   among which Christians are circulating.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.800]   It treats the church in Corinth or Thessalonica
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.240]   or Philippians as one church in the city,
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.720]   and the letters that are written to several churches,
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.640]   those churches are in different cities,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.560]   and so it's not about people moving from one to the other
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.500]   unless they're moving in the city.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.660]   So that's the reason the Bible is so silent.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.760]   The development of the church hasn't gotten to the point yet
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.600]   where there are this unbelievable multiplicity
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.240]   of local churches to choose from in any locale.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.760]   So the way I think we go about answering the question
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.040]   is by asking what the church is so that you can test,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.440]   is the church being the church here,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.720]   or is it defective to a degree
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.960]   that I should go to another one?
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.040]   And the four things that I would mark
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.280]   as defining what the church is,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.880]   number one, it's leaders, elders, pastors,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.240]   whatever that church calls them,
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.160]   New Testament calls them elders or overseers or pastors.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   They minister the word of God fully and faithfully.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.060]   Number two, they minister the Lord's Supper and baptism.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.480]   And number three, they exercise church discipline,
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.080]   excluding from membership,
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   those who walk in a way that contradicts the gospel
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   or brings reproach upon the Lord.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   And four, they love each other and they love the community
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.880]   and they're seeking to win the lost
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.520]   and reach the nation's mission of the church,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.360]   in other words.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   So any one of those four could be missing and serious
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.500]   and therefore lead a person to consider
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.760]   looking for another church.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.200]   The problem is, and I'm sure that's why
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.560]   we've gotten all these emails,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.840]   is that it's just never that black and white.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.560]   Here's a church with only three of its four traits,
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.400]   I'm leaving.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.080]   It's just never ever that easy,
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.840]   especially when it comes to the doctrine of the church
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.580]   and the ministry of preaching.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.000]   So preaching can be defective in lots of ways.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.840]   It can be unclear, it can be disorganized,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.020]   it can be incomplete, it can be imbalanced,
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.400]   it can be unfaithful to the text, it can be shallow,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.040]   it can be mingled with too much self and on and on and on.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.960]   It's just never nice, clear, black and white,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.400]   oh bad, I have a warrant to leave.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.160]   It's not that crystal clear.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.000]   So as I've tried to think of something helpful
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.840]   to say to people that have asked me this
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.400]   lots of times over the years,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.500]   here's what I've come up with.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.280]   When the weaknesses or the errors or the sins
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.760]   of the preacher or the preaching and the teaching
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.560]   reach a kind of combined extent,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.260]   in other words, all those different ways of possible defects
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.260]   they combine to the extent that mature Christians
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.020]   that you consult, not worldly ones,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.760]   but mature brothers and sisters that you consult with
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.720]   think your faith and obedience would be damaged
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.680]   if you stayed and your usefulness there
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.700]   doesn't outweigh the pitfalls, you're free to go.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.000]   And I wanna say free to go to a church.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.440]   You're not free to go nowhere.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.280]   Not being in a church is not a New Testament option.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.280]   To belong to Christ is to belong to a body of believers,
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.600]   defective or perfect, there aren't any perfect ones.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.480]   And so if there's no church,
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.360]   I mean, if you're living in a little town
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.920]   and you go into a church and you feel like
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.720]   they've left the gospel, what do you do?
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.240]   Well, you don't say church doesn't matter.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.160]   You seek out a few other believers
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160]   and you do your best to gather as a church,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.560]   win other people to Christ,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.400]   seek the blessing from a distance of the churches
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.320]   that you know, but you never leave hastily.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.600]   You never leave without serious prayer
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.520]   or consulting with other believers,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.360]   mature spiritual believers.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.040]   You never leave without talking to the leaders
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.080]   about why you're considering leaving
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.880]   and taking your time and praying about it with them.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.240]   And you always strive for peace, even when you must go.
