[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.160]   We begin in the great state of Florida.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.840]   Welcome to the show.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.720]   How can I serve you today?
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.620]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.420]   I wanted to learn something about Lady Bird Deeds, what are the pros and cons, if you
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.440]   know anything about it in Florida, it seems like a good way to get to know the people
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.000]   to transfer house on passing
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.280]   or like a transfer in debt designation.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.200]   But other than that,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.860]   if you know of any other alternatives to that.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.680]   What was it you wanted to know about?
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.980]   What?
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.380]   Ladybird Deeds in Florida.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.980]   Ladybird Deeds.
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.060]   I don't know anything about a Ladybird Deed
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.360]   by that name.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.980]   Is there a more official name
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.940]   or something that it's called?
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.800]   Like a living estate trust
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.040]   to transfer like a primary residence real estate.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.820]   So just a revocable living trust
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.760]   that holds a house.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.760]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.760]   Yes.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.540]   Okay.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.580]   Just doing a quick little bit of reading here
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.680]   to make sure.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.080]   All right.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.140]   So certainly know what
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.820]   about a living trust,
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.640]   but it looks like this is something specific.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.440]   So a Ladybird Deed,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.400]   also known as an Enhanced Life Estate Deed,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.960]   is a type of legal instrument used in Florida
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.200]   and some other states in the United States
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.500]   to transfer real property,
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.020]   such as a house or land,
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.860]   while retaining certain rights and protections
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.900]   for the grantor,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.880]   the person transferring the property.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.400]   Ladybird Deeds are a specific form of life estate deed
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.260]   that offers unique advantages
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.920]   in estate planning and property transfer.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920]   So ownership and control,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   the person creating the Ladybird Deed,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   the grantor retains full ownership and control
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   of the property during their lifetime.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   So they can sell, mortgage, make other changes, etc.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   without needing the consent of the beneficiaries.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   The grantor maintains a life estate in the property,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   right to live in, use the property, etc.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   Beneficiaries, the Ladybird Deed designates one
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   or more beneficiaries who will automatically inherit
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   the property upon the grantor's death.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.920]   The beneficiaries have no rights to the property
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   during the grantor's lifetime,
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   but they receive the property without going through
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   the process of the transfer.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.700]   So that's a good thing.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   They're not going through the probate process.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   Avoiding probate, yep, avoids probate.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   Unlike some other forms of deeds,
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.700]   a Ladybird Deed can be revoked or modified by the grantor
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.700]   during their lifetime, giving flexibility and control
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700]   over estate planning.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   Medicaid planning.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   Ladybird Deeds are often used in Medicaid planning
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   because they allow the grantor to retain Medicaid eligibility
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700]   while still preserving the right to transfer the property
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   to beneficiaries outside of probate.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700]   It's important to note that the term,
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.700]   that the name Ladybird Deed is not a legal term,
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.480]   but rather a colloquial name that is sometimes used
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   to refer to this type of deed due to its rarity.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   Ladybird Deeds can be complex legal instruments,
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   Okay, I'm up to speed.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.480]   So go ahead with your question then.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   - That was just, if you were familiar with this type of deed,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   you want to find out if there's any alternative to this
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.480]   or if it's really a good option for its purpose.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   - Is this something that you're trying to do yourself
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.480]   in your own planning or in your family in some way?
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.480]   - Yes.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   - Okay, and what's this--
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.260]   - For my own time, for instance.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.260]   - Okay, and who owns the house?
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260]   Tell me a little bit about the situation.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260]   - Husband and wife.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.260]   - Who is the husband and wife?
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260]   Is this your house that you're living in?
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.260]   - I'm myself, yes.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260]   - Okay, and how would this type of arrangement help you?
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.260]   - Help children to avoid a probate on the house.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260]   - Is that the only goal that you have,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   the only thing you're trying to accomplish?
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.260]   - Yes.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260]   - Okay, well then that's easy,
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260]   and I would not go in the direction of this
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.040]   based upon what you are doing.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   and you're trying to do this for the purpose of the house.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.040]   - Yes, and I think that's a good point.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   I think that's a good point.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   I think that's a good point.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   and you're trying to do this for the purpose of the house.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   - Yes, and I think that's a good point.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   and you're trying to do this for the purpose of the house.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   - Yes, and I think that's a good point.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   and you're trying to do this for the purpose of the house.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   - Yes, and I think that's a good point.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   and you're trying to do this for the purpose of the house.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   - Yes, and I think that's a good point.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   and you're trying to do this for the purpose of the house.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   - Yes, and I think that's a good point.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   and you're trying to do this for the purpose of the house.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   - Yes, and I think that's a good point.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   - Okay, so you're saying that you're trying to do this
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   for the purpose of the house,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.020]   probate, all you need to do is put the house into just a very simple trust, just a standard
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.680]   revocable living trust, and the house will avoid probate. And boom, done. There's nothing more to
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.720]   it than that. So why would you need to retain a life estate in the property rather than just
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:28.520]   simply moving the property into a trust, a simple trust? My basic understanding was that this was a
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.840]   cheaper, simpler way in Florida and some other states to achieve the same purpose
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.920]   if trusts were not necessary for other property or accounts. Do you have other property or accounts?
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.300]   Not the accounts that wouldn't have a beneficiary designation on them that would
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.360]   achieve the purpose of avoiding probate. How much would it cost you to do a ladybird deed
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.780]   as compared to a simple revocable living trust?
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.820]   I mean, it looks like there's a bunch of forms that are like generic forms that you can download
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.340]   that are like standard forms for this. And recording is very cheap. Like,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.400]   I think it's under $200. How much is the house worth that you own?
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.040]   Probably around $800,000, $850,000. How old are you?
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.160]   36. Okay. Well, I would,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.620]   so listen, I'm not an estate planning attorney. I know a good bit about estate planning,
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:40.620]   but I'm not a Florida estate planning attorney. I don't understand why you would be working on
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.180]   this at the age of 36 unless you have some specific life-threatening condition or you
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.360]   or your wife have some kind of specific life-threatening condition. I don't think
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.140]   that this kind of planning is necessary in a situation like yours. And I don't think that
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.220]   you should cheap out when it comes to proper legal advice, especially when you're dealing with
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:11.380]   almost million-dollar assets. So the idea of taking your $800,000 house and using forms and
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.680]   things that you get on the internet and $200 filing fees to me is a nightmare. And I can't
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.300]   imagine any attorney or any financial professional thinking that that's a good idea. I don't think
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.720]   that avoiding probate is particularly important to most people. The primary reason to avoid
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.520]   probate is to maintain privacy over your estate. Is that very important to you for some reason,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.300]   to maintain privacy? Yes, it is. But also in Florida,
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.500]   the probate can be from 12 months to 18 months. So that is also important.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.380]   Right. But if you have a simple house, this is not a difficult and time-consuming thing. I mean,
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.400]   if you've got millions of dollars in businesses and whatnot, okay, fine. But
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.560]   if all the rest of your assets have beneficiary designations and you own a house,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.200]   and presumably you would own the house jointly with your wife,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.780]   are you the sole owner of the house or do you own it jointly with your wife?
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:12.140]   Jointly. Okay. So you already have a joint ownership there. So the house is going to
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:18.420]   pass by joint ownership. At 36 years old, you're hopefully 40 to 60 years away from your death.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:27.260]   And so this is not something that is likely to happen. If you pass, if you die now, your house,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.580]   your wife would inherit the house as the joint owner. Sounds to me with the noise in the
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.240]   background, like you and she have young children. And so the biggest problem is not avoiding probate.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:47.320]   The biggest problem is how do I have proper management of the house so that the house is
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.680]   managed for the benefit of the children by my trustee for my children's trust? That's your
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.660]   biggest issue. Do you have a will and do you have a trust in the
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.240]   will for the benefit of your children already? Yes, we do have a will.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.360]   Okay. And so what are the terms of your will? If you die today, what happens to your house?
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.120]   They're designated governance.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.640]   Okay. And it goes directly to your children? Do you have a trust that is the, do you have a
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.120]   springing trust, a testamentary trust in your will that comes into being at your death?
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:35.160]   Um, property, um, defined and like basically the accounts defined that already have designations on.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.960]   So the will is going to catch up for accounts that do not have a benefit for your designation.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:46.960]   Okay. Well, the normal use of a life estate is to help the grantor get rid of property
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.920]   for the purposes of some form of specific estate planning,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.620]   often either taxes or Medicaid planning. And the short article that I find here on a lady,
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:04.320]   bird deed, it seems like it's probably a Medicaid planning tool. And the idea is I want to get rid of
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.720]   my ownership in the house, but I still want to have control. That's evidently what this kind of
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.580]   deed offers. And I want to maintain a life estate. I want to maintain the right to live in this house,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.120]   even though I no longer own it. And so none of those seem to me to be applicable in any way to
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.240]   your situation. And the only reason I've heard you say that this is something you would pursue
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.600]   is simply due to the fact that you're not going to be able to live in this house.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.200]   It might be cheaper than a revocable trust. Is that correct?
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.020]   Correct.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:41.360]   Okay. So to me, with all the caveats that I stated, that it could be that I'm ignorant
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.220]   on this in some way, this does not sound like something that I would pursue.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.760]   The normal use of a life estate would not apply to your situation as a 36-year-old father
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:57.440]   owning an $800,000 house that you own jointly with your wife and have young children. I don't
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:06.160]   see the applicability in any way of a life estate. If you want to establish a trust,
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:12.360]   I think a traditional revocable living trust is probably a better solution. It is simpler
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:21.220]   and does not involve this particular bifurcation, this separation of the life estate of the
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.300]   grantor with the actual property control. And so I've never had one of these deeds, so I don't know
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:27.560]   if...
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.920]   If it's a problem, but I would not want to be involved in this unless there was a clear
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:40.200]   and compelling concern. I would not worry about avoiding probate at 36 years old unless you
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.240]   specifically know that you're facing some kind of medical condition or something that means you're
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.560]   likely to die soon. Avoiding probate is not a concern. Now, again, you say I have privacy
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.540]   concerns. Sure, that's fine. But I don't want to be involved in this unless there was a clear
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:04.760]   but you're unlikely to die at 36. And so I would just skip this altogether. Own the house yourself
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:12.960]   in joint ownership with your wife, especially given the fact that you're in Florida, you will
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.460]   want to do that so that you maintain the asset protection benefits. And I would think that a
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.620]   significant reason not to make this kind of transfer would be that you would lose out on
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.020]   the generous homestead exemption benefits for asset protection in the state of Florida.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.000]   So I would just say own the house with you and your wife. Have in your will what happens to the
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.460]   property and who manages it for the benefits of your children. If you desire, just set up a simple
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:45.660]   testamentary trust in your will and maybe set up your own living trust that's available for you
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:52.220]   that you could transfer your house into in the future if you wanted to. But this seems extremely
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.820]   premature for a 36-year-old to be working on this. Now, fast forward, maybe you're 76.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:03.300]   And you're still living in this house and you want to change the ownership and control of it
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:09.720]   and maintain a life estate. That's for some reason that I'm open to it, but I can't see
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:21.780]   any application of this for a 36-year-old. Thanks, Joshua. I actually think the reason
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.980]   I was thinking about this is because it had to do with family members passing recently.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:37.020]   In the last two years. And it's actually another feature, I think, of this deed to have privacy
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:45.580]   because they're recorded like it's a public record who's on the deed who we would transfer to.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.900]   But good point. Thank you. Yeah, my pleasure. Again, I could be ignorant on this. I'd never
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:57.180]   heard of a ladybird deed until you asked me the question. I'm just, I know the basics of life
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.900]   and trust, et cetera, but I don't know what a ladybird deed is. So I could be ignorant. If you
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.860]   find out that I'm ignorant, then let me know. But from what you're describing, I can't see any use
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:12.320]   of it, at least for a compelling reason. I would say this with anything. Anything you're going to
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.740]   do, make sure that you can make the clear and compelling case for it as to why it's necessary
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.740]   and important for you. Anything else? No, that's it. Thank you.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.400]   Wonderful. We go on to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.780]   Hey, is that me? That's you. Go. Great. Joshua, this is Wayne from Birmingham. Welcome.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:41.280]   I had two potential questions I wanted to ask you. I am seriously thinking about taking your
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.680]   advice and going to Canada to open a Canadian bank account. Great. And I wonder if you might
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.340]   be able to give some sort of granular detail about what I might expect in the visit,
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.420]   you know, the funds that I take, what form should they be in, what denomination,
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:04.720]   you know, the amount, just various things like, you know, to help me maybe plan a little bit.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.300]   Sure. Absolutely. So the only thing that is really different than opening any other bank
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.720]   account in the United States is that normally the Canadian banking system works on an appointment
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:23.020]   basis. So it's not strictly necessary. You could just simply go to Canada and open an account,
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.740]   but they often do want to take an appointment in advance.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.540]   And so that's, you know, you call up a local branch of whatever bank you're
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.500]   interested in, and it can be any bank that you're interested in. I don't have a,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.060]   I try not in public to make any kind of specific recommendation of one bank versus another.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.860]   Basically, any of the big, large, well-known Canadian banks are about the same as the
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:50.120]   difference between Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, et cetera, in the United States. Like,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.700]   okay, it's a bank. They all work about the same. And so you find a branch that's going to be
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.380]   convenient based upon your travel plans.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.420]   And, you know, if you're in Toronto, then there's a bazillion of them. If you're in a smaller town,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:07.380]   there's a few of them. And then I would call them up and just simply say, hey, I'd like to open a
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.660]   bank account. Can I make an appointment with you for Tuesday at 10 o'clock? And they'll make an
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.980]   appointment with you. When you go to the meeting, you need to take your identification. You'll need
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:21.040]   to take your passport and identification. You'll need to have your documents ready, just like you
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.300]   would in the United States. There is no privacy or secrecy involved with the process in any way.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:57.340]   So you can take your passport and identification. You can take your passport and identification. You'll need to have your
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:27.320]   ID card. You can take your passport and identification. You can take your passport and identification. You'll need to have your
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:57.300]   ID card. You can take your passport and identification. You can take your passport and identification. You'll need to have your
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:27.280]   ID card. You can take your passport and identification. You'll need to have your ID card. You can take your
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:57.260]   ID card. You can take your passport and identification. You can take your passport and identification. You'll need to have your
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:03.060]   forms telling the US government how much money you have, what accounts it's in, etc. And then
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:09.720]   they will reconcile those documents with the annual disclosure, the annual reports that the
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.840]   Canadian bank will file to the US government about the existence of your account, its balances,
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:21.300]   etc. at their banking institution. And so, from a functional perspective, it's really,
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:27.200]   really simple. And it's just like opening an account in the United States. It's just difficult
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.100]   the first time. And then after you do it, it's like, that was simple, super easy.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:38.480]   Yeah. Okay. So, just US dollars cash is fine to go with. Okay. And one specific thing,
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:44.820]   I was looking at the different banks. I see that there's a TD Ameritrade sort of a bank there,
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:50.700]   which is a familiar name in the US. And apparently, they have a big US presence as well.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:57.140]   Is that still a separate Canadian bank as far as our purposes that we're
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:05.100]   interested in? So, this is where it's hard for me to know what to say. So, first, let me go back to
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:12.660]   why I think people should have a foreign bank account. Basically, there are a few reasons.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:19.640]   Reason number one is you want to have the ability to access foreign currencies in a simple and
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:27.080]   straightforward way in case something happens with your own home currency. And I should state for the
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.120]   record that I do not expect or predict massive problems of the US dollar. I expect the US dollar
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:38.580]   to maintain its leading status as the reserve currency of the world. I'm not expecting that
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:44.520]   anything bad is going to happen to the US dollar in the current time. But I like to be prepared
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.620]   in case something did happen that I don't expect because I don't place a lot of stock in my
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:55.920]   predictions. Rather, I try to have insurance policies against possible scenarios, plausible
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:02.080]   especially scenarios that could hurt me quite a lot. And if I'm living in the United States and
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.000]   I'm earning money in the United States and I'm saving and I'm banking in the United States,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.140]   and if the situation in my home country were to go bad for some reason, then that could wipe me out
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.700]   if I don't have the ability to access other places where things are better. And so, if I lose my job
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:26.960]   and there is massive inflation and a banking crisis, etc., then I'd like to have the ability to access some other options
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.220]   and potentially protect some of my savings and move to another currency. Now, I'm also not trying
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:39.780]   to make any kind of official endorsement of any particular currency. The Canadian economy has
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.760]   plenty of problems. The Canadian dollar is different than the US dollar. And I'm not claiming
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.940]   that it's better, but it is different. And one of the things that I've noticed over the years in
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:56.900]   studying financial collapse has been that many kinds of currency crises and collapses, they don't seem to be contagious.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:05.260]   In the same way that they're not contagious. Now, the hard thing about this is factoring in the United States.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:10.600]   There's a saying that goes around in international circles with regard to the United States is that
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:17.620]   if the United States sneezes, the world catches a cold. Basically, because the US economy is so enormous
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.960]   and so influential in terms of the US dollar, etc., that when there are problems in the United States,
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.380]   that can impact the world on a global basis.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.780]   And so I want to be cautious about that and recognize that if the United States dollar
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.960]   faced problems, there would probably be many issues that many currencies could face.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:42.640]   And so I don't want to make bigger claims than I can defend. However,
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.900]   if I look at places that have experienced financial collapse, my favorite example is Venezuela,
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:56.780]   that when you had an absolute hyperinflation of the Venezuelan currency due to a complete and total collapse,
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:03.260]   over the last decade, that didn't automatically mean that the Colombian peso or the Brazilian real
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:09.940]   were immediately affected. Those currencies had their own issues. Now, Colombia's had inflation,
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.720]   Brazil had inflation, they had separate issues, but they didn't have the same issues that Venezuela
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:22.680]   had because the currency crisis was largely a national system. And so my idea is that by having
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.720]   access to foreign currencies, then if somebody has a currency crisis, they're going to have to
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:34.320]   have to have a currency crisis. And so I want to have quick access to something else that may not
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.440]   be better for the long term, but will at least allow me to diversify out of my primary currency.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:46.280]   And so for someone in the United States, this can be any other country, but Canada is easy because
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.580]   it's an English-speaking country. It's easy for Americans to go to. That's why I recommend it,
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.740]   not because it's the best, but because it's the easiest. If somebody is living in another place,
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.660]   if a Canadian is living in Canada, the exact same way that I would recommend it,
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.780]   advice applies going the other way, that a Canadian should have a US dollar account in the
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:08.620]   United States. A German should have a US dollar account in the United States or a British account
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:14.120]   in the British pound, something that is different than your primary currency. So that's the first
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:19.780]   big thing is I want to have access and the ability to transfer some of my savings out of my primary
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:25.880]   currency into another currency in case there's some kind of overall issue going on. The second
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:35.940]   thing is so that I have the potential of avoiding currency controls if there starts to be a collapse.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:41.360]   One of the things that governments always do when they face a financial crisis or collapse
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.340]   is they start to impose currency controls. And those currency controls are in different
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.980]   expressions. So they'll limit the amount of money you can get out of an ATM.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.540]   They'll limit the amount of a cash transaction that you can engage in. And they'll limit your
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:02.400]   money in and out of the country. Now, these are not the kinds of things that happen in the first
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.640]   few days of a crisis, but they do happen quickly in a severe crisis because they are kind of a
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.360]   standard part of the playbook. And so in order to escape these currency controls, you have to have
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.100]   an infrastructure established in advance of how to get your money out of that country. How do you
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.600]   get substantial amounts of money out of the country? And again, here I go to a place like,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:34.200]   Argentina. Argentina is in financial crisis about every few years. And they go on for a few years,
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.180]   and they seem to come out, and it's back in again. And so right now, I forget the details
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.380]   of the Argentinian currency controls, but they're very, very strict in terms of how much money you
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:49.820]   can go with. And if you want to get more money out of the country, there's something like a 50%
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:56.340]   tax. I haven't checked these numbers recently, but there's a huge tax on it. So I had a client I
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.060]   worked with some time back that inherited a house in Argentina, and she was working to sell the
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.580]   house, and she wanted to take the money out, but there was no way for her to get the proceeds
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.400]   of the house out of Argentina because of these controls, that either she would lose half of it
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.100]   to taxes, or she'd basically have to shuttle the money out, $10,000 at a time in her pocket,
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.400]   making trips back and forth across the border. And of course, that's not suspicious.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:25.840]   And so how do you do this? Well, when those currency controls go up, you already have to have
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.800]   your assets on the other side of the wall, otherwise you're in trouble. And so how do you
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.880]   do that? Well, in normal times, you make a bank transfer, and it's super simple and easy. But that
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.920]   bank transfer has to be to an account that is established, that you can do it. And if you have
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:48.820]   that set up, then you can just open up your phone, do a wire transfer, and transfer your savings out.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.980]   And so what I particularly like for Americans is for Americans to have a US dollar account in
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.300]   another country. And so what I particularly like for Americans is for Americans to have a US dollar
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.040]   And the example that I give is basically a tunnel account.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:05.860]   And so think back to the early stage of the coronavirus crisis.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.520]   There was a period the first couple months of it where things were looking really bad.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:19.100]   There was massive uncertainty about the situation, the health situation, huge uncertainty about
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.500]   the economic situation.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.220]   Stock market was crashing.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.300]   Inflation looked bad, et cetera.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.400]   And I started to say, is this it?
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.820]   This is bad, but is this it?
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.380]   Well, the great thing is I didn't really have to choose.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:37.520]   All I needed to do was, if I wanted to protect my money, was transfer some of my savings
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.140]   from my US dollar account in the United States to my US dollar account in a foreign country.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:49.320]   And by so doing, I now know that at any point in time, I can just simply transfer out of
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.360]   the US dollar into foreign currencies in other countries.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.220]   But I don't have to take that bet.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.180]   In advance, I could just keep the money sitting in a US dollar account in another country.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:07.760]   So those are the two basic reasons why I think it's smart to have foreign accounts is for
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.360]   those reasons.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.460]   So now let me come back with that logic.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:17.080]   Let me come back to the argument about using a bank like TD Bank that has operations both
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.380]   in the United States and in Canada.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:24.900]   For the first one, it would certainly be no problem because if I want the ability to,
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:32.460]   if I want the ability to interact in Canadian dollars easily, then I can just simply transfer
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.140]   my money from a US dollar account to a Canadian dollar account within TD Bank.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.240]   That's super simple and easy.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.040]   It's the second one where I'm not so sure.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:46.700]   And the basic reason comes down to what kind of pressure could a government place upon
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.260]   an institution that is doing business within its borders?
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.280]   And what would that government do?
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.120]   And so...
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:54.540]   So...
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:29:00.720]   The TD Bank, you know, they have a Canadian operation and they have a US operation.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:10.120]   But am I really going to feel confident about them as a choice in the scenario that I described
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.860]   if my home country imposes currency controls and says that I can't transfer money out of
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.140]   the country or I can't do it without an enormous tax of some kind?
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.580]   I'm not going to feel so confident with them.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.540]   Now, is this likely to happen?
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.520]   I hope not.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.300]   I hope this never happens in my lifetime.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.440]   But in terms of planning, that doesn't feel really good.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.980]   Hope is not a strategy.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.980]   And so if I had my choice, I would much...
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:41.680]   So if I had my choice, I'd much rather deal with a tiny little bank on the far side of
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:48.120]   the planet that has zero contact whatsoever with the US government, US entities, et cetera.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.380]   It doesn't even accept Americans.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.140]   That would be great.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.420]   Except that I'm American, so I'd have a problem.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.420]   So everything...
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.820]   Everything different from that is kind of a sacrifice of some kind.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:04.880]   So if I could find a little bank in Canada, in far north Saskatchewan that had four branches
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.460]   and bank with them and they had zero contact with the US government, but they would give
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.940]   me a bank account, well, that to me would be more ideal for the second option than for
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.640]   the...
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.120]   Than for the...
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.180]   Than TD Bank that has operations in both countries.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.800]   Now, realistically, if this actually happened...
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.960]   If this actually happened, I would not feel super comfortable with my money in any
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.340]   Canadian bank for the long term.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:37.160]   So if this ever did happen to the degree that I've described, then the idea of having money
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.320]   in the Canadian bank is just a temporary thing anyway.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:45.640]   If this ever happened, I would be very quickly on the airplane and I'd be opening accounts
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.100]   in three other countries, preferably one or two of them that are enemies of the United
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.100]   States in order to control...
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.460]   In order to protect my money further.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.860]   So where do we...
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:02.040]   How do we make the decision in that scheme of kind of paranoia?
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.300]   Like, where is the right way?
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.900]   Well, clearly, something is moving us in the right direction, but why would I voluntarily
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:15.520]   choose a bank that has close ties with the United States?
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:21.400]   Again, for you from a US perspective, if I have the same choice of another bank that
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:21.520]   has...
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.780]   Doesn't have such close ties.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:31.900]   And so my answer to that is I would only do that if I valued in some way the service part
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.120]   of it.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:39.080]   So if there's a TD Bank branch right in my town that's super convenient, and if they
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.920]   can go and they could give me a Canadian dollar account, and I know I'm not fully protected,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.800]   but I get benefits from using them, then sure, go for it.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.500]   But I don't know how to tell someone else where to come down on that.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.520]   I don't know how to tell someone else where to come down on that level of paranoia.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.320]   I prefer to keep my commentary to kind of the broadly acceptable stuff, people who aren't
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.780]   in legal trouble, people who aren't trying to hide money, because to me, that's kind
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.380]   of the rational insurance policy that I advocate for.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.380]   But you make your own decision.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:17.580]   I would just say, why would I choose a bank that has close ties within my home country?
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.680]   Because that creates more of a sphere of influence.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.380]   Now, the final thing...
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.580]   And I'm repeating slightly what I said, but the US government is a different beast than
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.240]   most other countries' governments.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.780]   So let's say that you lived in...
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.760]   You were from Ukraine, and you were trying to protect your assets.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.540]   Well, the Ukrainian government is not a global superpower.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.260]   And so you can pretty much interact in any country that you want.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.760]   United States, on the other hand, is a global superpower.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.300]   The world's largest spy, collecting information everywhere, putting sanctions on everyone,
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.980]   and so I don't think that...
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.820]   I don't think you're going to avoid the US government.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.060]   And so is all of this useless?
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:05.380]   I don't think so, but I certainly am open to the criticism that, listen, we're dealing
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.440]   with the US government here.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.160]   So does it really...
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.420]   And then the point is that Canada is a close neighbor and a very close ally, one of the
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:17.480]   five I countries for the United States, where basically they interact, they share all information,
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.580]   they make decisions largely together.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.700]   And so...
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:26.520]   I'm not sure that your money is safe in any Canadian bank in that kind of difficult situation
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.220]   that I described.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:32.140]   But I would still choose something that is more separate from the country because it
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.340]   would make me sleep better at night.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.660]   Good, good.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.440]   That's kind of what I was thinking, and that's really helpful.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.620]   I sure do appreciate that.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:47.520]   My hope is that this action step is one that you will take, and then it'll feel so good
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.680]   to have done something, and after you've lived with it for a couple of years, then you'll
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.260]   go ahead and set up a second plan, and you'll pick another country that's a little bit more
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.520]   distant from the United States and have one more backup plan, and you'll practice transferring
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.820]   your money around, et cetera, and just get used to the idea.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:07.860]   Because at the end of the day, this is only weird for you primarily because you are an
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.220]   American.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.980]   It is not weird for the vast majority of the world.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:20.660]   Americans are so accustomed culturally to being king of the world that this kind of
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:30.020]   and to having an enormous country and an enormous variety of people to choose from in terms
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:35.700]   of providers that Americans don't generally think about accessing world services.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.140]   And so that's the only reason this is weird for you.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:46.040]   But on the whole, once you do it, what you'll discover is that it's no weirder to do what
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.900]   I've described than it is for you to have a bank account.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:35:20.620]   And so that's the only reason this is weird for you.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.760]   Happy to give you that speech if you want it.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.020]   And so this will only feel weird to you until you do it.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.240]   And then once you do it, then you'll be welcomed into the world that most of the world lives
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.680]   in, which is to say, yeah, of course, I keep a bank account in my home country.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.600]   Obviously, I need to pay my bills, and it's where my home currency is, et cetera.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:43.940]   But it's also perfectly normal for me to access the world's best banks that are in specific
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.520]   banking jurisdictions and keep some of my assets in those banks.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.600]   And so it's just unusual for Americans because we don't really have that kind of
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:50.660]   money.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.520]   We don't really think that way.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:55.940]   There hasn't ever been a reason to do it, and it's kind of a new mindset for someone
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.320]   like you.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.000]   Okay.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.680]   Just need to take that first leap.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.040]   Yep.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:00.440]   Yep.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.560]   Take the first leap, and once you do it, it'll feel better.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.000]   Anything else?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.980]   If you've got time.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.240]   I do.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:07.480]   I do.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.920]   You're my last caller on the show, so go ahead.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.660]   Okay.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:10.920]   Great.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.360]   Recently, I listened to your talk about 529 plans and the changes that have happened and
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:16.780]   all that.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.300]   And you mentioned the concept of a family bank.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.620]   During your talk.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.140]   And I wondered if you might expand on that a little bit.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:31.260]   When I talked about that, I was not referring to setting up any kind of legal entity.
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.280]   So first, let's make that clear.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.980]   I wasn't suggesting that we establish a family bank that's registered as a bank.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:45.200]   I've read a few articles on some of that, and I find those concepts interesting, but
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.700]   I don't have any personal experience.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.400]   You can do this oftentimes if you go and set up.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.920]   We will be talking about this at my Panama event coming up.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.000]   Mikel Thorup is going to talk about setting up family foundations and whatnot in Panama
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.760]   as an option and some of the global options.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   He has more expertise in that area than I do.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.260]   And I've read interesting options about things like that.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.480]   So there's always a way to it.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:13.440]   I was referring to it just in a general sense that if you look at one of the reasons you
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.740]   have value, and by the way, there are plenty of instruments that you can do for this in
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.880]   the United States as well.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.880]   So you can set up trusts within the United States in various countries.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.160]   In Florida, you could do a trust that has a duration of as long as 360 years.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.380]   You can have assets in those trusts of various kinds.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.340]   You have full and complete separation.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:39.240]   This is a useful planning form for things like protecting your children against the
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:39.880]   risk of divorce.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:45.180]   If your family assets are held in a trust and your children are beneficiaries of the
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.460]   trust, and then your child gets divorced, well, the child's divorcing spouse is not
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.520]   going to receive the trust.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.100]   The child doesn't have access to them, et cetera.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:58.920]   And so there's lots of legal instruments that can be used to do this type of thing, both
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:05.460]   nationally in the United States as well as internationally for those who wish to establish
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.300]   the legal entity.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:12.060]   In my conversation, usually where I talk about this, I think of it just more conceptually.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.020]   The idea being that as parents, we want our children to succeed.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.400]   And how can we nurture that success?
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.340]   In my own childhood, I was raised under the pull yourself up by your own bootstraps philosophy.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.660]   And partly that was because we didn't have a lot of money.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:36.520]   Also, partly it was just due to the culture, the culture that my parents grew up in, where
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.000]   it was very much a pull yourself up by your own bootstraps culture.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.200]   And that was passed along to me.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.120]   And I was proud of that.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.640]   And just examples of the practical application of that was that when I was in high school,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.480]   every year from seventh to twelfth grade, because I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:50.600]   was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant,
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:50.640]   I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:50.680]   I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant,
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.620]   I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant, I was a tenant,
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.780]   I chipped in $100 a month to my private school tuition.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:03.240]   I don't know if my dad actually needed it or if he did that because if he did that because
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:07.580]   if he needed the money or if he did that because it was part of building responsibility in his
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:07.900]   children.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:08.700]   I should ask him.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.620]   But anyway, that was something that we did.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.440]   There were times, and there was a year I didn't have the money and it wasn't like he pulled
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.100]   me out of school, but it was a good discipline.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.540]   I paid for my college.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.520]   I put myself through.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.880]   But as I became a financial planner and started interacting with people who were wealthier,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.420]   I discovered that this pull yourself up by your own bootstraps philosophy, while certainly
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:34.180]   something I was proud of, was probably not the best way to create success.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.060]   And the example that I look back on and see so clearly now.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:46.860]   Is how much it harmed my potential in college by spending all my time working to pay for
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.160]   my tuition rather than taking advantage of other opportunities.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.680]   So without going into the whole story, my first year of college, I had three different
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:40:00.140]   jobs that probably totaled, I don't know, 25 hours a week of work, but it was allowed
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.920]   me to pay my pay cash for my freshman year of tuition at a private school.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.040]   In my senior year, I was working 40 hours a week and it allowed me to pay cash for my
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.440]   student loans while working my way through school.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.540]   But I remember hearing about things like internships.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:20.140]   And at the time, I couldn't even conceive of how somebody could afford to work for free.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.460]   I was like, why would you go and work for free?
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.200]   I got to make money.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.800]   How, why on earth could, like, how do you go and take an unpaid internship?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.580]   Today, I look back and I realize what I gave up.
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:33.440]   You know, if I had taken today, if I'm coaching somebody, I would say it's far less important
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.020]   for you to, for you to, you know, take an unpaid internship.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:44.200]   Go and get income than it is for you to go and get experience and connections.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.060]   And an unpaid internship and strategically chosen internships are a phenomenal way for
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.780]   you to get ahead very, very quickly.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.440]   But you can't do that when you're trying to work all the time.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.100]   A similar example that I had was in starting businesses.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:03.620]   Not being from a wealthy background, I never had a family bank to fall back and rely upon.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.960]   Rather, I've always had to bootstrap everything that I have done.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.600]   That's fine.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.000]   You know, I'm.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:08.440]   I'm proud of it.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:08.820]   It's good.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.820]   You learn lessons.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.780]   But it's also pretty painful sometimes to have to bootstrap everything.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.180]   And you look and you follow the trajectory of people who are wealthy.
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.180]   And you study the way the wealthy people do it.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.460]   And you see you can use money as a very effective form of leverage.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:27.320]   And so I've wrestled with that a lot over the years of trying to reconcile my own predilection
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.260]   for, you know, bootstrapping and the value of doing it yourself.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.500]   And the discipline and the character and all of this, that stuff, as compared to kind of
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:37.940]   doing things.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.680]   The easy way.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:44.600]   And what I've realized is the balance between those things is like the proper balance is
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.400]   probably something like this is to have a family bank for a wealthy for a wealthy family
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:57.640]   to have a family bank where you will basically support children in any productive use of
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:57.980]   money.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:04.080]   So paying for education, certification, et cetera, very productive, very important.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.400]   And having being able to write big checks out of the family bank and.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:13.180]   Allow a child to be free of student loans, et cetera, seems really important in the grand
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.940]   scheme of things.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:19.600]   Having a family bank to invest into things like businesses and knowing that in your children,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:25.280]   knowing that they have access to money, I think is it probably a good thing.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.260]   Having access to a family bank for purchasing valuable assets, things like purchasing a
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.600]   house seems to me a really good thing.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.480]   And I don't think that I think it's kind of a dumb.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.500]   Expression of that.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.860]   Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps mentality that comes out of the American culture where
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.280]   we try to tell children basically do it on your own.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.580]   And I can't find a lot of evidence for that.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:55.580]   I appreciate and respect when children learn to be productive, but the whole do it on your
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.860]   own philosophy and I'm not going to help you and you got to do it yourself just to me seems
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:07.540]   like a really bad way of slowing down the results that your children get in life.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:13.680]   There are dangers to it, but that's where I've come to after about two decades of thinking
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:21.120]   about it is that it seems dumb to me to to to like we want our children to not be just
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:26.140]   spoiled kids who drive around in the brand new Ferrari that we gave them and smoke crack
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:32.280]   like that's obviously stupid, but for somebody who is motivated and focused and productive
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.640]   knowing that the family has money and that money is here for your use.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.980]   And you are that you as the child or the steward of that money and you have to take it and
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.260]   you have a responsibility to grow it and pass it down through the generations to me seems
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:54.280]   really really important and that's what I want to do and I guess I don't have any other
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:54.880]   colors at the moment.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.360]   So I'll just make two more comments.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.260]   I think a lot about the saying there's a proverb in the in the Old Testament of the Christian
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.540]   Bible.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:07.200]   It says that a righteous man leaves an inheritance to his children's children and I think that's
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:14.060]   a good expectation for us is that I believe that God has designed that the wealth of the wicked
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.120]   is stored up for the righteous in the fullness of time.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.720]   The wealth of the wicked will all flow to the righteous and one of the expressions of
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.260]   righteousness is the accumulation of money and as that money is accumulated.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:31.720]   It needs to be invested in into a controlled environment where it can be made to continue
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:37.600]   to grow and to continue to be productive and if we have the moral foundation that
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:43.100]   says that I am not here exclusively for myself exclusively to consume consume consume.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:52.060]   I have a moral obligation to to accumulate wealth and to accumulate so much wealth that
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:57.460]   not only can I take care of me myself can not only can I take care of my wife not only
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:02.580]   can I take care of my children, but I've been productive enough to be able to accumulate
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.580]   a surplus for my children's children and then that should be the expectation that I
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.580]   have.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.480]   That should be the expectation for every generation.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.980]   Certainly some may not measure up to that but that should be the expectation that should
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.820]   be the vision that we hold that as a man right.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.080]   I want to tell my children.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.540]   I don't I don't interact with them much on money beyond their own personal usage of it.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.260]   But in the fullness of time my charge to them is going to be listen.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:30.380]   You are a sheets and what that means is you have an obligation to be productive with the
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.880]   inheritance that you have received from your father from your grandfather and from the
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.560]   generations before you and then to accumulate.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:44.680]   And to see to the advancement for your own children and your grandchildren Etc.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:50.440]   And this family is here to grow and to impact the world and to be effective and productive
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:56.060]   and your righteous stewardship of the resources with which you've been entrusted is expected
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:02.080]   of you and one one part of that is that you are expected to use the advance that you have
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:07.540]   in life the many benefits and privileges that you have in life and to steward those for
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:12.740]   those who will come behind you and money is really important component of that and
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:18.320]   so like holding that expectation that you are going to be so productive that you accumulate
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.520]   money for your children's children.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:25.580]   I think is is a really important component of life.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:30.780]   The second thing that I have seen is I've been thinking a lot for the last it's last
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.780]   five years.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:36.460]   Probably I've been thinking a lot about demography birth rates Etc and this has been an acute
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.520]   interest over the last.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:44.220]   About 18 months of mine and we are living in depending on what country we're living
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:50.900]   in we're leaving in a population collapse or a population crisis and if you look back
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.020]   at this and you try to figure out what is happening.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:59.740]   There are many factors that are happening right obviously industrialization modernization
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:07.500]   secularization just growing wealth Etc. There's many issues that are happening but if you
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.780]   talk to young people you listen to young people.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.680]   One of the things that they say one of the reasons they don't want to get married and
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.160]   they don't want to have children is due to proceed to their their financial instability.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.000]   Now I would like to push back to those young people and simply say you don't have financial
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.500]   instability you simply think you have financial instability but it's not actually financial
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:34.060]   instability but setting that aside let's just assume that that they're right that they have
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.480]   financial instability so his father is in his grandfathers.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:46.260]   It is our job if we want to see to the continuance of our family if we want to see to the thriving
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:51.540]   of our progeny it is our job to solve these problems for them and so maybe if we went
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:56.840]   back hundreds of years or thousands of years we could help our grandson so a tent out of
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.620]   Buffalo hide so he and his bride could have their own space.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:07.460]   Well we don't live in that world but what world do we live in we live in a world in which we need to help our children and in order
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:16.000]   for them to have babies we need to help them at a very young age because one of the one of the impacts of birth
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:23.980]   rates has one of the big impacts on birth rates seems to be simply the delaying nature of of life
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:37.440]   and of pregnancy and so put very simply if we went back two generations I'm I'm skeptical of the idea that it was ever all that common for teenagers early teenagers
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:49:07.420]   to marry and to have children that's kind of a perception that if we went back into the ancient times that a girl was married at fourteen I'm skeptical of that for a couple of reasons but set that aside let's go back a few generations it was certainly rather common for a girl to marry at twenty well if a girl marries at twenty she has twenty years in which she can have babies then it became common for the age of marriage to be delayed past college okay so now it became it was common for
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:37.400]   a girl to be married at twenty five that's okay if she gets married at twenty five she can still possibly have fifteen years to have babies she can still have a number of babies during that period of time well now it's become common to push past that twenty five and to say not only does a girl have to graduate high school and graduate college but now she's got to be secure in her career and she needs to really have built her career and and then she can go ahead and get married and have babies if she wants to well that pushes the age to say thirty
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:50:07.380]   right late twenties and thirty well that means that she is very unlikely if we look across all of all women as a group it's very unlikely that she's going to have time or physical ability for her to have more than perhaps one or two babies because it becomes much more difficult for her to conceive children it becomes much more difficult for her to birth children and it becomes much more difficult for her to have
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:37.360]   time to even have multiple children and so if you look in the west and you listen to american women that self report that they don't have as many babies as they themselves desire to have to me a big factor is just this extension of life now there are good reasons for this extension of life meaning that for a girl to you know i'm always imagine my daughter right placing her trust let's say she's twenty years old for her to place her trust and some twenty two year old guy and say yes
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:51:06.380]   he's ready to support me et cetera that's got to be some guy for her to feel good about that there aren't there aren't doesn't seem like we're very good at producing twenty two year old men who seem very powerful and strong and in this position to to be good husbands and fathers et cetera there's some and i think we can do better but at its core if we want to help our children to have more babies and to have them in a healthy way where they come into stable homes et cetera
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:37.320]   we're so that so that so that you know they're not raised in a catastrophe we want the best outcome possible one way we could do that is by investing our money into them and some things that we could do is number one help to minimize financial obligations get rid of student loan debt eliminate you know big amounts of consumer debt and help them to have houses because that's the other thing that people all over the world say and all the all the data seems to bear it out that if someone's living in a tiny apartment it's very difficult to want to have you know three
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:52:07.300]   children in the tiny apartment it's like maybe one maybe but on the other hand if someone's living in a reasonably sized house in a place where they can handle children the american birth rates are much higher than they are around the world probably due to our suburbs that people feel like they can handle more children in their housing then if we want that then one way we can do that is help our children to get into bigger houses earlier and so in talking about this on twitter recently i made the recommendation like baby boomers if you want if you want grandkids
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:37.280]   and children then once your children are basically adults as quickly as possible give them your house and move you move into the small apartment don't expect your children to live in this tiny little apartment while they're just getting their feet under themselves and then expect them to also give you five grand babies like that's not going to work but if you got this big old house that's paid for etc why don't you and your wife move into the little apartment and move your children into your big house whichever whichever child is married say hey come on into this house and if you got another child married and help your next child get into the little apartment
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:53:07.160]   get the house and so these are some of the things that we can and should do with our money that are really good investments into our family culture and into our future the future of our nation the future of our people and so that's kind of the bigger the expression of the vision is that there's this stupid idea that we've adopted largely in financial planning in the united states that the goal of money is to have more of it and that proper investing of money is to buy mutual funds and stocks
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:37.240]   i think that's stupid the goal of money is to invest it into into people into things that matter and the primary people that we need to look at first are our neighbors and our our family and our neighbors the people that we're interacting with on a continual basis and and we need to take care of ourselves we need to save money we need to use all of the good financial planning tools that are at our disposal but at its core we should use those tools that are going to help us to advance the cause of our financial planning
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:54:07.220]   of righteousness and justice through those that we can most impact in our close circles around us so those are my thoughts about a family bank is that i want to i want to be productive enough to see to my own needs and the needs of my wife and my children but i want to use money to help my children get ahead faster so that their children can get ahead faster so that their children can get head faster and this is antithetical to the to the very egalitarian american society
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:37.200]   that we live in um this is much more familiar to those who appreciate the aristocracy uh but while i am sympathetic and i see myself as a man of the people i really think there's a lot more value to thinking of ourselves as the aristocracy and in the same way that the aristocracy once saw themselves as having an obligation to use their position rightfully for the advancement of all men uh especially
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:55:07.180]   including the common men to me that seems the right way to handle and this touches even on the whole question of privilege uh and and and how to deal with it in the modern world i have no interest in living in a world in which we go to privileged people and try to take away their privilege in order to bring everyone down that's to me sounds like a hell world but i have a great deal of interest in teaching people that to whom much is given much is required and much has been given to me and therefore i expect
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:37.160]   much to be required of me and so i am invest i want to invest into my children in the traditional vein of a nobleman or an aristocrat and and and to do that in a full and righteous way so that my children understand that we are different but we are different not for our own hedonistic consumption we are different because of the duty that is expected of us for our privilege in the world so
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.220]   much to be required of me and therefore i have a great deal of interest in teaching people that to whom much is given much is given to me and therefore i have a great deal of interest in teaching people that to whom much is given much is given to us for our privilege in the world so
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:56:07.140]   much to be required of me and therefore i have a great deal of interest in teaching people that to whom much is given much is given to us for our privilege in the world so let me stop but that those are my comments yeah that's good i also like that that it kind of fits in with this concept about leaving money to kids when they can most use it you know when they're still relatively young instead of waiting until they're in their sixties and you die and leave them lots of money when it doesn't help them that much right yeah yeah all right well thanks so much great um my pleasure and um thank you for calling in so
