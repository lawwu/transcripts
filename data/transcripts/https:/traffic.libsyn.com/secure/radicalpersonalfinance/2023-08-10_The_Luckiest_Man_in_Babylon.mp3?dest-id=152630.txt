[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]   At the head of his caravan proudly rode Sharunada, the merchant prince of Babylon.
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.020]   He liked fine cloth and wore rich and becoming robes. He liked fine animals and sat easily upon
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.560]   his spirited Arabian stallion. To look at him, one would hardly have guessed his advanced years.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.100]   Certainly, they would not have suspected that he was inwardly troubled. The journey from Damascus
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.900]   is long and the hardships of the desert many. These he minded not. The Arab tribes are fierce
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.060]   and eager to loot rich caravans. These he feared not, for his many fleet-mounted guards were a
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.640]   safe protection. About the youth at his side whom he was bringing from Damascus was he disturbed.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.180]   This was Hadangula, the grandson of his partner of other years, Eridgula, to whom he felt he owed
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.080]   a debt of gratitude.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.560]   Which could never be repaid. He would like to do something for this grandson, but the more he
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.920]   considered this, the more difficult it seemed because of the youth himself. Eyeing the young
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.040]   man's rings and earrings, he thought to himself, he thinks jewels are for men. Still he has his
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.500]   grandfather's strong face, but his grandfather wore no such gaudy robes. Yet I sought him to come,
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.160]   hoping I might help him get a start for himself and get away from the wreck his father has made
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.920]   of their inheritance.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.720]   Hadangula broke in upon his thoughts.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.780]   Why dost thou work so hard, riding always with thy caravan upon its long journeys?
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.480]   Dost thou never take time to enjoy life?
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.260]   Sharunada smiled.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.720]   To enjoy life? he repeated.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.060]   What wouldst thou do to enjoy life if thou wert Sharunada?
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.720]   If I had wealth equal to thine, I would live like a prince. Never across the hot desert would I ride.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.840]   I would spend the shekels as fast
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.900]   as I could.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.340]   As they came to my purse, I would wear the richest of robes and the rarest of jewels.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.700]   That would be a life to my liking, a life worth living.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.640]   Both men laughed.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.520]   Thy grandfather wore no jewels, Sharunada spoke before he thought,
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.000]   then continued jokingly, wouldst thou leave no time for work?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.980]   Work was made for slaves, Hadangula responded.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.820]   Sharunada bit his lip, but made no reply, riding in silence until the trail
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.600]   led them to the slope. Here he reined his mount, and pointing to the green valley far away.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.360]   See, there is the valley. Look far down, and thou canst faintly see the walls of Babylon.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.820]   The tower is the temple of Bel. If thine eyes are sharp, thou mayest even see the smoke from
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.600]   the eternal fire upon its crest. So that is Babylon? Always have I longed to see the wealthiest
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.740]   city in all the world, Hadangula commented. Babylon, where my grandfather started his career,
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.020]   his fortune. Would he were still alive, we would not be so sorely pressed.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.540]   Why wish his spirit to linger on earth beyond its allotted time?
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.960]   Thou and thy father can carry on his good work. Alas, of us neither has his gift.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.380]   Father and myself know not his secret for attracting the golden shekels.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.720]   Sharunada did not reply, but gave rein to his mount and rode thoughtfully down the trail to
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.660]   the valley. Behind them followed the people of Babylon, and they were all in the same place.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.440]   They followed the caravan in a cloud of reddish dust. Sometime later, they reached the king's
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.140]   highway and turned south through the irrigated farms. Three old men plowing a field caught
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.820]   Sharunada's attention. They seemed strangely familiar. How ridiculous. One does not pass a
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.280]   field after forty years and find the same men plowing there. Yet something within him said
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.080]   they were the same. One, with an uncertain grip, held the plow.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.820]   The others laboriously plodded beside the oxen, ineffectually beating them with their
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.660]   barrel staves to keep them pooling. Forty years ago he had envied these men.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.300]   How gladly he would have exchanged places. But what a difference now. With pride he looked back
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.400]   at his trailing caravan, well-chosen camels and donkeys, loaded high with valuable goods from
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.500]   Damascus. All this was but one of his possessions. He pointed to the plowers, saying, Still plowing
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.120]   the same field where they were forty years ago. They look it, but why thinkest thou they are the
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.000]   same? I saw them there, Sharunada replied. Recollections were racing rapidly through his
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.240]   mind. Why could he not bury the past and live in the present? Then he saw, as in a picture,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.500]   the smiling face of Arad Gula. The barrier between himself and the cynical youth beside
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.420]   him dissolved. But how could he help such a superior youth with his spendthrift ideas
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.260]   and bejeweled hands? Work he could offer in plenty to willing workers, but not for men who consider
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.440]   themselves too good for work. Yet he owed it to Arad Gula to do something, not a half-hearted
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.160]   attempt. He and Arad Gula had never done things that way. They were not that sort of men.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.400]   A plan came almost in a flash. There were objections. He must consider his own family
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.500]   and his own standing. It would be cruel. It would hurt.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.000]   Being a man of quick decisions, he waved objections and decided to act.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.240]   Wouldst thou be interested in hearing how thy worthy grandfather and myself joined in the
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.500]   partnership which proved so profitable? he questioned. Why not just tell me how thou
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.480]   madest the golden shekels? That is all I need to know, the young man parried.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.840]   Sharunada ignored the reply and continued, We start with those men plowing.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   I was no older than thou. As the column of men in which I marched approached, good,
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.640]   old Megiddo, the farmer, scoffed at the slipshod way in which they plowed.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.720]   Megiddo was chained next to me. Look at the lazy fellows, he protested. The plowholder makes no
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.040]   effort to plow deep, nor do the beaters keep the oxen in the furrow. How can they expect to raise
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.100]   a good crop with poor plowing? Didst thou say Megiddo was chained to thee?
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.800]   had Arad Gula asked in surprise. Yes, with bronze collars about our necks and a length of heavy
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.840]   chain between us.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.640]   Next to him was Zabado, the sheep thief. I had known him in Harun. At the end was a man we called
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.300]   Pirate because he told us not his name. We judged him as a sailor as he had entwined serpents tattooed
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.220]   upon his chest in sailor fashion. The column was made up thus so the men could walk in fours.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:52.520]   Thou wert chained as a slave? had Arad Gula asked incredulously. Did not thy grandfather tell thee
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.440]   I was once a slave?
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.540]   He often spoke of thee, but never hinted of this.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.740]   He was a man thou couldst trust with innermost secrets.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.860]   Thou too are a man I may trust. Am I not right?
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.360]   Sheru Nada looked him squarely in the eye.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.620]   Thou mayest rely upon my silence, but I am amazed. Tell me, how didst thou come to be a slave?
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.760]   Sheru Nada shrugged his shoulders.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.360]   Any man may find himself a slave. It was a gaming house and barley beer that brought me disaster.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.560]   I was the victim of my brother's indiscretions. In a brawl he killed his friend. I was bonded to
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.960]   the widow by my father, desperate to keep my brother from being prosecuted under the law.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.360]   When my father could not raise the silver to free me, she in anger sold me to the slave dealer.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.480]   What a shame and injustice! had Arad Gula protested. But tell me, how didst thou regain
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.780]   freedom? We shall come to that, but not yet. Let us continue my tale.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.880]   As we passed, the plowers jeered at us. One did doff his ragged hat and bow low, calling out,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:07.420]   Welcome to Babylon, guests of the king. He waits for thee on the city walls where the banquet is
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.080]   spread, mud bricks and onion soup. With that they laughed uproariously.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.780]   Pirate flew into a rage and cursed them roundly.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.100]   What do those men mean by the king awaiting us on the walls? I asked him.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.860]   To the city walls ye march to carry
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.640]   bricks until the back breaks. Maybe they beat thee to death before it breaks.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.120]   They won't beat me. I'll kill them. Then Megiddo spoke up. It doesn't make sense to me to talk of
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.840]   masters beating willing hard-working slaves to death. Masters like good slaves and treat them
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.320]   well. Who wants to work hard? commented Zabado. Those plowers are wise fellows.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.780]   They're not breaking their backs, just letting on as if they be. Thou can't get ahead,
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.920]   by shirking, Megiddo protested. If thou plow a hectare, that's a good day's work,
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:06.300]   and any master knows it. But when thou plow only a half, that's shirking. I don't shirk.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.100]   I like to work, and I like to do good work, for work is the best friend I've ever known.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.840]   It has brought me all the good things I've had, my farm and cows and crops, everything.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.700]   Yea, and where be these things now? scoffed Zabado. I figure it pays better to be smart.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.800]   And get by without working. You watch, Zabado. If we're sold to the walls, he'll be carrying the
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.860]   water bag or some easy job, when thou, who like to work, will be breaking thy back-carrying bricks.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:45.060]   He laughed his silly laugh. Terror gripped me that night. I could not sleep. I crowded close
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.960]   to the guard rope, and when the others slept, I attracted the attention of Godoso,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.420]   who was doing the first guard watch. He was one of those brigand Arabs,
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.000]   the sort of rogue who, if he robbed thee of thy purse, would think he must also cut thy throat.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.580]   Tell me, Godoso, I whispered, when we get to Babylon, will we be sold to the walls?
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:14.200]   I want to know, he questioned cautiously. Canst thou not understand? I pleaded. I am young. I want
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.420]   to live. I don't want to be worked or beaten to death on the walls. Is there any chance for me
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.800]   to get a good master? He whispered back.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:31.520]   I tell something. Thou, good fellow, give Godoso no trouble. Most times we go first to slave markets.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.480]   Listen now. When buyers come, tell them you good worker, like to work hard for good master.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:44.540]   Make him want to buy. You not make him buy. Next day you carry brick. Mighty hard work.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.720]   After he walked away, I lay in the warm sand, looking up at the stars and thinking about work.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.460]   What Megiddo had said about it being his best friend,
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.320]   made me wonder if it would be my best friend. Certainly it would be if it helped me out of this.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.960]   When Megiddo awoke, I whispered my good news to him. It was our one ray of hope as we marched
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.200]   toward Babylon. Late in the afternoon, we approached the walls and could see the lines of men
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:17.340]   like black ants climbing up and down the steep diagonal paths. As we drew closer, we were amazed
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:23.200]   at the thousands of men working. Some were digging in the moat. Others mixed the dirt into mud bricks.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:29.640]   The greatest number were carrying the bricks in large baskets up those steep trails to the mason.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:36.420]   Overseers cursed the laggards and cracked bullock whips over the backs of those who failed to keep
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:42.800]   in line. Poor, worn-out fellows were seen to stagger and fall beneath their heavy baskets,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.460]   unable to rise again. If the lash failed to bring them to their feet,
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:53.260]   they were pushed to the side of the paths and left writhing in agony. Soon they would be dragged down
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:00.820]   to join other craven bodies beside the roadway to await unsanctified graves. As I beheld the ghastly
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:06.560]   sight, I shuddered. So this was what awaited my father's son if he failed at the slave market.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.080]   Godoso had been right. We were taken through the gates of the city to the slave prison,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.360]   and next morning marched to the pens in the market. Here the rest of the men huddled in fear,
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.420]   and only the whips of our guard could keep them moving so the buyers could examine them.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.040]   Megiddo and myself,
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.640]   eagerly talked to every man who permitted us to address him. The slave dealer brought soldiers
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.240]   from the king's guard who shackled Pirate and brutally beat him when he protested.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.440]   As they led him away, I felt sorry for him. Megiddo felt that we would soon part. When no
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.080]   buyers were near, he talked to me earnestly to impress upon me how valuable work would be to
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.000]   me in the future. Some men hate it. They make it their enemy. Better to treat it like a friend.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.140]   Make thyself like it. Don't mind because it is hard. If thou thinkest about what a good
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.180]   house thou build, then who cares if the beams are heavy and it is far from the well to carry
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.600]   the water for the plaster? Promise me, boy, if thou get a master, work for him as hard as thou
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:10.520]   canst. If he does not appreciate all thou do, never mind. Remember, work well done does good
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.640]   to the man who does it. It makes him a better man. He stopped as a burly farmer came to the
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:23.060]   enclosure and looked at us critically. Megiddo asked about his farm and crops, soon convincing him that he would be
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:28.800]   a valuable man. After violent bargaining with the slave dealer, the farmer drew a fat purse from
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:35.200]   beneath his robe, and soon Megiddo had followed his new master out of sight. A few other men were
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.600]   sold during the morning. At noon, Godoso confided to me that the dealer was disgusted and would not
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.160]   stay over another night, but would take all who remained at sundown to the king's buyer. I was
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.020]   becoming desperate when a fat, good-natured man walked up to the wall and inquired if there was a
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.860]   baker among us.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:58.080]   I approached him, saying, Why should a good baker like thyself seek another baker of inferior ways?
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.740]   Would it not be easier to teach a willing man like myself thy skilled ways? Look at me. I am young,
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.740]   strong, and like to work. Give me a chance, and I will do my best to earn gold and silver for thy
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:14.340]   purse. He was impressed by my willingness and began bargaining with the dealer who had never
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:20.800]   noticed me since he had bought me, but now waxed eloquent on my abilities, good health, and good
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.900]   disposition. I felt like a fat, good-natured man. I was impressed by my willingness, and began bargaining
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.620]   with the dealer who had never noticed me since he had bought me. He was impressed by my willingness,
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:23.740]   and began bargaining with the dealer who had never noticed me since he had bought me.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:30.460]   At last, much to my joy, the deal was closed. I followed my new master away, thinking I was the
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:38.080]   luckiest man in Babylon. My new home was much to my liking. Nana Naid, my master, taught me how to
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.740]   grind the barley in the stone bowl that stood in the courtyard, how to build the fire in the oven,
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.660]   and then how to grind very fine the sesame flour for the honey cakes.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:52.820]   I had a couch in the shed where his grain was stored. The old slave housekeeper, Swasti, fed me
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.100]   well and was pleased at the way I helped her with the heavy tasks. Here was the chance I had longed
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.520]   for to make myself valuable to my master, and I hoped to find a way to earn my freedom. I asked
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.920]   Nana Naid to show me how to knead the bread and to bake. This he did, much pleased at my willingness.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.140]   Later, when I could do this well, I asked him to show me how to make the honey cakes, and soon I
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:20.720]   was doing all the baking. My master was glad to be idle, but Swasti shook her head in disapproval.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.740]   "No work to do is bad enough," said Nana Naid. "I am a good man, and I am a good man. I am a good
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.260]   man, and I am a good man." "I am a good man," she said.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.620]   I felt it was time for me to think of a way by which I might start to earn coins to buy my
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.660]   freedom. As the baking was finished at noon, I thought Nana Naid would approve if I found
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.340]   profitable employment for the afternoons and might share my earnings with me.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:43.860]   Then the thought came to me: why not bake more of the honey cakes and peddle them to hungry men
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.060]   upon the streets of the city? I presented my plan to Nana Naid this way: "If I can use my
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.660]   afternoons after the baking is finished to earn for thee coins, would it be
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.700]   only fair for thee to share my earnings with me, that I might have money of my own to spend for
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.980]   those things which every man desires and needs?" "Fair enough, fair enough," he admitted.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.060]   When I told him of my plan to peddle our honey cakes, he was well pleased.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:13.300]   "Here is what we will do," he suggested. "Thou sellest them two for a penny. Then half of the
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.900]   pennies will be mine to pay for the flour and the honey and the wood to bake them.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:22.580]   Of the rest I shall take half, and thou shalt keep half." I was much pleased by his generous
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:29.140]   offer, that I might keep for myself one-fourth of my sales. That night I worked late to make a tray
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.580]   upon which to display them. Nana Naid gave me one of his worn robes that I might look well,
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:40.820]   and Swasti helped me patch it and wash it clean. The next day I baked an extra supply of honey cakes.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:45.860]   They looked brown and tempting upon the tray as I went along the street, loudly calling my wares.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:52.500]   At first no one seemed interested, and I became discouraged. I kept on, and later in the afternoon, as many
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.100]   men became hungry, the cakes began to sell, and soon my tray was empty.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.220]   Nana Naid was well pleased with my success, and gladly paid me my share.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.780]   I was delighted to own pennies.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.180]   Megiddo had been right when he said a master appreciated good work from his slaves.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.900]   That night I was so excited over my success I could hardly sleep and tried to figure out
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.820]   how much I could earn in a year and how many years would be required to buy my freedom.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:22.420]   As I went forth with my tray of cakes every day, I soon found regular customers.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.580]   I was so happy to see my father, who was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.460]   I was so happy to see my mother, who was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my father.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.620]   I was so happy to see my mother, who was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my father.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.020]   I was so happy to see my mother, who was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my father.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.100]   I was so happy to see my mother, who was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my father.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.140]   I was so happy to see my mother, who was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my father.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.580]   I was so happy to see my mother, who was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my father.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.740]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.740]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.180]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.180]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.660]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.060]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.420]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.020]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.300]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.740]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.660]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.020]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.100]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.100]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:20.980]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.220]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.260]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.100]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.220]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.820]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.260]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.660]   My father was a very good cook, and I was so happy to see my mother.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.620]   He was leading three donkeys loaded with vegetables to the market.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.100]   "I am doing mighty well," he said.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.620]   "My master does appreciate my good work, for now I am a foreman.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.100]   See, he does trust the marketing to me, and also he is sending for my family.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.740]   Work is helping me to recover from my great trouble.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.180]   Someday it will help me to buy my freedom, and once more own a farm of my own."
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:59.700]   Time went on, and Nana Naid became more and more anxious for me to return from selling.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.580]   He would be waiting when I returned and would eagerly count and divide.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.500]   He would also urge me to seek further markets and increase my sales.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.700]   Often I went outside the city gates to solicit the overseers of the slaves building the walls.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.580]   I hated to return to the disagreeable sites, but found the overseers liberal buyers.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.940]   One day I was surprised to see Zabato waiting in line to fill his basket with bricks.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:29.380]   He was gaunt and bent, and his back was covered with welts and sores from the whips of the overseers.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.500]   I was sorry for him and handed him a cake.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.460]   He was so angry that he crushed the cake into his mouth like a hungry animal.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.740]   Seeing the greedy look in his eyes, I ran before he could grab my tray.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.460]   "Why dost thou work so hard?" Arad Gula said to me one day.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.620]   "Almost the same question thou asked of me today, dost thou remember?"
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.700]   I told him what Megiddo had said about work and how it was proving to be my best friend.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:00.020]   I showed him with pride my wallet of pennies and explained how I was saving them to buy my freedom.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.420]   "When thou art free, what wilt thou do?"
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.620]   he inquired.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.380]   "Then," I answered, "I intend to become a merchant."
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.340]   At that he confided in me something I had never suspected.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:18.180]   "Thou knowest not that I also am a slave. I am in partnership with my master."
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:25.060]   "Stop," demanded Harangula. "I will not listen to lies defaming my grandfather. He was no slave."
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.540]   His eyes blazed in anger.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.340]   Sharunada remained calm. "I honor him for rising above his
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.940]   misfortune and becoming a leading citizen of Damascus. Art thou his grandson cast of the same
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:43.700]   mold? Art thou man enough to face true facts, or dost thou prefer to live under false illusions?"
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:51.380]   Harangula straightened his saddle. In a voice suppressed with deep emotion, he replied,
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.580]   "My grandfather was beloved by all. Countless were his good deeds. When the famine came, did not
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.300]   his gold buy grain in Egypt, and did not his caravan bring it to Damascus and distribute it to
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.500]   the people so none would starve? Now thou sayest he was but a despised slave in Babylon."
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.780]   Had he remained a slave in Babylon, then he might well have been despised.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.660]   But when through his own efforts he became a great man in Damascus, the gods indeed condoned
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.140]   his misfortunes and honored him with their respect, Sharunada replied.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.940]   "After telling me he was a slave," Sharunada continued,
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:31.220]   "he explained how anxious he had been to earn his freedom. Now that he had enough money to buy this,
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:37.060]   he was much disturbed as to what he should do. He was no longer making good sales and feared to leave
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:43.780]   the support of his master. I protested his indecision. Cling no longer to thy master.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.780]   Get once again the feeling of being a free man. Act like a free man, and succeed like one. Decide
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.380]   what thou desirest to accomplish, and then work will aid thee to achieve it."
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:22:01.140]   He went on his way, saying he was glad I had shamed him for his cowardice. One day,
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.220]   I went outside the gates again, and was surprised to find a great crowd gathering there.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:11.140]   When I asked a man for an explanation, he replied, "Hast thou not heard? An escaped slave who murdered
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.540]   one of the king's guards has been brought to justice, and will this day be flogged to death
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:21.540]   for his crime. Even the king himself is to be here." So dense was the crowd about the flogging
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.820]   post, I feared to go near lest my tray of honey cakes be upset. Therefore I climbed
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.060]   up the unfinished wall to see over the heads of the people. I was fortunate in having the
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:37.380]   view of Nebuchadnezzar himself as he rode by in his golden chariot. Never had I beheld such grandeur,
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:43.540]   such robes and hangings of gold cloth and velvet. I could not see the flogging, though I could hear
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:49.460]   the shrieks of the poor slave. I wondered how one so noble as our handsome king could endure
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.500]   to see such suffering. Yet when I saw he was laughing and joking with his nobles, I knew he
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:00.420]   was cruel, and understood why such inhuman tasks were demanded of the slaves building the walls.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:07.460]   After the slave was dead, his body was hung upon a pole by a rope attached to his leg so all might
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:15.940]   see. As the crowd began to thin, I went close. On the hairy chest I saw tattooed two entwined
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:24.820]   serpents. It was Pirate. The next time I met Arad Gula, he was a changed man. Full of enthusiasm,
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:30.900]   he greeted me. "Behold, the slave thou knewest is now a free man. There was magic in thy words,
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:56.500]   and thy power is the power of the Lord." I was overjoyed that I had been able, even in a small
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.820]   way, to repay him for the encouragement he had given me. One evening, I was in the city,
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.260]   and I saw the swasti coming to me in deep distress. "Thy master is in trouble. I fear for him. Some
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:11.380]   months ago he lost much at the gaming tables. He pays not the farmer for his grain nor his honey.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.580]   He pays not the moneylender. They are angry and threaten him."
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.940]   "Why should we worry over his folly? We are not his keepers," I replied thoughtlessly.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:25.780]   "Foolish youth, thou understandeth not. To the moneylender didst he give thy title to secure a
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.260]   loan. Under the law he can claim thee and sell thee. I know not what to do."
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.300]   "He is a good master. Why? Why should such trouble come upon him?"
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.980]   Not were swasti's fears groundless. While I was doing the baking next morning,
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:46.820]   the moneylender returned with a man he called Sasi. This man looked me over and said I would do.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:52.500]   The moneylender waited not for my master to return, but told swasti to tell him he had taken me.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.140]   With only the robe on my back and the purse of pennies hanging safely from my belt,
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.660]   I was hurried away from the unfinished baking. I was whirled
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.540]   away from my dearest hopes as the hurricane snatches the tree from the forest and casts
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:11.060]   it into the surging sea. Again a gaming house and barley beer had caused me disaster.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:17.860]   Sasi was a blunt, gruff man. As he led me across the city, I told him of the good work I had been
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:23.460]   doing for Nana Naid and said I hoped to do good work for him. His reply offered no encouragement.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:30.260]   "I like not this work. My master likes it not. The king has told him to send me to build a section of
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:36.020]   the Grand Canal. Master tells Sasi to buy more slaves. Work hard and finish quick.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.700]   How can any man finish a big job quick?"
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:47.060]   Picture a desert with not a tree, just low shrubs and a sun burning with such fury,
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:53.940]   the water in our barrels became so hot we could scarcely drink it. Then picture rows of men going
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:26:00.180]   down into the deep excavation and lugging heavy baskets of dirt up soft, dusty trails from day
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:07.460]   light until dark. Picture food served in open troughs from which we helped ourselves like swine.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:15.300]   We had no tents, no straw for beds. That was the situation in which I found myself.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:23.220]   I buried my wallet in a marked spot, wondering if I would ever dig it up again. At first I worked
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.740]   with good will, but as the months dragged on I felt my spirit breaking. Then the heat fever took
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.100]   hold of my weary body. I was so tired I couldn't sleep. I was so tired I couldn't sleep. I was so
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.220]   tired I couldn't sleep. I was so tired I couldn't sleep. I was so tired I couldn't sleep. I lost my
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:36.900]   appetite and could scarcely eat the mutton and vegetables. At night I would toss in unhappy
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.900]   wakefulness. In my misery I wondered if Zabato had not the best plan to shirk and keep his back from
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:48.980]   being broken and work. Then I recalled my last sight of him and knew his plan was not good.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:54.340]   I thought of Pirate with his bitterness and wondered if it might be just as well to fight
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:00.020]   and kill. The memory of his bleeding body reminded me that his plan was also
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:07.220]   useless. Then I remembered my last sight of Megiddo. His hands were deeply calloused from
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:14.100]   hard work, but his heart was light and there was happiness on his face. His was the best plan.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.940]   Yet I was just as willing to work as Megiddo. He could not have worked harder than I. Why did not
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.820]   my work bring me happiness and success? Was it work that brought Megiddo happiness or was happiness
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.940]   and success merely in the laps of the gods? Was I to work the rest of my life without gaining my desire
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.580]   and without happiness and success? All of these questions were jumbled in my mind and I had not
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:41.060]   an answer. Indeed, I was sorely confused. Several days later, when it seemed that I was at the end
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:47.700]   of my endurance and my questions still unanswered, Sasi sent for me. A messenger had come from my
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:53.620]   master to take me back to Babylon. I dug up my precious wallet, wrapped myself in the
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:59.860]   tattered remnants of my robe and was on my way. As we rode, the same thoughts of a hurricane
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:05.820]   whirling me hither and thither kept racing through my feverish brain. I seemed to be living the weird
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:13.240]   words of a chant from my native town of Harun. Besetting a man like a whirlwind, driving him
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:20.160]   like a storm, whose course no one can follow, whose destiny no one can foretell. Was I destined
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.580]   to be ever thus punished? For I knew not what? What new miseries and disappointments awaited me?
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.780]   When we rode to the courtyard of my master's house, imagine my surprise when I saw
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.660]   Arad Gula awaiting me. He helped me down and hugged me like a long-lost brother.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.780]   As we went our way, I would have followed him as a slave, should follow his master,
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.420]   but he would not permit me. He put his arm about me, saying, I hunted everywhere for thee.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.240]   When I had almost given up hope, I did meet Swasti, who told me of the moneylender,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:53.420]   who directed me to thy noble owner. A hard bargain he did drive and made me pay an outrageous price,
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.780]   but thou art worth it. Thy philosophy and thy enterprise have been inspiration to this new
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.320]   success.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:05.660]   Megiddo's philosophy, not mine, I interrupted. Megiddo's and thine. Thanks to thee both,
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:11.220]   we are going to Damascus, and I need thee for my partner. See, he exclaimed, in one moment thou
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:16.840]   will be a free man. So saying, he drew from beneath his robe the clay tablet carrying my title.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.920]   This he raised above his head and hurled it to break in a hundred pieces upon the cobblestones.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.020]   With glee he stamped upon the fragments until they were but dust.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.620]   Tears of gratitude filled my eyes.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.600]   I knew I was the luckiest man in Babylon.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:39.440]   Work thou see, by this, in the time of my greatest distress, didst prove to be my best friend.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:45.380]   My willingness to work enabled me to escape from being sold to join the slave gangs upon the walls.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.600]   It also so impressed thy grandfather he selected me for his partner.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:56.820]   Then Harangula questioned, was work my grandfather's secret key to the golden shekels?
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.540]   It was the only key he had when I
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:06.320]   first knew him. Sharunada replied, thy grandfather enjoyed working. The gods appreciated his efforts
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:14.040]   and rewarded him liberally. I began to see, Harangula was speaking thoughtfully,
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:21.920]   work attracted his many friends who admired his industry and the success it brought. Work brought
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:28.100]   him the honors he enjoyed so much in Damascus. Work brought him all those things I have approved.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.460]   And I thought work
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:35.060]   was fit only for slaves. Life is rich with many pleasures for men to enjoy,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:42.920]   Sharunada commented. Each has its place. I am glad that work is not reserved for slaves.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.300]   Were that the case, I would be deprived of my greatest pleasure. Many things do I enjoy,
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.300]   but nothing takes the place of work.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:59.120]   Sharunada and Harangula rode in the shadows of the towering walls up to the massive,
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.960]   bronze gates of Babylon. At their approach, the gate guards jumped to attention and
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:10.120]   respectfully saluted an honored citizen. With head held high, Sharunada led the long caravan
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:16.400]   through the gates and up the streets of the city. I have always hoped to be a man like my grandfather,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:22.580]   Harangula confided to him. Never before did I realize just what kind of man he was.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:29.300]   This thou hast shown me. Now that I understand, I do admire him all the more and feel more determined
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:34.100]   to be like him. I fear I can never repay thee for giving me the true key to his success.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:39.240]   From this day forth, I shall use his key. I shall start humbly as he started,
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.460]   which befits my true station far better than jewels and fine robes.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:51.560]   So saying, Harangula pulled the jeweled baubles from his ears and the rings from his fingers.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:59.220]   Then, reining his horse, he dropped back and rode with a deep respect behind
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.240]   the leader of the caravan.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:01.780]   Thank you for watching.
