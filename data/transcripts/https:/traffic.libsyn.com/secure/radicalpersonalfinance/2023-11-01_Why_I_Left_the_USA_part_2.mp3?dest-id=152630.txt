[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.080]   That sweater's so tight, it look like it's snapped between the legs.

[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.240]   And Paul Rodriguez.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.440]   What is it about old Mexican men? They could be missing a leg, they still want to get into a fight.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.740]   Hosted by my man Eric Blake in a special performance by Mario.

[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.580]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.580]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.780]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.500]   I am your host.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.360]   And on today's podcast, I continue the series on why I left the USA.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.560]   And I'm doing this series in order of least important reasons to most important reasons.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   But I think today's reason is going to be probably the most.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.520]   The most universal.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.880]   And although in my own mind, it's kind of the least important of my three big reasons,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.540]   that doesn't make it unimportant.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.240]   And I'm not actually sure that that ranking is true.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.000]   Because after all, we can lay out the idea that we're logical creatures and making careful decisions.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.820]   But at the end of the day, there's a little bit of whimsy and just moving on a lark in all of us.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.480]   And in terms of how and why I left the United States, there was no long-term plan.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.540]   The reasons, number two.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.240]   And one that I am going to mention were definitely part of my longer-term plan.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.180]   But at the end of the day, they had been in my thinking for some years.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.540]   And the reason I actually left was just that it was a convenient time to leave.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.460]   So let me not bury the lead anymore.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:24.520]   The reason I have left the United States and still have lived abroad is just a desire for adventure and interest.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.300]   And a desire to be prepared for opportunity.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.340]   And a desire to be prepared for opportunity in the world.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.000]   I see those two things as being very related, which is why I have joined them.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.140]   Life should be interesting.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.340]   Life should be as much of an adventure as you desire.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.760]   I'm not into the idea that, you know, that quote-unquote normal life is boring and to be escaped from, etc.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.020]   But at the end of the day, at the end of every year, at the end of every month, at the end of every decade,
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.140]   I think we should be able to look back on the last month or year or decade,
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140]   and have some interesting stories.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.140]   I don't think that every day is going to be an adventure in and of itself.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.140]   There are some days in which you sit down and rest.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:14.140]   Sometimes the hum-drum routine is a tremendous sense, gives you a tremendous sense of satisfaction and relaxation.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.140]   And so there's nothing wrong with routine.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.140]   I think there are different personality types.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.140]   Some people really derive great pleasure in routine.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140]   And I understand that very much.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.140]   I myself am not one of those people.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.640]   I'm a person.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.140]   I'm a person.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.140]   I myself am one of those people who enjoys variety in life.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.140]   And I want to live an adventure.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.140]   At the end of the day, when I do an assessment of basically my life's purpose,
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.140]   there are a few different components of that.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.140]   And one, for example, one of my most important senses of purpose,
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.140]   something that gives me a sense of purpose, is to say,
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.640]   "Is there an opportunity to make an impact on the world,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   an impact for good?
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   Can I sow a little bit of justice and righteousness into a corner of the world?"
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   I want an opportunity to love my neighbor of varying degrees.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.640]   I want an opportunity to impact my community.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   And I think that a good life is a life well lived,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.640]   is one where you have a handful of friends, a handful of family members.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   You love them.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   You encourage them.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   You have a community and you enjoy interacting with that community.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   That's a good life.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   There's a whole other element where,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.640]   at least I myself, crave a sense of adventure,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.640]   a sense of difference, and a sense also of impact in the world.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   I think a desire to make a difference on a bigger scale
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   or a desire to see something on a bigger scale
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   is something that is connected to us.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   And maybe it's not there universally,
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   but it is something that has always been there for me.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   There is a stereotype among my generation,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.640]   I being a millennial,
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.140]   that we understand,
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.140]   that we want to collect experiences and not things.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.140]   And we can make fun of that.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.140]   After all, collecting a bunch of experiences can just become a bunch more things.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.140]   I love passport stamps, for example.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.140]   And I always have to ask myself,
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.140]   "Am I just collecting passport stamps as another thing,
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.140]   or am I really genuinely investing into the experiences
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.140]   that those passport stamps represent in terms of reality?"
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.140]   But we want to enjoy experiences.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.640]   We want to live a variety of experiences.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   And it seems to me that one of the reasons people get old before their time
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.640]   is they stop living,
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   meaning they stop going after adventure,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   they stop pursuing goals that are important to them.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.640]   They take the easy road.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.640]   And that seems foolish to me.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   And so one of the ways that I believe that we age successfully
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   is to always make our future bigger than our past.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.140]   And that's something that we have to define for ourselves.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.140]   And for me, one of the ways that I myself want to make my future
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.140]   always bigger than my past
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.640]   is to make my future in some sense different than my past.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.140]   I have found that the joy of the pursuit of goals
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.140]   in new and different and meaningful contexts
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.640]   is more enjoyable and more meaningful
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.640]   than the achievement of specific goals in specific contexts.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   And so it's much more important for me
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.640]   to be focused on pursuing things that are new and different
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   that I have chosen
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   because it's the joy of the journey,
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   it's the actual pursuit of those things
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.640]   that is enjoyable.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   It's not the achievement, it's the pursuit.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   And so in order to have the ongoing joy of the pursuit,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   there should be variety and there should be changing
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.640]   and we should be setting new things that challenge ourselves in new ways,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.140]   new goals that require us to grow
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.140]   in order to accomplish and achieve them.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.140]   If we will set those goals,
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.140]   those goals that are different
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.140]   and require us to grow in order to achieve them,
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.140]   then each and every phase of life
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.140]   can be something that we take great value in.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.140]   And when we reflect back on different phases,
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.140]   we'll be able to differentiate phases
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.140]   from one from another.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.140]   Let me talk for a moment about memory,
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.140]   differentiation and the phases of life.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.140]   In financial planning,
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.140]   I have learned that a lot of people think about financial planning
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.140]   in a few basic phases.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.140]   So if you were to go and gather together a room full of,
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   you know, CFP test takers,
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.140]   they would frequently say,
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.140]   "Well, there's childhood or an ac--
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.140]   you know, we could combine childhood and adolescence
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.140]   and everything into basically an academic phase.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.140]   There's a phase in life in which you're going to school.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.140]   Then you get out and you have your career phase.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.140]   Then you have your retirement phase."
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.140]   And in the world of financial planning traditionally,
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.140]   as well as modern variations
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.140]   such as the early retirement movement,
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.140]   there's this intense focus on getting as quickly as possible
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.140]   from the work phase to the retirement phase
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.140]   because that's where the juice is.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.140]   That's where the joy is.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.140]   And over the years, I've thought a lot about this
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.140]   and worked with a lot of people.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.140]   I just think that's a woefully inadequate way
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   to approach life,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.140]   a woefully inadequate way to think about life.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.140]   We should have a lot more phases than just those.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.140]   So I appreciate how having children
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.140]   introduces different phases into my life.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.140]   We've got the, you know,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.140]   the married but no children yet phase.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.140]   That's a great phase.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.140]   Then you've got the baby phase.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.140]   That's a great phase,
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.140]   but has certain restrictions that don't exist later.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.140]   Then you've got the young children phase.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.140]   Then you've got the adolescents.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.140]   Then you've got your young adult phase.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.140]   Then you've got the grandchild phase, etc.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.140]   And so that all adds texture to life.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.140]   It makes life more interesting
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.140]   because you can embrace certain activities at one phase
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.140]   that you wouldn't generally embrace at a different one
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.140]   and enjoy a whole different life and lifestyle
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.140]   that is not always available to you.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.140]   But you can go beyond this.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.140]   Why should your work phase just be one monolith of 40 years?
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.140]   I've got this 40-year chunk
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.140]   and I'm going to do the same job
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.140]   continually throughout that.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.140]   That's how it used to be.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.140]   Nobody does that anymore.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.140]   But why not insert something different?
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.140]   Why not insert four different careers,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.140]   one for each decade of those 40 years,
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.140]   and enjoy the growth, the achievement,
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.140]   the success that can come with each of those things?
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.140]   Why not move from one specialty to another
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.140]   so that you're always learning and growing
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.140]   and moving along?
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.140]   Why not within each of those decades
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.140]   insert a couple different opportunities?
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.140]   Why not have two different jobs
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.140]   each for five years during each decade?
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.140]   Now you'll remember things much more clearly.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.140]   You'll have different unique circumstances.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.140]   You'll grow more in each opportunity.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.140]   Instead of just doing the same old thing,
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.140]   same old way, same people all the time,
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.140]   you'll have an opportunity to change and to adapt.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.140]   There may be good professional reasons
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.140]   not to bounce around all the time,
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.140]   just like there can be good professional reasons
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.140]   to bounce around more frequently than some people do.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.140]   But on a big picture,
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.140]   the phases of life matter,
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.140]   and they help us to engage with it.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.140]   What about where you live?
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.140]   What about how you work?
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.140]   What about things on a broader level?
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:32.140]   When I think back to something like my college experience,
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.140]   to me, one of the things that was the most impactful
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.140]   in my college experience
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.140]   was the one semester that I studied abroad.
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.140]   That phase of life,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.140]   one semester out of eight semesters,
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.140]   total of school,
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.140]   one semester,
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.140]   excuse me,
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.140]   that one out of eight semesters
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.140]   accounts for probably 50% of my college memories.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.140]   50% of the college memories come from the seven semesters,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.140]   and then 50% come from the one semester.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.140]   But why should it be that way?
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.140]   Why don't we do a more intentional job
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.140]   of creating change in our life
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.140]   so that we remember our life
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.140]   and so that we achieve different things
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.140]   at different phases of our life?
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.140]   And so in my own life,
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.140]   when I reflect back on the time prior to leaving the United States
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.140]   and the time after leaving the United States,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.140]   I experience a great joy in the challenges of life.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.140]   Part of that may simply have to do with the phase of life
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.140]   that I was in prior to leaving.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.140]   I was in, my wife and I, we got married,
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.140]   we had babies, we bought a house,
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.140]   we did all the stuff.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.140]   I had a stable job for a long time,
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.140]   then I started a business, et cetera.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.140]   And you reach that point,
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.140]   and it's not a midlife crisis,
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.140]   but it's one of those things
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.140]   where you've mastered a whole lot of aspects of your life
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.140]   and you're looking for something new,
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.140]   something different.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.140]   But you can't change everything all at the same time.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.140]   I'm not gonna get rid of my children
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.140]   just 'cause I want something new and different,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.140]   not gonna get rid of my wife
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.140]   just 'cause I want something new and different,
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.140]   not gonna get rid of a business
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.140]   just 'cause I want something new and different,
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.140]   not gonna get rid of my friends, my family, et cetera.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.140]   But is there something I can change?
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.140]   And so yeah, you can add a hobby,
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.140]   you can change houses,
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.140]   you can drive a different car.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.140]   What if you just change countries?
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.140]   What if you change the language that you live in?
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.140]   What if you change something like that?
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.140]   Those kinds of changes bring a zest to life,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.140]   and it's just simply flat out enjoyable.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.140]   And so when I left the United States,
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.140]   it was convenient to do so.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.140]   We had been traveling around the United States,
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.140]   living in an RV full time.
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.140]   We'd gotten rid of a lot of stuff.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.140]   We'd already just made life very streamlined.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.140]   And so once you do that for a while
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.140]   and you realize, hey,
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.140]   living out of some suitcases is not so bad,
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.140]   we can do it anyway,
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.140]   then we got a couple of passports,
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.140]   let's buy some plane tickets and hit the road.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.140]   It's a lot harder to make those enormous changes
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.140]   when you've got a lot of stuff.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.140]   You've got big house, lots of things, et cetera.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.140]   It's just much more challenging to make that change.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.140]   Now, I would hasten to add
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.140]   that you probably don't want to,
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.140]   for example, nomadism or traveling constantly,
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.140]   I don't think it's a great lifestyle.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.140]   I don't think it's a great long-term way to live.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.140]   Seems to work for some people,
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.140]   but it's not something that I'm interested in doing.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.140]   I don't want to live out of suitcase for 10 years.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.140]   I don't think it's a great way to raise children, et cetera.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.140]   There is a great value to the standard approach.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.140]   The standard approach,
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.140]   the conventional approach to life,
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.140]   contains a whole lot of wisdom
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.140]   that has been developed by our forebears
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.140]   and received from them
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.140]   in the form of a culture,
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.140]   in the form of a society.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.140]   This brings me conveniently to the next point,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.140]   that you don't appreciate what you have
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.140]   until you don't have it.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.140]   You don't appreciate your home
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.140]   and how comfortable it is
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.140]   until you're taken out of your home.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.140]   You often don't appreciate the people in your life
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.140]   until those people are absent.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.140]   We have the proverb
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.140]   that absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.140]   It does.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.140]   Because when you're taken away
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.140]   from the people that you love,
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.140]   you appreciate them more
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.140]   when you come back into context with them.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.140]   And for this reason,
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.140]   I think it's helpful
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.140]   to intentionally insert
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.140]   times of deprivation into our life
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.140]   or times of change.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.140]   We can do this in different ways.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.140]   We can fast in some way, shape, or form
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.140]   from food or certain forms of food.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.140]   Then when we reintroduce those forms of food to ourselves,
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   we appreciate them more deeply.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.140]   I see this myself very distinctly.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.140]   In four season weather cultures, climates,
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.140]   having grown up in Florida,
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.140]   where we don't have four seasons,
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.140]   we have two seasons.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.140]   One of the things that is so obvious to me
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.140]   is when I travel to a four season climate,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.140]   there is a much more intense experience of life
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.140]   based upon the seasonality.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.140]   When you go to a cold weather climate
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.140]   at higher latitudes,
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.140]   and it's summertime,
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.140]   there's this intense,
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.140]   joie de vivre,
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.140]   this intense pursuit of the good life
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.140]   that everybody seems to feel in the summer.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.140]   You know that winter is coming.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.140]   You know the cold, long, gray, rainy days are coming.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.140]   And so you get out there and you really enjoy it.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.140]   And people say yes to all kinds of things.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.140]   And there's summer festivals,
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.140]   and they go out at 10 o'clock at night,
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.140]   and they hang out,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.140]   and they do all the sports activities.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.140]   And someone says, "Do you want to go camping?"
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.140]   And you say, "Absolutely."
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.140]   Because you know the winter is coming.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.140]   On the other hand,
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.140]   when you're in a tropical climate,
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.140]   that doesn't exist.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.140]   Someone says, "Hey, you want to go hang out
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.140]   and go camping this weekend?"
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.140]   Well, maybe sometime.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.140]   There's a laziness.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.140]   There's just a lackadaisical attitude
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.140]   that exists much more intensely
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.140]   in tropical climates than in four-season climates.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.140]   And related to the climate,
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.140]   you have different activities.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.140]   And you can look forward with anticipation
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.140]   to those activities
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.140]   because they're not there all the time.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.140]   You have your summer activities,
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.140]   maybe you're outdoors,
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.140]   in the water,
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.140]   enjoying the long summer days.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.140]   You have your fall activities
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.140]   that you look forward to,
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.140]   the changes,
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.140]   the smells,
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.140]   the ways that you celebrate and live in fall.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.140]   Then you have your winter activities,
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.140]   your springtime,
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.140]   and your summer activities.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.140]   And being someone from a subtropical climate,
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.140]   to me, it's so obvious
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.140]   that that is a superior way
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.140]   to experience life.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.140]   That mixture of the familiar
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.140]   with the new and different.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.140]   Knowing that this season
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.140]   has its whole set of activities,
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.140]   its sports, its endeavors,
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.140]   its experiences,
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.140]   and I'm going to savor them
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.140]   for the three months that I have to savor them,
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.140]   and then they're going to be gone.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.140]   And I have to wait a whole year
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.140]   for them to get around.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.140]   But then there's a whole other series
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.140]   of activities to look forward to.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.140]   So why shouldn't we incorporate more of this
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.140]   into our life?
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.140]   And we can.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.140]   We do.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.140]   As people's wealth increases,
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.140]   sometimes they become snowbirds.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.140]   That was common where I'm from.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.140]   We have lots and lots of snowbirds
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.140]   live in the north during the summer,
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   usually springtime, summer, fall,
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   and then during the winter,
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.140]   they come to Florida.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.140]   What a great way to enjoy
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.140]   certain aspects of your life differently
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.140]   at different times.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.140]   Maybe you have your global relocation
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.140]   and you spend time in two or three homes
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.140]   around the world.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.140]   Why not incorporate more of that
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.140]   into our own lives?
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.140]   The careers that I've always admired
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.140]   have had this as well.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.140]   You have the concept of a sabbatical
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.140]   in the academic careers
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.140]   or for missionaries,
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.140]   people like that.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.140]   They have a time where after five, six, seven,
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.140]   eight years of work,
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.140]   then they take a year off
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.140]   or six months off
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.140]   and they go on leave
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.140]   and do something that's very different.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.140]   The experiences of that
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.140]   help to incorporate
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.140]   more of the seasonality of life.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.140]   And if you use that concept of sabbatical
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.140]   and incorporate it into your life,
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.140]   you go back to your other life
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.140]   a changed man.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.140]   And so basically,
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.140]   this was just this element
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.140]   of wanting a little bit of adventure,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.140]   wanting a little bit of a change.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.140]   That was one of the basic reasons
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.140]   why I left the United States
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.140]   was just to pursue that.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.140]   And this is why whenever I talk about this,
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.140]   I say I'm not upset at the United States.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.140]   I don't have, you know, I may go back.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.140]   But when I go back,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.140]   I go back with a,
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.140]   with a much bigger appreciation
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.140]   for the many good things of the country
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.140]   because absence makes the heart grow fond.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.140]   And to me, that's been really, really helpful.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.140]   So there's no denying that
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.140]   just a simple desire for adventure,
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.140]   simple desire for change,
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.140]   simple desire for variety,
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.140]   wanting to make interesting memories
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.140]   with my children in my own life,
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.140]   with my wife, etc.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.140]   is a big component of that.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.140]   And in a world that seems broadly conquered,
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.140]   where we don't struggle on a day-to-day basis,
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.140]   we flip on the tap
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.140]   and high-quality drinking water comes out,
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.140]   everything is provided for us.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.140]   We have money, we have warmth,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.140]   we have cool, we have food,
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.140]   we have relationships, etc.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   Sometimes you want to give up that
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.140]   for a new sense of adventure.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.140]   And international travel
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.140]   or international relocation
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.140]   is one way that that can be accomplished.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.140]   I should say,
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.140]   it's not only international,
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.140]   even just some kind of national level
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.140]   or local or regional level travel
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.140]   can be one way of incorporating that.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.140]   Now, I'll get to the opportunity comment
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.140]   in just a moment,
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.140]   but let me emphasize that
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.140]   there's one other aspect of seasonality
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.140]   that is really important.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.140]   And I've mentioned it already
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.140]   in terms of the stages of children.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.140]   When I left the United States,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.140]   I had a five-year-old,
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.140]   a three-year-old,
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.140]   and a one-year-old.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.140]   And one thing that is very clear to me
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.140]   is that as a parent,
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.140]   you have different levels of freedom
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.140]   and flexibility
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.140]   at different points in your life
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.140]   and your lifestyle.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.140]   When you have babies,
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.140]   they add hassle to your life.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.140]   Babies are a hassle,
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.140]   no question about it.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.140]   They add difficulty,
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.140]   they're annoying,
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.140]   they're loud.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.140]   They're a hassle.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.140]   They're not easy to bounce around
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.140]   all over the place with.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.140]   But babies very quickly,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.140]   become little children.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.140]   And little children are far less of a hassle
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.140]   than babies are.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.140]   Little children grow up
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.140]   to become adolescents.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   And the process of adolescence
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.140]   is a process that results in
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.140]   children having more and more
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.140]   of their own agendas in life.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.140]   And as a parent,
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.140]   we must respect
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.140]   the uniqueness of our children
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.140]   and treat them as persons.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.140]   Children are born as persons.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   And that personhood comes into
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.140]   greater and greater importance
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.140]   as they age.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.140]   When a child gets into the adolescent years,
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.140]   in many cultures,
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.140]   the adolescent years
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.140]   are the years of adulthood.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.140]   Then we have to incorporate our children
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   and their unique interests,
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.140]   their unique desires,
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140]   their unique goals,
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.140]   and their unique best lives
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.140]   into our family agenda.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.140]   But you don't really have to do that
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.140]   prior to adolescence.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.140]   I'm not saying that we will ever do anything
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.140]   that we don't genuinely think is good
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.140]   for our children.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.140]   But let's say that I decide
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.140]   that it's best for my family
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.140]   that we go on a road trip.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.140]   And one of my children starts complaining
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.140]   and says,
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   "I don't like road trips.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.140]   I don't want to go on a road trip.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.140]   I don't want to go in the car."
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.140]   Well, if that child is five years old,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.140]   I'm not going to go on a road trip.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.140]   I'm going to go on a road trip.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.140]   I'm going to go on a road trip.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.140]   I'm going to go on a road trip.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.140]   If you're five years old,
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.140]   I'm pretty much going to ignore that.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.140]   You're five years old.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.140]   You don't know what you should or should not like.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.140]   And I'm not that interested in your opinion.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.140]   So sit down, be happy,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.140]   and change your perspective.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.140]   That's a good lesson for a five-year-old.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.140]   On the other hand,
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.140]   if you're dealing with a 15-year-old
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.140]   and you say,
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.140]   "What we're really going to do
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.140]   is we're going to take a road trip
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.140]   and we're going to tour
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.140]   all of the Civil War battlefields."
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.140]   And your 15-year-old says,
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.140]   "I'm just not interested in any way,
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.140]   shape, or form.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.140]   in the Civil War battlefield.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.140]   Isn't there something different
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.140]   that we could do?"
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.140]   Then you want to incorporate
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.140]   with a great degree of care and love
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.140]   what your 15-year-old wants and desires
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.140]   and what's best for the 15-year-old.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.140]   You may still, obviously,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.140]   overrule his vote.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.140]   But you need to be very thoughtful
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.140]   about the personhood of that 15-year-old.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.140]   In addition, at five years old,
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.140]   it doesn't really matter
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.140]   what country your child is living in.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.140]   You can make some good reasons up
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.140]   why your child should learn another language
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.140]   or live in another place.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.140]   But at five years old,
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.140]   your child could be totally fluent
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.140]   in a foreign language
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.140]   and then you move to where
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.140]   that foreign language is not spoken at seven
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.140]   and the language will disappear.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.140]   So it really doesn't matter.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.140]   You can come and go as you like.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.140]   With a 15-year-old, though,
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.140]   if you just pluck your 15-year-old up
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.140]   out of a great school
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.140]   and he's on track
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.140]   and he's going to be a great teacher
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.140]   and he's on track for this certain thing
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.140]   that's really going to feed his career
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.140]   and he's got a great summer internship lined up, etc.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.140]   And you pluck him up and say,
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.140]   "No, we're going to go and live in the rainforest
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.140]   and study poison dart frogs,"
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.140]   then you have a different...
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.140]   that's going to be costly.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.140]   It's not to say it's not good.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.140]   Studying the poison dart frogs,
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.140]   living in the rainforest might be great.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.140]   But if he's not on board with that
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.140]   or that doesn't make sense
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.140]   given his life ambitions,
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.140]   you've got to be super careful about that.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.140]   And I see this so frequently among parents.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.140]   I see that parents ignore...
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.140]   They're so overwhelmed.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.140]   We are so overwhelmed sometimes
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.140]   with the challenges and the logistics of babies.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.140]   In a culture that makes baby raising very difficult,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.140]   it feels like a day-to-day battle.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.140]   And so what many parents do
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.140]   is they defer their dreams.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.140]   They defer their goals for their children
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.140]   until they're hoping that,
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.140]   "Well, someday my child will be mature enough
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.140]   to sit in a car for five hours."
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.140]   And they're dreaming and they're dreaming of that day.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.140]   And so they don't do it.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.140]   They don't travel.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   They don't go abroad.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.140]   They don't buy the camper.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.140]   They don't do the hard hikes, etc.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   And they're hoping that,
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.140]   "Someday my 13-year-old will finally be able
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.140]   to comb his own hair and brush his own teeth
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.140]   and finally be able to pick his room up, etc.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.140]   Then we'll start doing all the stuff."
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.140]   Well, then the 13-year-old doesn't want to do the stuff.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.140]   And now the chance is gone
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.140]   or it's a big challenge.
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.140]   Now, the 13-year-old is going to be a little bit more mature.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.140]   Now, this is not insuperable.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.140]   It can be overcome at any stage of life.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.140]   But my experience or my observation is
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.140]   that if you want children who are flexible,
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.140]   you kind of got to go do it.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.140]   And I'm not willing to defer
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.140]   the way that I want to live just for children.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.140]   So it certainly adds a whole lot of challenge.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.140]   It certainly adds a whole lot of stress.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.140]   It certainly adds a whole lot of expense.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.140]   But I'm not going to sit around
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.140]   and wait to live my life mission
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.140]   just because I happen to have a house full of children.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.140]   Rather, I'm going to incorporate my children in that mission.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.140]   I want to be sensitive to their needs.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.140]   I want to do the best thing possible.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.140]   But I want to do it at an early age.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.140]   And I want to do it when it's relatively easy.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.140]   There is a golden period
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:39.140]   when a child is, say, from, I don't know, 5 to maybe 13, 15,
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.140]   something like that.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.140]   There is a golden period of freedom from 5 to 13,
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.140]   from 6 to 14,
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.140]   where you don't have the difficulties of toddlers
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.140]   and really young children
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.140]   who are slaves to their emotions, etc.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.140]   But you don't yet have the difficulties of adolescents
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.140]   who are craving independence
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.140]   and craving to build their own lives.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.140]   And that's your golden period.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.140]   That golden period window closes very quickly.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.140]   And so for me, part of the reason to go
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.140]   and do the adventure and live abroad
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.140]   and move here, move there, etc.,
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.140]   just has to do with making sure that I do it while it's easy.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.140]   Because I now have a 10-year-old.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.140]   My window is closing very quickly.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.140]   That's not to say that I can't live my life the way that I want it to live,
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.140]   but I have to for the next, starting in a few years,
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.140]   for about 15 years,
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.140]   some of my own decisions have to be measured against
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.140]   the individual ambitions of my children.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.140]   And as a good father,
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.140]   I have to take their ambitions
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.140]   very carefully into account
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   and help them to achieve them.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.140]   And that may mean that I have to suppress
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.140]   and defer my own ambitions.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.140]   That can be a painful period of life.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.140]   That's the kind of thing that causes a lot of men to flip out.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.140]   But I think you can minimize that
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.140]   by not being one who sits around
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.140]   and worries about the difficulties of young children,
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.140]   but rather go and embrace the travel,
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.140]   embrace the stuff with young children,
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.140]   while also acknowledging
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.140]   that there are limitations associated with it.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.140]   Let me pivot now to the concept of opportunity.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.140]   Remember I said that I've always craved adventure
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.140]   and also opportunity.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:31.140]   I've been haunted by this question of opportunity.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.140]   And for many people it'll sound funny,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.140]   meaning that I come from the land of opportunity.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.140]   I come from the United States of America,
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.140]   known broadly as the land of opportunity.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.140]   In the past, I was unsure
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.140]   if it still is the land of opportunity,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.140]   if it was still deserving of that characterization.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.140]   And thus, I've wanted to travel and check it out,
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.140]   test and see.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:59.140]   I have a hard time believing stuff that's told to me.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.140]   I'm so conscious of the potential for bias
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.140]   based upon what we are shown
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.140]   or what information is selected to be presented to me.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.140]   I just have a hard time trusting what many people say
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:16.140]   unless I can interact with them enough
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:23.140]   to satisfy my own confidence
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.140]   in their bias or their lack of bias
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.140]   or how they overcome their biases.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.140]   So it's one thing if you just live in the United States
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.140]   and you accept because it was taught to you
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.140]   that America is the land of opportunity.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.140]   It's another thing if you've gone out looking for opportunity
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.140]   and you've either found it more in other places
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.140]   or you've then come back to the United States
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.140]   and discovered that it genuinely is the land of opportunity.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.140]   And so because of my interest in the world of internationalization
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.140]   and all the great newsletters and books and things
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.140]   that I have read over the years
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.140]   extolling the praises of this region or that region
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.140]   or this city or that city
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.140]   and because as Americans we're very good at
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.140]   seeing the worst in our country
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.140]   and thinking about how much better it used to be, etc.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.140]   I feel like I owe it to myself.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.140]   I feel like I owe it to my children to go out
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.140]   and check it out.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.140]   Let me go check it out.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.140]   See what the opportunity is in different places.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.140]   Go and see it for myself.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.140]   There's nothing in the world that can replace
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.140]   the power of a personal visit.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.140]   I don't care
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.140]   how learned you are.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.140]   I don't care how much you've learned about
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.140]   or how much you've seen.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.140]   There's just nothing that replaces the power
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:46.140]   of a personal visit.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.140]   Personal visit is more powerful
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.140]   when it's buttressed by good study, good examination,
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.140]   good data, etc.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.140]   But there's nothing that replaces the power
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.140]   of a personal visit.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.140]   And so as someone who cares a lot about optimizing,
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.140]   as someone who has strong feelings about the value
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.140]   of being in a good company and a good career
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   with a growth trajectory as being a fundamental factor
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.140]   that'll make the difference in your long-term financial outlook,
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.140]   I believe in going and looking for opportunity.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:17.140]   And this is a long-held thing.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.140]   I remember a book that impacted me very much
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.140]   when I was in high school was Jim Rogers' book.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.140]   I don't remember the name of it.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.140]   It was the one where he had his Mercedes convertible.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.140]   What Jim Rogers did, Jim Rogers was a wealthy investor.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.140]   He had made a lot of money in New York.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.140]   At one point in his life,
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.140]   he had gone around the world on a motorcycle.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.140]   And then he got married
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.140]   and he wanted to go around the world again.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:43.140]   And so he bought a Mercedes G-Wagon,
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.140]   which is a capable 4x4 vehicle.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.140]   He took off the body of the G-Wagon
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.140]   and replaced it with the body of a two-door convertible
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.140]   that Mercedes sold at that time.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.140]   And then he made a little trailer to go with it.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.140]   And he and his wife drove that thing around the world.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.140]   I was wandering through the library one day.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.140]   I found this book with this really intriguing picture
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.140]   on the front of this 4x4 convertible.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.140]   And I got the book from the library,
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.140]   took it home and read it in high school.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.140]   And I really just loved the idea of going around the world
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.140]   and looking for opportunity.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.140]   So that was kind of where the seed was planted.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.140]   But I didn't do much with that when I was younger.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.140]   One of the big opportunities that I frequently kicked myself for
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   that I didn't pursue was,
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.140]   during my senior year of college,
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.140]   when I studied abroad,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.140]   I met a guy who was a Chinese-Canadian.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.140]   And we met each other in Costa Rica.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.140]   And after Costa Rica, he was a pilot.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.140]   He became a pilot.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   And he went to Africa and got a job flying
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   for one of the twin-engine regional airplane services
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   in some corner of Africa.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   I don't know which.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.140]   And while he was there,
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.140]   he came across an opportunity
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.140]   to get involved with a company
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.140]   that was establishing cell phone infrastructure
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.140]   in that corner of Africa,
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.140]   working with a Chinese company
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.140]   to import cell phone infrastructure
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.140]   and to sell Chinese cell phones into Africa.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.140]   And he got in touch with me and he said,
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   "Joshua, you should come and get involved with this."
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.140]   Now, this was not completely out of my area of interest.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.140]   I was, my degree,
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.140]   my undergraduate degree is in international business.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.140]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.140]   I was always interested in international business.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.140]   But I didn't do it.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.140]   I was pursuing the safe path.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.140]   I had a job, had the stuff lined up,
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   and I viewed it as risky.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.140]   And after all, how could I go to Africa and do it?
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.140]   What if it fails?
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.140]   Nobody had yet put within me the concept of what if it works.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.140]   And nobody had told me about the need
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.140]   for asymmetrical opportunity
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.140]   and the need to go where there's less competition
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.140]   and get involved on the early ground floor.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.140]   And so I was working in a very traditional job
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.140]   and a very traditional business
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.140]   where there wasn't any big win opportunities.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.140]   But I thought that was the key.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.140]   I thought that the key was
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.140]   I need to make steady increases in my income.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.140]   I need to put aside 10% of my money for retirement.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.140]   I was locked in that mode of thinking.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.140]   Instead of the mode of thinking that I now would teach
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   to say that when you are young,
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.140]   the downside risk of any opportunity is very low.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.140]   As long as you can keep yourself alive,
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.140]   even bankruptcy risk is no big deal.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.140]   Go for it.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.140]   Go and look for an asymmetrical return.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   Go and look for something somewhere
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.140]   where you can get in on the ground floor,
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.140]   somewhere where you can take a risk,
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.140]   somewhere where you may do something big.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   And so I should have gone to Africa.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.140]   I would have figured out one there.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.140]   I would have had a lot less competition.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.140]   That's what I should have done.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.140]   And I didn't.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.140]   So that's okay.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.140]   We all make our decisions.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.140]   But that haunted me for a lot of years.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.140]   And then the lock-in.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.140]   I went from one job to another rather kind of safe,
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.140]   stable, boring job,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.140]   selling life insurance,
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.140]   doing financial planning,
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.140]   managing money.
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.140]   And then once you get into that world,
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.140]   it's like,
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.140]   I just got to do this.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.140]   I got to keep on going,
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.140]   got to keep on going.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.140]   But nothing's changed about that business in forever.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.140]   And so I always sensed that frustration of,
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.140]   where's the opportunity?
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.140]   Where's the thing that's going to be new and different?
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.140]   So when I started Radical Personal Finance,
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.140]   that was one of the first times in my life
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.140]   where I said yes to opportunity
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   because I believed in opportunity.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.140]   And nobody else believed in it.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.140]   Nobody except my dad and my dad, basically.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.140]   And he didn't believe in the opportunity.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.140]   He didn't know anything about it.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.140]   He just believed in me.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   And my wife believed in me.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.140]   And that was it.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.140]   Every other person that I asked for advice
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.140]   told me I shouldn't do it.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.140]   Every other person said I was a fool
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.140]   for doing what I wanted to do.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.140]   Well, I did it.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.140]   And I'm very glad I did it
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.140]   because I saw opportunity based on timing.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   And it worked.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.140]   And it gave me a dream life.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.140]   And I'm very grateful for that.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.140]   And so over the years,
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.140]   I've tried to train myself
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.140]   to walk away from conservative thinking,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.140]   to walk away from the safe route,
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.140]   and go for opportunity.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.140]   And every time I've said no to conservatism
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.140]   and said yes to opportunity,
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.140]   I have enjoyed the journey immensely.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.140]   Hasn't always been winners,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   but it's just been more enjoyable,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.140]   a better life, more interesting.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.140]   And even in failure,
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   it's more interesting.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.140]   And I wouldn't trade the failure
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.140]   for success in the other.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.140]   So how much is this personality?
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.140]   You be the judge.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.140]   But I want the same opportunity
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.140]   for myself in the future
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.140]   and for my children.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.140]   I want the same thing.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.140]   And sometimes a relocation
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.140]   would be a great way of achieving that.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.140]   And even if it's a temporary relocation,
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.140]   it's still incredibly valuable
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.140]   because it speeds up the process of learning.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   And in an international context,
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.140]   it's still incredibly valuable
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.140]   because it speeds up the process of learning.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.140]   And in an international context,
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.140]   it speeds up the process of learning
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.140]   in a way that probably nothing else can.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.140]   Years or so ago,
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.140]   I was in a Springs in Florida with my family.
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.140]   And there I met a young man
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.140]   who had just graduated from business school
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.140]   at a local university there in Florida.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.140]   And he was thinking about his decisions after college.
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.140]   He had a couple of job offers and whatnot.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.140]   But in talking to him,
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.140]   he said,
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.140]   And I said,
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.140]   And he said,
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.140]   And I said,
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.140]   And he said,
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.140]   And I said,
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.140]   And he said,
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.140]   And I said,
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.140]   And he said,
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.140]   And I said,
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.140]   And he said,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.140]   And I said,
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.140]   And he said,
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.140]   And I said,
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.140]   And he said,
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.140]   And I said,
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.140]   And he said,
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.140]   And I said,
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.140]   And he said,
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.140]   And I said,
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.140]   And he said,
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.140]   And I said,
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.140]   And he said,
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.140]   And I said,
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.140]   And he said,
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.140]   And I said,
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.140]   And he said,
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.140]   And I said,
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.140]   And he said,
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.140]   And I said,
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.140]   And he said,
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.140]   And I said,
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.140]   And he said,
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.140]   And he said,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.140]   And I said,
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.140]   And he said,
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.140]   And I said,
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."

[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.140]   And I said,

[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.140]   And he said,

[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.140]   And I said,

[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.140]   And he said,
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.140]   And I said,
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.140]   And he said,
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.140]   And he said,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.140]   And I said,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.140]   And he said,

[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.140]   And I said,

[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.140]   And he said,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.140]   And I said,
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   And he said,
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.140]   And I said,
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.140]   And he said,
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.140]   And I said,
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.140]   And he said,
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.140]   And I said,
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   And he said,
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.140]   And I said,
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.140]   And he said,
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.140]   And I said,
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.140]   And he said,
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.140]   And I said,
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   And he said,
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.140]   And I said,
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   And he said,
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.140]   And I said,
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.140]   And he said,
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.140]   And I said,
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.140]   And he said,
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   And I said,
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.140]   And he said,
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.140]   And I said,
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.140]   And he said,
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.140]   And I said,
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140]   And he said,
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140]   "I'm going to be a business school teacher."
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:16.180]   And while it can be false to expect that that is always more abundant in an international
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.180]   context, it's been fun to go and search for it.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.300]   It's been fun to go and look for it.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.700]   And I have learned an enormous amount.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.720]   In five years of being abroad, I feel like I've packed in 15 years of living.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.940]   That's a pretty good ratio because we don't actually have that much time in the earth.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.140]   Sometimes I feel like some people I know,
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.780]   they'll pack in about a year worth of living into five years.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.760]   And their ratio is really, really low.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.720]   And they'll get through a 50-year career and have about five meaningful years or 10 meaningful
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.140]   years of living packed into that.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:56.320]   And the rest of the time was sat swiping on a screen.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.800]   My experience over the last five years, I feel like I've packed in about 15 years into
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.080]   five years.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   And that has been great.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.860]   I don't know if I would have accomplished that if I didn't start the process of moving
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.860]   a little bit,
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.180]   looking for some different things.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.980]   It's not been perfect.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.120]   There's been a lot of costs to it.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.520]   Things that I now understand that I didn't before.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.040]   But in terms of feeling a sense of confidence in myself for making decisions to go for the
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.860]   things that I'm interested in, for making decisions to say yes to the things that I
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.800]   want to pursue, that's been great.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.580]   And then when I reflect on the experiences,
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:48.480]   of, as I said, the last five years, it does feel like a really great return on investment
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:42:00.980]   in terms of the amount of life and life experiences for me and for my children, for my wife, etc.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.900]   If you have an interest in adventure or you're looking for opportunity, don't be scared to
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.900]   pursue it.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.900]   It's not how you go for it.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.620]   But don't be scared to pursue it.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:15.180]   Not everybody seems to be wired this way, but I myself fear the failed.
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:26.140]   I fear regret of circumstances not pursued much more than I fear failure of circumstances
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.140]   pursued.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.980]   And if that resonates with you in any way, then you're probably the kind of person who
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.520]   should say yes to adventure.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   Yes to opportunity.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.900]   And whatever way appeals to you personally.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.900]   I'm not going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:37.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:41.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   I'm going to go into too much detail on that.
