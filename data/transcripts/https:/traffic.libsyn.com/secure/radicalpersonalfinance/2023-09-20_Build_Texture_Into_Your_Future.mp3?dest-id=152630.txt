[00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.560]   Guess what's back?
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:19.900]   Let's see if I still have my timing.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.740]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.020]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.280]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.560]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.520]   I am your host.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.880]   And on today's podcast, I guess I'll tell you the story of what happened to the music.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.300]   And I'll also tell you about the importance of phases and stages in life.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:52.640]   I was recently shamed by a listener.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.920]   That's not right.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.020]   The listener said, Joshua, I really miss the music.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.060]   And I made another effort after a long saga.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.240]   I went with the missing music to go and find the file.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.640]   The reality of why the music has been away for a while.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.580]   And for new listeners who may not know, this is the song that I used to introduce
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.060]   probably 600 episodes of Radical Personal Finance, something like that.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.820]   And what happened was that over the years, I had bought this piece of music.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.340]   And I had several backup files from when I first bought it.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.400]   And I would put it on my devices and use it as kind of the intro music, etc.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760]   And then at one point in time,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.640]   I had swapped out various devices and I had wiped the card and I went to go put it back
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.380]   on the device and it disappeared from a computer.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.580]   To this day, I don't know how it disappeared because I had so many copies of it.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.060]   I had it stored in various formats.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.500]   It's a mystery to me of where it disappeared to.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.140]   But I searched and searched, couldn't find it.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.940]   So I said, no problem.
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.320]   I'll just go and get it off of my backup hard drive.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.740]   Well, lo and behold, my backup hard drive was inaccessible to me because I made myself
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.280]   a beautiful, enormous, fancy password that then...
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.560]   Then I forgot.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.760]   And I didn't write it down.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.320]   Stupid security issues and whatnot.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080]   So I lost access to that hard drive.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.160]   And of course, it was quintuple encrypted and inaccessible, etc.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.740]   So no problem.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.260]   I'll just get it off of another hard drive.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.200]   Well, the problem is all the other backup hard drives were in another country.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.740]   So I don't even have them.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.460]   So I just didn't have it, didn't have it.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.300]   And I thought, well, I'll just go to the website where I got it originally, which is danosongs.com.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.240]   But Dano, of course, has every song on the website.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.980]   Except for my song.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.480]   So I wrote to him and I said, can I have a copy of it?
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.360]   Didn't hear back.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.480]   And no problem.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.960]   Well, fine.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.700]   I just couldn't...
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.240]   Didn't find it.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.800]   Well, anyway, after the listener saying that I really like the song and I miss it, I made
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.280]   another effort and I have found the song again.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.720]   I don't have a high fidelity version of it, unfortunately.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.260]   So it's a little bit muddy and not quite as crisp as the original beautiful Dano songs
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.320]   version, but that's okay.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.680]   I'm glad to have it back.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.640]   And I will play it.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.920]   I'll play it from time to time.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.840]   Part of the reason I stopped playing it was just out of a desire to get to the point.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.820]   I think with any kind of audio or any kind of video, et cetera, you need to get to the
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.000]   point.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.360]   You have a little bit more time with a podcast, especially a long running podcast, but still
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.100]   got to get to the point.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.380]   And so having a less than 10 second intro is a good way of getting to the point.
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.180]   And even if I do an ad or something at the beginning, I generally within 45 to 60 seconds,
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.780]   I'm right into the meat of the content.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.500]   And in line with that, let's move into the point of today's show.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.660]   On today's podcast, I want to talk to you about the phases of life.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.740]   And I'm going to do this in the context of talking about it with regard to marriage.
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.500]   But this is something that's applicable to those who are married, who have children and
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.840]   those who do not and are not.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.160]   Because this is something that is a lot easier for married people with children to look forward
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.840]   to, but it is something that is vital for the unmarried to also integrate into their
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.640]   life.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.320]   And so I want to share with you why I'm talking about this first.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.640]   As I introduced in a podcast last week, I want to talk about marriage because marriage
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.600]   is core to finance.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.660]   I want to tackle a whole slew of financial related questions and issues related to marriage,
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.780]   how to get a great deal on an engagement ring and how much money you should spend on it,
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.400]   how you should spend on a wedding, et cetera.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.620]   But when you think about the topic of marriage, what you will see is that in the first place,
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:37.060]   it is intertwined in probably not 80% of financial decisions, certainly more than 50% of financial
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.600]   decisions.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:46.320]   I'm going to estimate 67.34% of financial decisions involve marriage in some way.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.980]   Just go through something like the CFP curriculum and what you will see is that so many decisions
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.760]   are impacted primarily based upon marriage.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.600]   For example, how long of an engagement?
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840]   How big of an emergency fund does a married couple need?
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.080]   Well, generally three months if both spouses are working versus a single person, generally
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.800]   six months.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.540]   What tax benefits do we have and what tax rules?
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.100]   Well, there's a whole set of tax rules for married couples filing jointly and they're
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.420]   different than single couples.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.140]   What about insurance planning?
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.540]   Well, if you're married and have children, you probably need to get life insurance.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.980]   If you're single, you probably don't.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.580]   If you need disability income insurance, well, if you're married, you probably need to get
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.640]   it.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.480]   You probably should have it, but it's not as fundamental as if you're single and you're
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.580]   all on your own.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.880]   What about estate planning?
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.280]   Well, if you're married, you have a whole path you're going to go down and a whole set
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.060]   of goals that you're going to pursue that you're not going to pursue if you're single.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.520]   What about children?
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.120]   A huge portion of financial planning is focused around providing for children in every way,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.820]   shape, and form.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.940]   And so the decision to marry is fundamental to financial planning, but it goes even more
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.400]   than that.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.640]   The decision to marry and have children is fundamental to money, to how much money you
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.920]   make.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   We know that married people earn more than unmarried people, to how much money you keep.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.180]   We know that married people not only are richer on average than unmarried people, but
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.820]   even married couples of the same age as cohabitating couples tend to have, I think it's three to
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.580]   four times as much net worth, three to four times higher net worth of a married couple
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.540]   rather than a cohabitating couple.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.420]   And so these decisions are fundamental, but they're also fundamental at the things that
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.740]   people are most scared about.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.700]   The divorce and losing half your money in a divorce and everything associated with that
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.640]   is a huge deal.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.880]   And so I'm very concerned because not only do we need good guidance on these issues,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.500]   but I see a present catastrophe in human relationships.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.520]   Those of us who have been able to figure out how to develop and maintain a relationship
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.740]   and maintain a healthy, normal relationship, I think we consider ourselves to be fairly
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.260]   lucky and grateful for that.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.280]   Just last night, my wife was telling me about close friends of hers growing up, seemingly
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.040]   wonderful couples just flipped on social media and found out that they were divorced and
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.600]   divorcing.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.580]   Divorced, I guess.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.440]   It's been a while now.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.740]   She goes on social media once a year.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.240]   So the point is, and it's not only, by the way, let me just go one more minute on this.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.500]   It's not only, by the way, let me just go one more minute on this.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.940]   It's not only divorce and various issues associated with that, but it goes so much
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.240]   deeper.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.300]   Right now, we're in a crisis of relationship formation.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.880]   We're in a genuine crisis of relationship formation among young men and women, to say
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.580]   nothing at all of marriage, to say nothing at all of children.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.200]   We are in a crisis of relationship formation.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.280]   And it is a deep, deep burden.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.580]   It is a deep burden on our young people.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.540]   And it is something that we have to step in and we have to fix.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:12.140]   We, you and I, must be leaders in our society to discuss these issues, to identify potential
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.700]   solutions to these issues, and then to bring in those solutions to those issues and give
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.560]   guidance and counsel to our younger generation so that our younger generation is able to
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.960]   form successful relationships.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:47.300]   And so I feel a great burden to talk about these subjects, most focusedly in the manner
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.860]   in which they connect with financial planning.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.900]   So that's why I'm doing this series.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.860]   But I haven't known where to start over the last couple of weeks, just thinking, okay,
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.440]   where do I start?
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.160]   What's the first show?
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.900]   And so the mic's been silent because I didn't know where to start.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.140]   So today, I decided just to start in the middle.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.760]   It's always where you start when you don't know where to start.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.740]   It's just start in the middle.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.460]   And then go back and fill in the beginning and fill in the end.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.300]   And the middle that I have chosen to start with has to do with this.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:19.160]   I want to give one among many benefits and one among many reasons for people to consider
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.620]   being married and having children.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.360]   And that is simply this.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.420]   When you look forward in your life...
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.420]   And you look back on your life...
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:46.400]   Your children will give you a wonderful set of automatic goals, benchmarks, and milestones
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.000]   that will break up the monotony of your life.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.100]   I have a personal theory and a personal goal.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.400]   My personal goal is that I want to remember...
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.420]   My life.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.520]   And I want all those that I love to remember their lives.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.380]   And I want to be a catalyst in building those memories.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:14.220]   My theory about memory is that memory is enhanced by emotion and variety.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.540]   If we do the same thing again and again and again and again, and there's little to no
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:27.380]   variety in the event, and there's little to no emotion in the event, then all of the events
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:34.140]   of that day or that week or that month or that year will be over time systematically forgotten.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:42.260]   And so we want to incorporate as much emotion and as much variety into our lives as is possible.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.940]   This is good for our brains.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.800]   We should...
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.060]   If we always brush your teeth with your right hand, regularly you should switch to your
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.640]   left hand.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.500]   If you always go the same route to work, sometimes you should take a different route.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.360]   We want to incorporate variety into our lives on a daily basis.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.900]   We also want to incorporate this intentionally into the big events of life.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.700]   We want to think about the big events and how we can make them peak experiences.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.840]   And so I want to be a catalyst for this in my own life and in the lives of those that
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.580]   I love, bringing in variety.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.240]   And again, this can be done just by doing something out of the ordinary.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.740]   If you always go to your parents' house for dinner on Tuesday evening, then go on Tuesday
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.500]   evening, but this time bring your mom an enormous bouquet of flowers.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.140]   Or if you always go to an Italian restaurant,
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:33.000]   on the weekends, then go to a restaurant where you sit on the floor and eat with your
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.720]   hands or eat your sandwiches on a boat.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.320]   You know, just anything you can do will help to remember things.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.220]   At the end of our life, our memories, both in our minds as well as our memories that
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.100]   are encapsulated in the bodies and the experiences of others that we have impacted in our lives
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.000]   is basically what we are going to have.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.420]   That's it.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.300]   Everything else is dust and to dust it returns.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.740]   So in order to do this, in order to build a life of satisfaction, we want to incorporate
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.300]   variety into our life.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:15.840]   Now that variety and change is something that we can and should plan for in advance.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.160]   And we can do this in every aspect of our life.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.120]   We can do this in our physical form.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.200]   We can do this in our sport life.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.640]   We can do this in our relationships.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.060]   We can do this in our business.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:34.340]   One of my favorite things personally about being an entrepreneur is that I have control
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.520]   over how I spend my time and I don't have to make big decisions.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.640]   I've always been inspired by the idea that if I change 10% of my life per year, 10% of
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.760]   my work life, 10% of my business per year, then over the course of a decade, I'll wind
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.780]   up living an entirely new and different life.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.980]   I'll wind up with an entirely new and different business.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.280]   This has been meaningful.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.380]   This has been meaningful to me as I reflect back on a decade of radical personal finance
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.820]   and the work that I have done.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:08.560]   And I am continuing to do radical personal finance, but it's not been my 100% focus along
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:08.860]   the way.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.240]   I've had other things that I've worked on and that has led to a different life today
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.840]   than I had 10 years ago, which I'm very grateful for.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.160]   So we can do this in business.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.200]   We can do this in money.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:25.620]   We can think about those stages of life and what our milestones and our benchmarks are
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.500]   along the way.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:37.600]   But what's very difficult is what to do when you are a single man or a single woman or
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:48.660]   even a married couple without children and you have been highly successful at life and
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.640]   you no longer have to do anything.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.440]   What do you do when you reach that point?
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.240]   What do you do when you retire at 35?
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.980]   What do you do when you retire at 35 with millions and millions of dollars in the bank
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.380]   and no need to make more money?
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:09.920]   When you look forward and life has very little texture to it.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.600]   Now, if that is you, I want to coach you.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.760]   I want to tell you that you can insert texture into your life and you should so do.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.360]   You should think about, okay, I'm 35 years old.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.120]   I may have six decades.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.520]   I may have six decades remaining.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.840]   So with those six decades, I need to make a plan for decade number one, decade number
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.100]   two, decade number three, decade number four, decade number five, and decade number six.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.920]   It's wonderful that I've achieved this success at an early age, but I can't just have a sea
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.560]   of sameness out in my future.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.520]   Otherwise, I don't have anything to pull me forward into the future.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:51.500]   One of the maxims that I live by is that your future must always be bigger than your past.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.500]   Your future must always be bigger than your past.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.040]   It needs to be bigger and more exciting.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.200]   And so you have to insert.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.820]   You have to insert variety and texture, and you can do that in your activities, in your
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.980]   business life, et cetera.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.500]   But here's what's cool.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.380]   What about the rest of us who may not be so accomplished?
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:22.940]   Being a parent is something that automatically gives you texture and variety to your life.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.960]   And well, that's not the only benefit.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:27.240]   It's not the only benefit.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   It's not the only benefit.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.260]   It's not the only benefit.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.160]   It's not the only benefit of having children.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.100]   When I think about it, it's an enormous benefit.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:39.220]   It is fundamental to the experience of humanity, to desire to have children, and then to enjoy
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.420]   the different stages of your life as associated with those children.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:53.160]   And if you don't have that, you miss out on a whole kind of automatic set of goals and
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.060]   of potential satisfaction.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.120]   Also, the risk for trial and trial.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.580]   Trauma and difficulty and frustration.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.360]   But a whole set of goals and a whole set of things that you can look forward to.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:11.480]   What's so interesting to me is that ideally these two things can and should go together.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.980]   I don't think that you have to choose in life one or the other.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.100]   That's a false choice.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.620]   Either I'm going to be really great at business or I'm going to get married and have children.
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:26.560]   But what we're finding is that many of our fellow citizens,
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:35.040]   are making a choice to choose one or the other, or to deal with things in a linear format.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:43.080]   And so one of the big fundamental problems that we're facing in the population problems,
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.220]   potential crisis, I try to be careful with that word crisis, but I do think it's apt here,
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:54.580]   in population, is that people are not having enough children to sustain and grow our cultures.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.840]   And one of the things that we're finding is that people are not having enough children to sustain and grow our cultures.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:55.900]   And one of the things that we're finding is that people are not having enough children to sustain and grow our cultures.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:55.940]   And one of the things that we're finding is that people are not having enough children to sustain and grow our cultures.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.000]   And one of the things that we're finding is that people are not having enough children to sustain and grow our cultures.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.020]   And one of the things that we're finding is that people are not having enough children to sustain and grow our cultures.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:06.520]   And one reason that they're not having children is that we have made life decisions linear.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:17.660]   With the separation of natural sexual urges from marriage, that separation enabled by contraception,
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:23.420]   with that separation, we have made family formation optional.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.000]   And due to its optionality, we have made family formation optional.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:55.980]   And due to its optionality, we have made family formation optional.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.820]   And so people are often financially successful, have great jobs, great careers, etc.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.120]   And yet then they're not able to form families for a variety of reasons.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.640]   And they're not able to enjoy that other aspect of life.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:22.260]   Now, from time immemorial, human beings, due to their natural urge to be with the one that they love and to procreate,
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260]   throughout history, human beings have...
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.140]   have borne these things forward at the same time.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:36.740]   They have had children and moved into a starter house and enjoyed the stages of life of moving up.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:48.780]   But our modern society has stripped away so many of those pleasures in favor of money, money, money, money, more money, more money, more career success, more career success.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:54.780]   And it doesn't seem to me that we have done a very good job of...
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:04.920]   of showing the vague emptiness that occurs if you don't bear these things forward together.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:13.340]   This is why married people and people who have children have an enormous advantage.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.760]   Because they can look forward.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:24.560]   And there's always something to look forward to due to simply natural family formation and natural reproductive cycles.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.620]   I myself keep a chart.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.980]   I look at it every day.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.620]   And in that chart, I lay out the decades of my life.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.040]   This is something that I didn't used to do.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.640]   I started doing it a number of years ago, though.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.640]   And it's been something that's been really helpful to me.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.560]   And it's part of my really big focus on trying to say, how do I make my future bigger than my past?
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.080]   And it started with kind of the next few years, which I could see and what I want to accomplish in the next few years.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.260]   But as my wife and I got out of baby mode, where we're just dealing with little babies all the time,
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.540]   and we started to deal with actual human beings that we can interact with and relate with in some way,
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.100]   then I started to be very, very conscious of the time-bound nature of things.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.040]   And so I started laying out my charts.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.560]   And so on my charts, I show the decade of my life.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.580]   I have the ages of my children at certain times.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:14.060]   And what is really cool about that is as I look forward into the future on those goal-setting charts,
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:21.580]   on that timeline, on that visioning that I do, there's never not something to look forward to.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.200]   There's always a change.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.980]   My wife and I can look back on baby mode and say, that was what babies were like.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.480]   But then we can look forward to high school graduation, teenagers.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.360]   What is it going to be like?
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:42.580]   How exciting is it going to be to interact with our teenage children when they're somewhat responsible and yet still need us?
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:48.400]   And then, again, the series of graduations and excitement of people getting their jobs and building their careers
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.580]   and getting married and grandchildren and grandchildren's graduation and great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.900]   You look forward through the decades and you imagine what it's like.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.280]   And it brings this incredible joy to thinking about the future.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:10.060]   And that joy runs alongside all of the other joys of business success and world domination
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.680]   that ideally will be a part of your and my future.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.720]   But they don't have to be in conflict.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.340]   They do affect one another, but they don't have to be in conflict.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.300]   You don't have to choose.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.360]   You can have them both.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.380]   I want to speak carefully but candidly.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:36.460]   I feel a great sympathy for people who don't have a full experience of life.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:43.120]   And I believe that if you narrow your ambitions exclusively to the financial,
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   it will seem to you in the shortness of time that you have won
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.440]   because your lifestyle will be the same.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:52.660]   Your lifestyle will be the same.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.760]   Your lifestyle will be easier.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.700]   You will have more time to work.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.560]   You'll probably make more money in the short term.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.960]   You can have full control over that money.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.580]   You don't have to interact with anybody, etc.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.340]   You can just decide what you want to do.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:15.400]   But if you pull it back and you look over the course of your entire lifetime,
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   you will want...
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.880]   All of those non-financial things as well.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:31.120]   But you have to make your decisions early.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   That's what's so hard about it.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.960]   Maybe you don't have to make them as early as you once did.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.180]   I was...
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.260]   A couple of years ago, I was at a conference and I heard Tony Robbins speak.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:45.320]   And he shared that he and his third, second wife, third wife, second...
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:45.580]   I don't know.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.480]   He and his wife, Sage, had just welcomed a baby.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.800]   And I looked it up and I think he was 60 years old.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.740]   61 years old.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.100]   And so here he was.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.140]   He already has three adopted children, one biological.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.380]   So this was his fifth child.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.240]   But here he was at 61 years old, starting over again with a baby.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.400]   And more power to him.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.900]   I get concerned with the morality of surrogacy and whatnot.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.680]   But a friend, okay, fine.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.780]   Wonderful that they can do that.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.500]   And I thought, isn't it incredible to be...
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.440]   Wouldn't it be incredible to be 60 years old and have all of the...
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.700]   All of the resources, all of the everything, and be able to go through that again?
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.540]   I've watched that a lot with friends and people who have gotten divorced
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.240]   and then formed a new family and started over again.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.000]   That they go through the experience in a different way.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.020]   I think that's not the ideal.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.480]   The ideal is that you should enjoy that at a certain point in your life
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.940]   and then enjoy that with your grandchildren.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.380]   That's the proper way.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.040]   There's something a little strange when we go the other directions.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.820]   But the point is that we can see that it adds texture
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.220]   and variety to life.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.480]   And you want that texture and variety in your life.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.420]   You want that joy.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.020]   You want those Christmases surrounded by your grandchildren
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.260]   and your great-grandchildren.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.540]   You want more of that in your life.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.340]   And it makes life planning and life anticipation
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.840]   simpler and more straightforward.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.740]   I've been on something of a biography spree
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.620]   over this past couple of years.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.680]   And I want to encourage you to read some biographies
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.620]   and consider the lives and lifestyles that you have.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:20.640]   And I want to encourage you to read some biographies
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:20.800]   and consider the lives and lifestyles that you have.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:20.820]   And I want to encourage you to read some biographies
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:20.840]   and consider the lifestyles that you have.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.520]   of people who have gone before you.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.300]   Because a biography, especially about someone who's dead and gone,
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.260]   is a really neat way for you to test your own thinking.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.360]   But a couple of years ago, I read the biography of Steve Jobs
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.860]   and the Isaacson biography.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.120]   And it really impacted me because I thought
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.460]   he did a great job of bringing out the variety of experience
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.080]   that Jobs had and kind of who he was, et cetera.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.220]   But here was this guy who was completely brilliant.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.620]   And yet, he was a great guy.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.920]   And yet, you reflect on his life,
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.400]   and it seemed like with all of his brilliance
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:03.180]   and all of his financial creation,
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.940]   the incredible companies that he began,
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.280]   all of his accomplishments, et cetera,
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.820]   wouldn't it have been so much more fulfilling
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:18.080]   if he were surrounded by his children and his grandchildren
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.600]   instead of the very empty,
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.760]   personal life that he wound up having?
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:29.500]   And you compare a biography of him to,
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.680]   what name should I cite?
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.060]   Maybe Rich DeVos?
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.440]   Rich DeVos, the founder of Amway,
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.860]   I was super interested.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.120]   Last year, I found some reports of,
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.980]   I found Rich DeVos' one of his grandsons
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.880]   who had spent a year basically traveling around the world
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.320]   on a boat with some of his buddies.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.380]   And I was fascinated to hear his stories and whatnot.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.800]   And I imagined, I don't remember when this was,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.680]   I think it was when his grandfather was still alive,
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.620]   but I imagined the joy that that grandfather felt
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.400]   of seeing his young grandson go off around the world
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.580]   on a global expedition.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.040]   And I thought, how much more satisfying is it
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.660]   to be a billionaire and see those that you love
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.940]   while you're alive able to enjoy the fruits of your labor?
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.740]   Isn't that more satisfying than just having the money yourself?
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.040]   I want to be cautious because you have the right to respect,
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.340]   to make your own choices,
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.780]   but I want to urge you to think about it very, very carefully.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.940]   I have a hard time understanding
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:41.960]   how people who don't have this kind of built-in set of goals in life
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.100]   that just is so fundamental to what it means to be human,
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.000]   how you ultimately find satisfaction
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.220]   unless you create it for yourself,
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.080]   in a way that I'll get to in just a moment.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.140]   I think of an example like Alex Hormozy, right?
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.380]   I'm a big admirer of Alex Hormozy.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.760]   He's incredibly smart, incredibly hardworking, very successful.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.760]   And yet he and his wife Layla, and he and his wife Layla,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.540]   have built an enormous empire with their business
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.680]   and they're only getting started.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.640]   I mean, his goal is to be the most jacked billionaire of all time
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.180]   and there's not a doubt in my mind that he will achieve it.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.260]   And yet from the very beginning,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.260]   the only point that he has to any of it
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.840]   is to just play the game.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.480]   That the goal, the point is to play the game.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.800]   That's admirable,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.000]   but it rings very hollow to me.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.120]   I've never spoken with Alex.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.220]   I'm sure he's thought carefully about the life decisions
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.600]   that he has made thus far.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.080]   And he's very young.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.940]   There's still time for him to do whatever he wants to do.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.540]   But think about someone like him as an example.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.940]   Imagine yourself in that position.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.880]   Imagine yourself that you're 30 years old.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.840]   You've made tens of millions of dollars.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.480]   You're completely financially independent.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.240]   You've married love of your life, a beautiful woman
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.020]   that you're partnered side by side in creating a business empire.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.840]   Now imagine the decades.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.620]   30 to 40.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.440]   40 to 50.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.120]   50 to 60.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.760]   60 to 70.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.300]   70 to 80.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.880]   80 to 90.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.300]   90 to 100.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.240]   You can go on if you want.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.500]   Imagine those decades passing.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.460]   How are you going to structure your decades?
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.040]   What is going to be your theme to the decades
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.340]   so that you will remember it?
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.500]   How are you going to build and suck the juice out of life
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.960]   so that you live a life that fills your mind with rich memories
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.840]   and all those around you?
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.580]   You're going to have to build it in artificially
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.500]   if you don't have the natural ability
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.060]   and the natural growth of your family.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.040]   So let's talk about how you do that.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.620]   And by the way, even if you do have a family,
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.560]   think about this because I think that, again,
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.000]   you don't have to choose one of these.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.340]   My hope is that in the fullness of time I can do both.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.680]   You are definitely limited in your ability
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.360]   when you have young children.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.540]   You are limited in your ability to do the other things.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.980]   But there's plenty of time.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.800]   For most of us, life is very long.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.560]   What do you do?
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.320]   You need to expand.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.440]   You need to expand your goal setting and your vision
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.500]   beyond dollars on a page.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.780]   I will at some point do a separate podcast on,
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.760]   but I'll give you the two-minute version of it here.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.620]   Money is the most easily measured metric.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   That's why we love to measure it.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.920]   But it is one of the least rewarding metrics.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.140]   It should not be a primary metric
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.400]   of success.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.060]   It's only a primary metric of success
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.740]   because it is easily measured.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.520]   But the analogy that I would draw
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.280]   is that your weight is also easily measured
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.560]   and your weight is informative.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.040]   A physician can know your weight
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.180]   and have some sense of the meaning of those numbers.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.960]   But without all of the other metrics,
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.640]   using my analogy,
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.380]   whether you're male or female,
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.700]   how tall you are,
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.320]   how much muscle you have,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.800]   et cetera,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.740]   it's hard to draw any adequate conclusions
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.300]   about the meaning of your weight.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.600]   You need a whole lot of texture.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.300]   And it's the same thing with money.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.020]   Money is a useful metric,
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.400]   but it's only useful
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.740]   when it comes in the midst
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.440]   of all of the other metrics
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.920]   that lead to life satisfaction.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.780]   And those other metrics are the ones that are useful.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.100]   And those other metrics are not so easily measured.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.220]   Some of them are.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.420]   Number of years married,
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.920]   personal sense of happiness and contentment in your life,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.580]   satisfaction that you have with your spouse,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.780]   number of children you have,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.960]   number of grandchildren, great-grandchildren, et cetera.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.860]   There are other numbers that can be measured,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.820]   but it's only in the fullness of analysis
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.600]   that money is a useful metric.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   So be careful only measuring money
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.020]   without those other things.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.660]   To somebody who has the full perspective,
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.420]   just like a physician who has the full perspective,
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.600]   you're standing in front of him,
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.660]   he can see how tall you are,
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.460]   he can see how much muscle you have, et cetera,
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.980]   well then weight is a useful metric.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.840]   But then there's all those other metrics
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.160]   that need to be brought in as well.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.400]   But it's not the metric of success.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.360]   The same with money.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.460]   Money's primary benefit
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.420]   is that it's easy to measure.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.280]   Easily measured.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.340]   But because of the fact that it's easy to measure,
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.360]   it often takes on a wrong size.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.200]   It takes on a wrong sense of proportion.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.500]   People value it too much to the exclusion of other things.
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.620]   So back to what do you do?
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.040]   What do you do if you're an Alex Hormozy
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.460]   or someone else who's been phenomenally successful
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.640]   at everything you've ever set your mind to?
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.080]   And I use him because it's hard to come up
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.960]   with a better example.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:25.840]   very financially successful, all self-made, did it his own way, drawing himself up. He's achieved
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:31.200]   fame, modest internet fame, but fame in certain circles, looked up to, admired by many,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.380]   married to a beautiful woman who he loves. They seem to have a wonderful relationship together.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:43.740]   And he's got tremendous physical shape. He has the ability to come and go and do whatever he
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:48.560]   wants in the world. And he's 30 years old. What would you do if you were he?
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:59.640]   Well, you have to establish purpose. And that purpose can't just always be growing bigger
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.760]   companies. And again, I'm not picking on an Alex, I'm picking on Hermosa. I bet he's done this.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.180]   But you need to think, okay, 30 to 40, what's going to be that area of focus? What problems
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.480]   am I going to tackle? 40 to 50, what are some problems that I'm not going to tackle now,
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.720]   but some problems that I really want to tackle? And I'm not going to tackle them now, but I'm
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:18.300]   going to tackle them then. What's a career that I would really like to have from 50 to 60?
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:26.020]   In order for you to experience the fullness of these decisions, you will want to incorporate
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:32.460]   some sense of generation, meaning through the generations of people into your life.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:39.840]   And so one of the most empowering things that you can do when you're 35 years old or 40 years old,
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.700]   especially, I mean, in addition to your own children, especially if you don't have children,
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:50.300]   is you need to bring in a crop of 15-year-olds or 22-year-olds or 30-year-olds and start training
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:57.380]   the next generation. And as you watch their success and you see your ability to reproduce,
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:05.960]   you will derive much more joy and satisfaction from that than you will from just doing more
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:13.680]   of what you want to do. Back finally to the point of variety of life.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:23.280]   If you're going to build a life and a lifestyle that is meaningful, you are primarily going to
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:32.760]   experience the greatest joys in your ability to impact the lives of other people, not in higher
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:41.080]   and higher levels of consumption for yourself. Hedonism is fun for a very short period of time.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.660]   After that short period of time, you're going to experience the greatest joys in your ability to
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.660]   impact the lives of other people, not in higher and higher levels of consumption for yourself.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:51.800]   Your mind and body and psychology will adapt to whatever it is that you are expressing in a
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:58.760]   hedonistic way, and you will need some new stimulation to get you going again. It's a
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:05.920]   cheap thrill that feels good for the moment, but doesn't last. But investing into other people,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:13.440]   investing into your neighbor, investing into your neighbor's children, investing into the next
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:19.020]   generation and the next generation and the next generation, be that generations of impact that
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.500]   ripple out from you through your fellow man, or be it generations down through the ages,
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.500]   continually impacting the younger generation, the younger generation, the younger generation
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:34.860]   for the future of humanity, that's where you will ultimately draw the largest source of satisfaction.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:41.940]   So in conclusion, I want you to do both of these things.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:50.060]   I want you to get married. I want you to have babies, because I think that you will gain immense
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:58.080]   amounts of life satisfaction from that decision. In a separate episode, I will talk to those of
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.120]   you who are saying, but Joshua, I might get divorced. I just simply want to say to you,
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.980]   and I might lose half my stuff, right? And after all, she didn't do anything to earn it,
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.600]   why would I take the risk? I can't find a decent spouse anyway.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.960]   I'll deal with that in a separate episode. What I want to tell you is that victory has never
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:24.520]   belonged to the timid. Never in the history of humanity have the weak and the timid and the
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:33.480]   fearful ultimately come to conquer. Victory has always gone to the bold.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:41.440]   If you want to be surrounded by your great-grandchildren on your 85th birthday,
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.040]   and you want to see yourself as the patriarch of a dynasty,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:52.360]   and you want to see your ability to impact the world, you are going to have to start
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:58.640]   that process long before there is any certainty of victory.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:05.980]   I've been thinking a lot about Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great was only great
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:11.360]   in other people's eyes at the end of his conquest.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.900]   At the beginning of his conquest, he was simply Alex.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:24.600]   Now, I don't want you to go off and set across the world raping and pillaging and conquering
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.880]   your fellow people with violence. The point is that if you are going to be great,
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:38.260]   you are going to have to make risky decisions. And there is nothing in life that you can do
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.680]   that does not entail risk.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:49.340]   You might marry poorly. You might be divorced. Your wife might take your children and you never
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:57.800]   speak to them again. That is possible. But it's one of those things that if you're not willing
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:05.680]   to take the risk, you never have the possibility of conquering, of building a dynasty, of building
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.440]   a life of satisfaction. So when you're 95 years old, in your ornate character, you're not going
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:10.660]   to be able to take the risk. You're not going to be able to take the risk. You're not going to be
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:22.760]   surrounded by your 113 great-grandchildren. It's not easy, but it's doable. And here's the
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:30.000]   other thing about risk. In the same way that military risk is largely predictable, well,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:39.180]   not entirely, virtually all of the risks of marriage, children, etc. are also predictable.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.460]   They're not random.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:49.640]   You don't just randomly win military victory over somebody. It comes with strategy, with research,
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.980]   with spying out the land, and then making intelligent decisions. Now, the battle can
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:39:00.840]   go against you in certain occasions. But as we talk about in this series, it's not random.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:08.320]   So let me stop with my monologue and simply say, I want you to have that. I believe that's worth
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.440]   working towards. I've been working towards it for a long time. I've been working towards it for a
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:16.860]   more than a decade. It feels really good when I compare my life as compared to some of my friends
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:23.160]   who have made different choices. I also want you to have everything else. Because if you're not
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.400]   able to marry or you're not able to have children, life is not over. But I want you to recognize that
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.920]   you need to insert that into your life. You need to build that into your life. And the things that
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.680]   you're going to value the most is going to come from your service to others, especially as it
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.420]   ripples through the generations. So I want you to have everything else. And I want you to have everything
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.100]   that you're going to value the most. So I want you to have everything else. And I want you to have
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:43.120]   everything else. And I want you to have everything else. And I want you to have everything else.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:49.920]   I want to encourage you as I close today's show. If you have not yet come and signed up for the
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.860]   event that I'm holding in January in Panama, I want to encourage you to do that. Go to

[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.600]   environment for one week talking about internationalization,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.400]   the social and economic environment, and the social and economic environment.
