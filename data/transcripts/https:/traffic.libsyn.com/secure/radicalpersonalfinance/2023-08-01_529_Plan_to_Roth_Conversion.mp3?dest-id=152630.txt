[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.980]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.860]   your host today. We're going to take a medium dive into 529 plans. We're going to engage in some
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.980]   careful financial planning. I'm going to share with you how you can use 529 plans very effectively
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.100]   to lower your overall taxes for educational benefits for you, your family members, etc.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.380]   In today's podcast, I'm also going to update you on the recent legislation that has changed in the
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.540]   United States that now allows 529 plans to be rolled into a Roth IRA. I'm going to share with
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.400]   you a few planning ideas of how you can put this into practice for your children, especially if
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.940]   you have young children. I'll share with you how to kind of exploit these ideas. And then I'll also
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.540]   continue and share with you where this may not be such a big impact. It has been a while since I've
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.360]   the details of 529 plans. Lately, I've been talking about investing in your children in ways other than
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.140]   saving money, a long series on that. But this is nothing new to Radical Personal Finance. If you're
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.060]   interested in a fairly good and deep level introduction to 529 plans, go back and listen
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:23.060]   to episodes 138, 154, and 158 of Radical Personal Finance. I will link those episodes in the notes
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.480]   for you. But 138, 154, and 158 were a
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.500]   three-part masterclass on 529 plans, also known as qualified tuition programs. That's what the
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.380]   IRS technically refers to them as, is qualified tuition programs. And in those episodes,
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.880]   I shared with you all of the details of how you can use 529 plans and exploit them.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.720]   Here in this episode, let me give you a quick overview of what a 529 plan is so that you get
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.700]   an idea of its advantages and its drawbacks. Basically, a 529 plan works basically like an
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.760]   account that you can put money into and then use the money for educational purposes on a tax
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.800]   favorable basis. Now, there are ordinarily two kinds of qualified tuition programs. By the way,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.840]   I'm going to use these terms interchangeably. I usually, however, will refer to 529 plan to refer
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.880]   to the kind of accumulation account rather than a prepaid tuition program. But there are two kinds.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.240]   There are what's called a prepaid tuition program, which is an arrangement that you make with a
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.080]   specific school or university.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.920]   To prepay tuition to that institution. And then there's the type that you just simply have an
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.680]   account, an account that has investments in it, can frequently hold mutual funds.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.020]   And that account allows you to accumulate money for your children's educational expenses,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.980]   or they can be yours as well. I'll usually refer to this as being for your children,
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.680]   but it can be for you or for your children. So let's discuss the taxation. How does the tax work?
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.240]   Well, if you put money into the account, you use after tax dollars to fund the account.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.600]   So you earn a dollar, you pay tax on it. Let's say you pay 20 cents of tax.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.080]   Then you take 80 cents and you put 80 cents into the investment account. There is no upfront tax
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.520]   break on the money that gets contributed into the account. You invest the money,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.000]   hopefully for gain over time. And when you take the money out, as long as the money is
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.420]   distributed from the account for qualified educational expenses, then you are not required
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.140]   to pay the income tax.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.380]   So let's say that you earned a dollar, you paid 20 cents of income tax, you put 80 cents into the
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.000]   account. You invested that 80 cents wisely. Over time, the 80 cents grew to be worth $1.20.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.180]   And now you take the $1.20 out and use it for qualified educational expenses.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.780]   Well, because you invested through a qualified tuition program, through a 529 account,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.000]   you are not required to pay tax on the gain, on that 40 cents
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.700]   of gain. So you save whatever your effective tax rate would otherwise be on your 40 cents of gain.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.680]   Let's say that you're about that 20, 25 cent tax rate. That means that you save about 10 cents
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.980]   worth of tax. Good thing to do. It's nice to save money on tax. Now, when I use those numbers,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.360]   you will probably see, however, one of the first things that I like to point to,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.800]   which is that in many cases, the actual tax benefits on these types of accounts are more modest than
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.760]   people otherwise believe. We should lower taxes whenever possible because that lowers our overall
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.860]   expenses and increases our effective investment gains. But when you are just eliminating the tax
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.480]   on the gain of an asset, unless there's a very significant amount of gain, the actual savings
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.840]   that we get may be fairly modest. And this is the thing that I frequently have pointed out to people
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   who invest through 529 accounts.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.940]   In many cases, people fund these accounts far too lightly. They invest for too short of a time.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.100]   And the actual tax benefits, while real, are not spectacular. And so I demote these accounts
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.860]   in priority from other types of accounts or other types of financial priorities
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.980]   and areas of focus because of this fairly modest overall savings opportunity.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.780]   It's just often not that much money. But that doesn't mean it can't be a lot of money. And it
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:38.500]   doesn't mean that tax savings are the only reason why we would use these types of account. So where
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.340]   I have frequently recommended these accounts the most heavily has to do with them being used at an
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:53.120]   early stage of life, with the money being invested for a long period of time, and as much money
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.200]   invested up front as is possible. And so I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.000]   really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.200]   Let's begin with the amount of money that you can contribute to these accounts. They are limited to
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.680]   a reasonable amount of money as is necessary for somebody's college expenses. Some states have
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.460]   certain numbers. But the only real limit on them is that you can't contribute more on an annual
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:25.000]   basis than the annual exclusion amount, which is a number that changes by the IRS every year. And
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.500]   that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.840]   that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:35.660]   one individual can give to another individual. In 2023, the annual exclusion amount is $17,000. Now, a
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.720]   529 account is also interesting because it allows you to front load five years of your annual
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:50.820]   exclusion amount into the plan if you want to. So if you take $17,000 and you multiply it times
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.800]   five, that's $85,000 that you could put into an account. And that's a really good point. And I think
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.300]   that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. And
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.420]   account for your beneficiary. The other interesting thing about a 529 account is that you can split
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:08.540]   this amount over two members of a married couple. So if you have a husband that can contribute $85,000
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:15.380]   and a wife that can contribute $85,000, well, now, of course, we can put $170,000 into the account
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.880]   right up front in the very first year of a beneficiary's life, even if we want to do that.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.600]   And you'll notice I'm referring to beneficiaries here. So if you
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.740]   have, like I do, five children and you want to make large contributions to their educational
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:37.520]   accounts, you could put in $170,000 between husband and wife for child number one, $170,000
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:45.300]   for child number two, $170,000 for child number three, etc. And it's not limited to parents being
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.640]   the only ones who could contribute to the accounts. So grandparents can also contribute to the
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.400]   accounts. And that's some of my favorite ways to use these accounts. Because what happens is these
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.200]   accounts allow a family member to make a gift to another family member, to the beneficiary,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.320]   but they are not a taxable gift. And when the money is used for the purposes of education,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:15.000]   then now it comes out on a tax favorable basis. Because the amounts of money can get very large
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.120]   so quickly when we're doing it this way, these are one of my favorite tools for the very wealthy.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.640]   And let me add a couple of benefits that you may not immediately perceive.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:33.220]   So there are the benefits, obviously, of the tax deferral and the tax savings when the money is used
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:39.340]   for education. That is a benefit. And if you can front load these accounts and have quite a lot of
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:47.260]   time for the money to grow, now the tax savings can be really substantial. Just imagine that a
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:54.000]   $170,000 for each of their grandchildren on the day the child is born. Well, that $170,000
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.180]   can have a decade to grow before it's being used for secondary school expenses, can have 18 years
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.800]   to grow before it's being used for college expenses, may have 25 years to grow before
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.700]   it's being used for medical school or other professional law school expenses, etc. And so
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:19.740]   that $170,000 has quite a lot of time where it can generate gain. And thus the savings on the tax
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.800]   from that gain can be really, really significant. Another attribute
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:30.500]   of this from a technical perspective, though, is that from a technical perspective, this is assumed
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:38.740]   to be a completed gift. So thus it's a transfer out of the wealthy grandparent's estate into the
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:45.660]   estate of the beneficiary. However, unlike most other transfers out of a wealthy person's estate,
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:53.600]   the donor does not give up control of the money. So unlike what is ordinarily required of making
