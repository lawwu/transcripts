[00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.120]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.540]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.700]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.140]   I am your host.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.020]   Today is Friday, September 15, 2023.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.360]   And on this Friday, as we do every Friday in which I can arrange the relevant recording
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.940]   technology, we do live Q&A.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.340]   It works just like call-in talk radio.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.400]   Call in, ask about anything you want, raise any topic of conversation, raise any argument
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.200]   that you want, ask me any question that you want.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.960]   You can join one of these Friday Q&A shows by becoming a patron of the show at patreon.com
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.180]   slash radical personal finance, patreon.com slash radical personal finance.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.700]   By the way, I encourage you that this is probably the cheapest and easiest way to talk to me.
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.160]   We don't talk about a ton of personal stuff, of course, but if you want to talk to me,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.440]   this is one of your simplest and cheapest ways to do that.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.600]   So patreon.com slash radical personal finance.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.760]   We begin with Matt in Florida.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.600]   Matt, welcome to the show.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.400]   How can I serve you today?
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500]   It's my first time calling in, but a long-time listener.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.080]   Appreciate all the work that you do.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.580]   My pleasure.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:09.500]   My question is surrounding pursuing business versus being more involved in raising my young kids.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.360]   We have a two-and-a-half-year-old that is currently in daycare three days a week and
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.720]   then a six-month-old that we're looking at kind of childcare options and trying to hold
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.480]   off until she's at least a year old.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.060]   And I currently run my own business, been in it about two years and kind of am almost,
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.060]   like, part-time, maybe like 35 hours a week so I can spend time with my kids.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.360]   We have my older daughter in daycare part-time.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.060]   And kind of at this impasse, you know, as we get, you know, we have a part-time nanny
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.000]   as well for the younger one and trying to figure out what, whether to, whether I should
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.280]   pursue growing my business more or I should take a step back and spend more time with
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.500]   my kids at this pivotal age.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.600]   Okay.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.240]   So that's what I'm wrestling with.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.200]   Not a specific question, but just figured I'd throw that out there for you.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   Talk a little bit about that.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   No, it's a super important one.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.080]   One of the basic reasons we work generally for parents is to be able to provide for our
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.340]   children.
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.080]   And so the challenging interplay between should I work more in order to generate more money
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   and invest that money into them or do I need time?
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   How do I invest time versus money, et cetera?
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.480]   What is the involvement of your children's mother in their lives and in your household?
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.540]   She is, so she has a full-time job.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.980]   She does not want to stay home with kids and her job is, she is in office three days a
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.300]   week.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.960]   And then like Monday and Friday, she is at home and we kind of, she is very involved
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   when she is home.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.380]   Sure, of course.
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.780]   With child care.
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.060]   And how much money does she earn per year?
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.840]   Roughly $90,000.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.740]   Your business is generating about how much profit per year?
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.520]   About $100,000.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.500]   And what are your household expenses?
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.540]   Let's see.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:22.780]   All it's kind of between with daycare and everything probably in the $60,000 range.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.260]   Okay.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.800]   Well, the basic problem here is,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.000]   is not a problem of kind of what would be best for the children.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.540]   The basic problem that you have is going to be how do my wife and I work this out in our
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.180]   relationship?
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.800]   So, and then, you know, how long does this work?
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.860]   Let me ask just a couple more questions.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.820]   Do you have, tell me a little bit about your vision, right?
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.020]   You've got very young children.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.380]   Tell me a little bit about your vision for your eight-year-old, your 12-year-old, your
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.000]   18-year-old.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.340]   What's your vision as a father?
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:07.300]   I don't necessarily see myself as like a full-time homeschooler as they get older.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.280]   But I mean, like something we would like to do is maybe live abroad for a year and homeschool
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.580]   them for like that single year and then have them either in a charter school or private
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.060]   school once they get to school age.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.540]   Okay.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.540]   And I, of course, want to be very involved with all their extracurriculars.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.900]   And homeschooling them when they come home from school.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.780]   Right, right.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.240]   Your job right, or your business right now demands about 35 hours a week from you.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.920]   Do those hours have to occur during a certain time?
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.260]   Or is there any flexibility there about when that occurs?
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.440]   It's 100% flexible.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.960]   Okay.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.400]   Well, I will try to give you my opinion as straightforwardly as possible.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.520]   I'll identify what is my opinion versus what I think is research.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.000]   Kind of borne out by the experience of other people.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.680]   But it's going to come down to what can you do in your situation and what seems best to
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.880]   do given all the factors.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.300]   And no other man is going to be able to tell you specifically what to do.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:22.960]   It seems to me with every piece of research I've ever read, every article I've ever read,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.720]   every bit of...
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.820]   I can't point to any evidence that would say that you get any better outcome with your children and
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:41.320]   their formation versus your children having a full-time parent involved in their lives,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.080]   or a full-time loved one, a full-time family member.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.600]   One of the things that's super interesting to me is that this is just not talked about.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.560]   This last week I was on Twitter and I got served up a Twitter ad.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.200]   I forget what it was for, but it was something about teachers investing into
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.540]   how teachers in a classroom could solve behavioral issues in their children, etc.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.460]   And I made a snarky comment before clicking on the ad.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.420]   I said, I'm going to go click on the ad, but what's not going to be in the article...
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.020]   I'm going to click on that.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.460]   I can't remember what the ad was for.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.960]   It was an article.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.460]   I said, what's not going to be in the article is simply any discussion of parental involvement
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.360]   and emotional regulation that children have,
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.480]   based upon being with their children.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.860]   And so, of course, I went and I clicked on the article,
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.300]   and lo and behold, there was not a bit of a mention of it.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.800]   And so these teachers are talking about nonviolent communication techniques
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.340]   and how we can teach all these psychological techniques and tendencies to children.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.420]   And there's no discussion of the underlying cause,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.120]   which is that very young children are routinely taken away from their parents,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.920]   and this causes psychological harm and damage in a child's life.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.040]   I can't see any way around that.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.260]   I'm not an expert in this.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.140]   I have no psychology degree,
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.920]   but everything I've ever read indicates that the primary source,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.440]   the primary font of emotional regulation, stability, etc.,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.100]   for a child is his parents, primarily his mother,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.680]   especially in the early days.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.780]   This is well proven at the infant level.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.040]   Everything, you know, skin-to-skin contact.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.260]   It's just demonstrated again and again that everything from the way that a baby regulates his breathing
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.560]   and the mother's and the baby's breathing in sync and the heartbeat in sync,
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.120]   the baby's emotional regulation with the proximity of his mother, etc.,
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.540]   it's obvious at a fundamental biological level
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.500]   that the very best situation for a baby to be in
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.600]   is to be very, very close to his mother at all times.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.840]   And, you know,
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.220]   dads are nice for babies.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.160]   It's nice to be around.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.260]   I enjoy my babies,
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.180]   especially when they get to about six months old.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.160]   But at the end of the day,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.980]   dads can't do much for babies.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.640]   And what's funny is that we've joked about this so long
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.780]   that people don't even see it.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.600]   You go back to,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.620]   what was that movie?
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.460]   I think it was when I was in high school,
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.340]   Meet the Fockers,
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.720]   where they, you know,
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.380]   the guy's got an artificial breast there
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.200]   that he puts the bottle underneath, etc.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.940]   Like you could try to do things,
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.340]   but at the end of the day,
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.060]   we should acknowledge the fact
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.960]   that the fundamental thing that a child,
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.000]   needs is his mother.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.620]   Now, when does a child stop needing his mother?
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.960]   Well, there's a biological point
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.240]   at which a child doesn't need his mother.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.240]   And again, there's ways to assess this.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.200]   You know, if a mother dies during childbirth,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.420]   thank God for amazing formula
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.000]   and ways that we can keep the child alive, etc.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.500]   But at the end of the day,
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.120]   everything needs to be viewed
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.260]   as kind of a step off of the ideal,
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.040]   which is constant communication,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.280]   constant presence.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.440]   So how do you,
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.280]   you know,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.640]   how do you do that interplay
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.240]   between a mother and a father?
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.560]   Well, I think that
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.400]   if a child can't have his mother,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.900]   then he definitely should have his father.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.740]   Why?
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.360]   Well, there's no one else in the world
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.540]   other than the child's mother
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.620]   who's going to take a greater interest in the child,
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.200]   who's going to pay more attention to the child,
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.720]   who's going to pay,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.860]   who's going to care about the child more
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.760]   at a deeper level.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.240]   And so anything that a father can do
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.320]   to be with his children
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.400]   and to encourage them
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.420]   and to be their presence
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   is fundamental to the formation of the child.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.620]   Everything I've ever learned
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.680]   about kind of early childhood formation
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.720]   indicates that most of who a child is
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.700]   gets built in the first years of a child's life.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.540]   I can't quote all of the data
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.120]   off the top of my head as I would like to,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.980]   but, you know,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.340]   vocabulary acquisition is largely set in place
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.640]   by the time a child is a few years old.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.640]   Values, the way that you interact with people,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.340]   all of these things are,
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.960]   are set in place in a child's first few years.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.560]   And everything about that
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.520]   is fundamental to who your children
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.380]   ultimately wind up being.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.800]   If your children are touched a lot,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.680]   have lots of physical comfort,
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.500]   lots of hugs,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.320]   lots of snuggles,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.620]   it fundamentally affects them.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.780]   It affects their growth rates.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.440]   You can go and you can find studies in orphanages
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.420]   where the children are just left in a crib
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.260]   and they're not touched
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.100]   and they're not snuggled
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.960]   and they're not played with.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.280]   And it just, it stunts their growth.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.640]   It stunts their intellectual capacity.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.200]   It stunts their physical ability.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.840]   It stunts their physical capacity.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.880]   I've never seen a single bit of research
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.640]   that would argue with the common sense understanding
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.980]   we have that children need their parents,
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.100]   primarily their mother,
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.280]   in the beginning years.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.460]   Now, it has been a fact
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.640]   and remains a fact throughout human history
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.780]   that we can't always have perfection,
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.420]   quote unquote.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.180]   We can't always have that.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.100]   And so if we're going to come off of that ideal standard
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.180]   for some reason,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.700]   we have to then say,
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.540]   what's the best that we can create in these circumstances?
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.900]   So probably the perfect standard,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.720]   if we were looking for perfection,
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.000]   would be that a child would be with his mother
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.320]   and his father in the home
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.360]   with his grandmother and his grandfather right there
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.200]   and surrounded by community 168 hours a week.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.180]   That would probably be perfect.
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.520]   Well, of course, that's not going to happen.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.720]   Even if mom is a full-time mom,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.520]   mom needs a break,
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.860]   mom needs to sleep, et cetera.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.780]   So I take my babies for,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.380]   lots of times so that mom can have a break.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.800]   Moms and dads need breaks.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.780]   And so, you know,
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.660]   having a chance where there's other people involved.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.220]   But we want to get as close to that as is possible
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.440]   given the various constraints that we face in our situation.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.500]   Mom and dad can't be there all the time.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.680]   Somebody has their own income.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.420]   Otherwise, we all starve and go hungry.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.380]   There may be some variation of that.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.120]   So if we're going to introduce variation to that,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.720]   we want to do it in the smartest way possible.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.540]   So,
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.100]   you know,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.360]   moms and dads have jobs and have businesses.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:55.780]   Well,
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.220]   we want to get as close to that loving environment as we can.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.920]   So is there a grandparent who can come into the home
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.160]   and the child's in his own home where he's comfortable,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.600]   where everything is there,
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.040]   and yet he's together with a grandparent?
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.340]   Why?
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.140]   Because a grandparent is going to care a lot more about the child
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.320]   on a deep fundamental level than as a paid caregiver.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.180]   If we're going to institutionalize the child,
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.300]   we should be very careful about that
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.180]   and only do it when it's necessary
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.760]   and only to the highest,
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.680]   level possible.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.420]   The problem is that it's almost impossible
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.800]   to institutionalize a child
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.180]   and get anywhere near the high level of care
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.940]   and the high level of input
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.600]   that a child can receive at home
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.060]   simply due to the economics of institutionalization.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.600]   Any parent who has two children knows
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.040]   that when you have two children,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.540]   your attention and your ability to serve both children simultaneously
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.680]   is now distracted.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.440]   You can't provide the same,
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.720]   focused attention.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.120]   And so there should be some kind of offsetting comparison.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.220]   By this argument, by the way,
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:58.860]   we could point out,
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.180]   well, maybe it wouldn't be smart for anyone
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.120]   to have more than one child.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.120]   We're not, you know,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.100]   I don't agree with that
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.220]   because I think children gain more
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.300]   from peer relationships within the family.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.560]   But at the end of the day,
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.200]   we should look at it through that lens.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.220]   And so if we take a child
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.040]   and we go to the fanciest daycare in our town
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.440]   and you say,
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.220]   here's the best institutionalized daycare I can find.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.100]   It's going to be for six hours a day
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.600]   and they have a lot of time.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.760]   They have eight students and two teachers, etc.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.800]   Well, who's teaching that teacher?
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.720]   Most of, you know,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.100]   I have a master's degree.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.620]   My wife has a bachelor's degree
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.160]   and she could easily do any degree that she wants to.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.040]   We're both very intelligent,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.800]   very thoughtful,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.400]   very patient people, etc.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   I'm not going to go out in the world
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.340]   and be able to find a daycare
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.720]   that's with eight children
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.520]   and two people who are highly educated,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.580]   have high standards for their personal life,
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.720]   have high standards for their personal behavior, etc.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.360]   and provide the same level of care.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.280]   It's much more likely
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.000]   that the people then caring for my child
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.560]   are going to be less educated,
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.520]   less intelligent,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.300]   less under emotional control.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.480]   They may or may not represent the basic values
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.160]   that I hold, that my wife holds.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.900]   They're certainly not going to be able
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.280]   to take the same amount of time
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.540]   and invest into the children
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.080]   and they're not going to be able to do it
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.060]   in the focused way
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.800]   that we might be able to do it.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.120]   And so if we begin with the idea
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.200]   and the very clear understanding
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:21.680]   that to me,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.560]   anything except for the child
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.040]   and to accept that standard is subpar,
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.060]   then we can come back and figure out,
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.060]   well, how do we deal with it?
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.840]   Because we all accept subpar results
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.580]   in our lives in some ways.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.100]   So in your specific situation,
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.640]   a lot of what you choose to do
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.540]   is going to be based, number one,
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.940]   on how you and your wife can work together
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.320]   and what your vision is for your children
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.280]   and how important this is to you.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.920]   There are plenty of perfectly reasonable,
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.340]   contented, well-adjusted adults
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.540]   who have been raised
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.020]   in institutionalized settings.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.260]   And so I don't think that you're a failure as a man
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.320]   if this is what you have to do.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.400]   Better for you to keep your marriage intact
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.480]   and find the best nanny for your home
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.580]   that you possibly can
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.840]   and better for you to find the best daycare
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.540]   for your elder child that you possibly can
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.720]   and keep your marriage intact
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.360]   than for you to kind of go to your wife
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.660]   and say, woman, stay at home with the children.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.900]   I don't care how you feel.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.380]   I don't care.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.340]   Like that's not a recipe for success.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.320]   That's not good, proper masculine leadership in your home.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.120]   And so you have to make sure that you find something.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.740]   But at the end of the day,
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.640]   it's gonna probably come down to the level
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.660]   of your personal conviction and what you share.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.160]   I have a very intense level
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.000]   of personal conviction about these things.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.960]   And so, and this goes on from not only early childhood,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.820]   but it goes on from early childhood to education.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.920]   I have had the conviction for decades.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.340]   I mean, and I'm not exactly,
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.320]   I'm not exaggerating when I say decades.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.720]   No, I mean, since I was a teenager,
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.740]   I had the conviction that I cared deeply
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.480]   about the education of my children.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.220]   I cared deeply about their academics.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.160]   I cared deeply about their social formation,
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.800]   their spiritual formation, et cetera.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.400]   And I've had the conviction that if my wife was dead,
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.560]   if my wife divorced me, if my wife couldn't do it,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.240]   if I had to have a job, I would move to a cheaper place.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.540]   I'd live in a smaller apartment.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.500]   I'd work in the nights and on the weekends.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.660]   I'm gonna be involved in some way,
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.240]   or I'm gonna be involved in some other way.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.480]   I'm going to find care
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.020]   that's at a very high level for my child.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.860]   So maybe I can have a grandparent come in and help.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.600]   Maybe I can bring someone in,
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.120]   or I can find another family that shares our values.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.200]   And instead of my child being institutionalized
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.440]   with eight other children all of the same age,
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.020]   maybe there's a family that I could just pay,
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.640]   a wonderful homeschooling mother
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.740]   that I could pay to have our two children
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.100]   in that kind of home environment because I respect it.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.140]   I'm gonna find the very best care
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.320]   and the very best solutions that I can.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.960]   And again, this is common to all parents.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.400]   This is why parents look around for what's the best school.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.360]   And these words are subjective.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.500]   We have to argue about what do they actually mean?
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   What is the best school?
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.720]   What is the best education?
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.480]   But at its core, we're all looking for the best
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.640]   with these basic factors around.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.300]   Now, the hard thing that you're asking me about
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.140]   is what is the influence at an early age
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.280]   versus at a later age?
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.420]   So for example, I have strong convictions
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.040]   about my child.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.600]   I have strong convictions about schooling and education.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.900]   I believe that we can do so much more for our children
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.660]   from an academic perspective,
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.200]   from a schooling perspective, et cetera.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.180]   But I want to hasten to add
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.940]   that that's different at different ages.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.400]   It's one thing at six years old.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.220]   It's another thing at 16 years old.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.480]   I think that many 16-year-olds can thrive
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.260]   in an institutionalized school setting.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.800]   You can find a great school.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.060]   There may be great government schools,
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.020]   great private schools,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.860]   many students in that space can thrive.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.000]   Excuse me just one moment.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.380]   So we don't have to argue that this is the same at all ages.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.840]   But I think those early years are really, really core.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.360]   But what I'm pointing out is that what matters
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.940]   is going to be your level of conviction personally.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.580]   So if I woke up in your shoes,
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.660]   because I have a high level of conviction
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.720]   about these topics,
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.600]   I would first,
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.800]   try to see,
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.260]   is there a wonderful family member
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.020]   or a wonderful nanny
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.540]   or someone who could be involved in our household
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.700]   so that we could both maintain our income in some way?
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.540]   So let's say that if your wife is working from home
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.560]   on Monday and Friday
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.300]   and she's out of the house on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.060]   I would look and I would see,
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.980]   is there a wonderful nanny that we could find
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.140]   that could be very focused on the children
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.500]   and support them to the highest level,
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.060]   almost like a mother,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.920]   but do it within the constraints of our own home
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.000]   and do it in such a way
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.340]   that we could provide for our income.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.160]   And I think that's probably the best way to do it.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.900]   Because for you to walk away entirely from your income
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.780]   to be Mr. Dad,
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.680]   that's probably not a great move
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.540]   for the long-term welfare of your family.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.820]   It's also probably not a great move for your marriage.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.580]   It's a very unusual marriage
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.680]   that I think that would,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.340]   that would continue to be healthy for a long time.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.000]   It can happen.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.340]   I've known a few families
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.800]   that seem to have navigated that
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.480]   and that seems to be really work well,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.540]   but that's unusual in kind of male-female dynamics
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.860]   for that to be something that's going to continue.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.740]   So I would look for that.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.560]   And then I would just say,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.480]   how could I adjust and adapt my schedule
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.960]   around these particular needs that my family has?
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.660]   And if you have a flexible work environment,
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.360]   then I would change my hours
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.300]   so that when that nanny wasn't available,
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.500]   then I could work around my children in some way
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.580]   and still be very, very close to them.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.160]   Now, that's for these years,
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.060]   kind of preschool,
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.420]   preschooling years.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.980]   When you get to schooling,
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.260]   in order for you not to just simply find
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.760]   a very high-quality private school or something,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.680]   which is where your income is going to be important,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.400]   in order for you not to just find
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.620]   a very high-level private school,
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.640]   you would have to have some kind
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.720]   of vision or indication around education broadly.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.620]   You'd have to develop your own commitment.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.680]   My schooling of my children
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.220]   has come with a significant cost to my time,
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.780]   to my business, et cetera.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.440]   I continue to do it because I care very deeply about it,
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.520]   and I believe that it's the right decision for me.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   But I also recognize I have a very high level of conviction,
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.680]   and it seems to be working well with my children.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.900]   And so I think that's a decision
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.140]   that you could make kind of around the edges.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.300]   I don't know,
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.840]   I don't think it would be impossible for you
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.020]   to maintain your business
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.620]   and do a great job with your children.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.060]   I would just fight like crazy to make sure
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.320]   that on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.480]   when my wife is at her job,
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.720]   that if there's a nanny in our home
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.040]   for say four to six hours
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.620]   or whatever it is that you work out,
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.240]   that I'm aware of what's going on
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.840]   while I'm doing my work in the other room
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.020]   and working it out flexibly.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.760]   And then ideally,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.600]   if she's willing to work out,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.760]   if she can be there on Monday and Friday
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.920]   when her job is there,
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.300]   then, and again, if it's in our home,
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.260]   we can eliminate a lot of the separation issues.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.720]   We can eliminate a lot of the dynamics
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.360]   of a bunch of children of the same age
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.220]   being pushed together
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.980]   and all of the bad things that come out of that.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.340]   We can eliminate not knowing what's going on
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.280]   in terms of the low quality attention
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.740]   and or outright abuse that can occur
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.460]   in an institutionalized setting, et cetera.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.060]   And that seems probably the best way to balance it.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.580]   I don't know that that gives you any direction,
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.260]   but I think if I woke up in your shoes,
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.960]   I would keep a flexible business.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.040]   I would try to increase my effectiveness at work.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.860]   Remember that it's quality of time at work
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.300]   that counts for results
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.900]   and quantity of time at home that counts.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.840]   And so there is no such thing as quality time
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.080]   when it comes to parenting and family relationships.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.340]   That was a myth that was made up in the 1980s
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.180]   by parents with a guilty conscience that said,
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.560]   well, I may not have much time,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.720]   but I have quality time.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.200]   It's nonsense.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.880]   There's no such thing as quality time with children.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.160]   Children just want your presence
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.520]   and your attention, et cetera.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.000]   But with work, it's all about quality time.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.180]   So it's quality of time at work that counts
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.060]   and quantity of time at home that makes the difference.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.060]   And so if you can,
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.780]   with the benefits of having your own business,
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.940]   especially one that's profitable,
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.340]   if you can manipulate your hours a little bit
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.640]   and maybe you go from 35 to 25 hours,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.300]   but you keep 80% of your results
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.340]   and that frees you up when,
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.560]   combined with bringing in somebody to the home
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.280]   or finding a family member,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.640]   grandma and grandpa or a neighbor
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.280]   or somebody kind of close to you
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.580]   that's not in a strictly institutional setting,
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.940]   you make plenty of money.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.120]   And I think that that would pay off well
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.960]   in terms of the investment over these years.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.260]   And then as your children get into school age years,
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.600]   then I think it's a lot simpler
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.560]   because there are some really wonderful schools
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.320]   that you could find
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.260]   that work much better than daycares.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.280]   Daycares are an evil necessity.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.520]   They are an evil necessity
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.740]   of a broken world with broken relationships
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.180]   and families that can't provide
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.080]   what the family is designed to do.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.920]   They are an evil necessity.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.640]   Schools, I think, can be looked at differently.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.120]   And so if you could find a very high quality,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.640]   if you invested this way over the next three, four years
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.340]   and your children reach that point
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.700]   at which they can go into school
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.080]   and they're emotionally stable,
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.020]   you've imparted that confidence to them
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.020]   that comes from a close, intimate relationship
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.900]   with mother and father,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.500]   then the school can be looked at differently.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.140]   The school, I think, can be your aid
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.200]   as long as it's carefully chosen by you.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.920]   And then you would be free to go back to your business
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.300]   and kind of work more conventional hours, et cetera.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.680]   So that would be my general approach.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.740]   Yeah, that's very helpful.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.500]   Yeah, I've noticed like the negative effects
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.880]   of my toddler being in daycare,
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.480]   even though it's only three days a week.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.540]   And that's really what's, you know,
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.580]   we've had a part-time nanny for the baby right now.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.320]   And that's been,
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.040]   that's been a really good feedback situation
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.880]   where I'm kind of listening and see how they're doing.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.900]   And if I hear a little bit too much fuss in this,
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.920]   I jump up and see what's up.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.580]   And she does a really good job with them.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.760]   And I think that's what I'm constantly now
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.080]   is do we pull our toddler out of that daycare
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.340]   and just have a nanny at home
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.220]   where I can still work a little bit,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.320]   bring in some money,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.140]   but also have plenty of time with my kids.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.840]   So that was very helpful.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.740]   It's not an easy situation you're in,
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.480]   but just remember that you have a responsibility
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.680]   to keep your family intact,
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.720]   which means you are responsible to care for your wife
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.520]   and for her needs.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.080]   There's an element of leadership that's involved in that.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:12.000]   I think many mothers don't understand at a deep level
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.240]   the importance of their presence and their work
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.220]   in their children's lives.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.660]   Not all mothers seem to be like emotionally connected
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.980]   to their children.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.140]   And so there are exceptions.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.280]   But I think a lot of times,
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.860]   one of the biggest challenge that mothers have
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.340]   in our intensely feminist culture
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.580]   is that they don't have any vision or experience
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.640]   of what it means to be a mother.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.220]   And this to me is perfectly understandable.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.980]   If a woman has spent 25 years of her life
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:45.300]   being fed the doctrine that her success in life
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.120]   is based upon how much money she makes,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.800]   her career ambitions, her job, et cetera,
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.420]   then for her to just be able to do that,
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.580]   to just spin on a dime and all of a sudden say,
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.060]   well, now I'm gonna be a mom and bake cookies and et cetera,
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.340]   that can feel like a very empty and hollow thing.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.580]   And if she doesn't understand
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.200]   or have a vision for her children,
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.880]   that's the kind of thing that can take time.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.500]   So I would say, one is I would ask,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.560]   have you really invested into your wife?
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.140]   Have you really raised her vision?
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.400]   Have you established a family vision
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.000]   of what your personal vision is as a father?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.940]   That's your job is to cast the vision
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.400]   and then to bring your wife into the world
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.040]   and bring your wife into that.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.680]   And that's not a fast or easy process sometimes,
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.260]   but I don't want, obviously that's quite personal
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.620]   and in a public format like this,
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.280]   I wouldn't go any farther than what I've said,
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.000]   but you need to be the one who casts the vision
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.700]   for your family of here's what it is.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.920]   And you should see your work as a father
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.940]   and she should see her work as a mother
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.680]   as one of those foundational things
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.160]   that contributes massively to society.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.920]   Children are not just accessories.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.380]   They are the necessary,
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.400]   the next generation and your children
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.800]   are the key to a better future.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.060]   And it's as all of us individually invest deeply
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.100]   into our children and do that,
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.200]   then we can build in the most powerful way possible,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.320]   the kind of world that we want our great,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.240]   great, great grandchildren to be born into.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.140]   It doesn't have to be a hundred percent.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.200]   Again, it's not just saying that anything less
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.040]   than 168 hours is the wrong decision,
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.260]   but in terms of the vision,
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.020]   you want to be one of those who's building a vision
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.280]   and not just kind of randomly,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.260]   going through life.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.440]   And, and, and if you don't have that,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.900]   then you spend some time getting it.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.740]   And then when you're together with your children,
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.140]   when you're together with your wife, et cetera,
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.880]   but keep your family together.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.340]   So that means you need to be very sensitive
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.720]   to her needs, et cetera.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.360]   But as a father, it's your ultimate responsibility,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.860]   how your children turn out.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.900]   And you do not want to have any regrets,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.620]   any wished I could have done this.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.840]   And you can always make more money.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.040]   You will never always be able to go back
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.320]   and get, you know, this,
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.200]   this particular time back with your children.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.500]   And so, and I'm repeating for about the fifth time.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.080]   It's not that the number of hours per week
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.360]   is the key metric.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.380]   Fathers have always had to go away.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.380]   Mothers have always had to go away, et cetera.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.900]   It's not the number of hours that is the key metric,
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.940]   but you want to make sure that your child
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.300]   is in the kind of environment
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.840]   that is going to lead to success,
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.120]   lead to strength in the,
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.120]   the nature, in the person that that child is.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.100]   Because otherwise you may spend,
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.480]   as many parents do the rest of your life,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.240]   working to try to undo something
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.640]   that if you could have just avoided it in the first place,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.520]   it would have solved all kinds of things.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.300]   And when you look at the long lasting impact
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.540]   of traumatic experiences, et cetera,
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.400]   on the person that child becomes,
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.300]   it, for me, it has become an obsession to say,
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.640]   I need to make certain that my children,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.820]   my job is to protect my children from these experiences
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.020]   so that they become the most robust people possible.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.800]   And that very much means
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   that I'm not going to take a two-year-old
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.260]   and drop him at a classroom
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.920]   and he's screaming on the other side of the door
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.980]   and his mother and I are walking away
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.760]   as I saw a TikTok video that was shared
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.880]   over the last week or two.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.280]   Those things that happen
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.500]   in those beginning years
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.620]   affect quite literally the rest of a child's life.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.200]   And so they're very, very important.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.860]   And so you can work with them,
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.180]   you can, et cetera,
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.020]   but just recognize that, you know,
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.420]   we don't try to teach mental toughness
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.500]   to a three-year-old.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.460]   13-year-old, absolutely.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.120]   We teach mental toughness.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.520]   We teach difficult situations.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.860]   We want to establish grit in a 13-year-old.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.280]   Three-year-old, not the time, not the place.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.860]   So may God give you wisdom
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.260]   as you continue to seek how to do it.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.160]   Don't just dream about paradise.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.260]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.920]   Escape the ordinary
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.600]   with Fiji Airways Global Beat the Rush Sale.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.180]   Immerse yourself in white sandy beaches
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.520]   or dive deep into coral reefs.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.340]   Fiji Airways has flights to Nadi
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.180]   starting at just $748 for light
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.520]   and just $798 for value.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   Discover your tropical dreams

[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.080]   That's FijiAirways.com.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.520]   From here to happy.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.240]   Flying direct with Fiji Airways.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:26.020]   We go to a thankful listener
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.300]   in the great state of Kansas.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.360]   Welcome, thankful listener.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.960]   Thank you very much, Joshua.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.960]   So first and foremost,
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.060]   I'll thank you very much
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.500]   for your war communication this week.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.260]   My pleasure.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.220]   That's probably the clearest explanation
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.780]   that I've tried to share with others.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.020]   So thank you for sharing that.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.300]   Appreciate that very much.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.660]   My pleasure.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.440]   So general background, mid-50s.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.220]   Believe in the never going to retire concept.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.480]   Have a W2 job consistently,
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.700]   but also have started some business coaching.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.520]   Like some outside feedback,
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.020]   really three business models,
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.120]   timing material, retainer,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.360]   and then what I would call upside,
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.720]   which would be the ability to basically
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.800]   strike a deal on the growth of a business
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.640]   and your contribution to that.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.680]   That's a business model that I'd love to grow in,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.200]   but it takes a lot of time.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.860]   It takes a lot of trust and a lot of success, maybe.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.920]   First time caller for myself too.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.940]   So maybe I'm a little jumbled in trying to present,
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.440]   but just retainer model, time material model,
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.380]   and then an upside model where you benefit
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.560]   as the business that you're coaching benefits.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.500]   Any thoughts or experience that you could share with me?
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.140]   I would think it would depend a lot
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.880]   on the nature of the business
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.640]   and the nature of your contribution.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.160]   There are...
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.620]   Can you tell me any more about any prospective clients
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.500]   that you've been working with
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.480]   and the kind of consulting services?
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.760]   So we could clarify,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.620]   or do you want me to kind of lay out the framework?
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.960]   Nope.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.420]   Mostly independent, smaller businesses.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.300]   Most of them, it's really been around business growth.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.600]   Could be cost control, could be revenue growth,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.780]   could be increasing pricing.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.940]   Some of it's about establishing the confidence
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.840]   to move forward.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.160]   Some growth, you know, 50,000,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.420]   to 100,000, to a million a year in revenue growth
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.180]   based on the feedback and coaching.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:26.540]   Right.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.260]   Well, if it's...
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.840]   It's a very general question, of course.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.440]   And so I don't know that I could do much more
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   than give a general answer,
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.280]   but I would say that it should be based upon
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.220]   the nature of the business,
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.160]   what you think you can contribute,
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.100]   and your needs for overall compensation, et cetera.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.560]   You mentioned I have a W-2 job,
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.240]   and this is on the side at the moment,
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.140]   although your long-term ambition is to continue
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.380]   to contribute in this sense.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.420]   So I would say the first thing is
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.600]   you can always work for free.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.620]   Time and material would be a component of that, I guess.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.300]   But if you just need experience,
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.640]   you need testimonials,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.700]   and you need to prove to yourself
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.760]   to build your confidence,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.480]   working for free, I think,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.460]   is a great solution in many situations.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.220]   Working for free is a great way to get a job.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.560]   Working for free is a great way
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.680]   to get hired as a consultant.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.980]   It can make a tremendous difference.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.320]   And so if you think you have something cool
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.120]   to offer,
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.460]   in an area of consulting or service
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.240]   or marketing implementation or design, et cetera,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.640]   and if you're worried at all about the money,
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.000]   then just offer to work for free
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.140]   or just the cost of your materials
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.340]   or whatever it is that you do,
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.580]   and then collect some results
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.140]   and collect some testimonials.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.360]   Because if you had a portfolio of, say,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.340]   five clients that you have worked with,
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.180]   and each of those clients has had
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.600]   double-digit profit growth,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.640]   and you can directly, in the last 12 months,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.000]   and you can directly see,
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.160]   how your activities and your consulting
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.220]   has led to that double-digit growth,
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.360]   you will feel much more confident
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.560]   than going forward and making an arrangement
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.420]   for an upside percent of the profits,
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.400]   a percent of the increase.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.160]   Whereas if you haven't yet accumulated
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.520]   that portfolio of success,
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.520]   then you might feel ashamed
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.000]   even of a retainer model,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.460]   because how much do I get involved?
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.820]   How much do I charge for things?
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.080]   I think of these things,
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:26.040]   the retainer model is going to be
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.500]   your hardest one to get started
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.300]   until you have clear results.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.740]   There are plenty of business consultants
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.320]   who will come in and charge,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.460]   I mean, $100,000 a day
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.120]   for a top-level marketing consultant
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.820]   is a very reasonable and frequently charged price.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.440]   But those are people who can command
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.160]   a retainer or a direct charge price
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.060]   because of the publicity
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.040]   that they have
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.540]   and the way that they have worked
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.980]   to develop their presence.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:03.460]   And so the retainer model becomes easy
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.960]   when you have built the results,
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.140]   but it's not so easy for someone
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.500]   to just pay you $5,000 for a day
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.800]   when you don't even have those results.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.280]   One of the challenges
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.480]   of any kind of consulting model
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.040]   is making sure that your ideas get implemented.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.180]   So,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.440]   either you,
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.360]   so you have to weed out
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.700]   the implementers from the others in some way.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.740]   So,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.620]   if you're working on an upside model,
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.620]   you want to make sure
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.880]   that you are working with someone
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.580]   that you know is an implementer
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.360]   or you want to be certain
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.780]   that you are given the authority
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.120]   to make sure that plans are followed through on.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.400]   And not all business people
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.080]   will be amenable to that
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.340]   and not all businesses
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.560]   will that really work in.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:51.960]   But for those who do,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.760]   it's your most direct path to big money
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.400]   because if you can come in
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.840]   and either have some kind of share in the profits
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.020]   or have some kind of minority stake in the business
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.840]   or some ownership arrangement
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.860]   or some phantom stock arrangement perhaps
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.740]   that allows you to generate
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.360]   and be paid purely based upon results,
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.120]   that's your biggest money opportunity
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.600]   and your biggest long-term impact.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.240]   But you're going to have to have a connection
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.000]   where you,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.640]   where you make sure that that gets implemented.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.200]   I guess what occurs to me
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.440]   in my final comments
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.580]   is that
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.280]   you should generally work your way up the value chain
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.480]   and
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.220]   your
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.580]   your service,
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.400]   your best customers will often come from people
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.160]   who have paid you a little bit of money.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.360]   So,
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.600]   probably the most interesting model
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:59.020]   would be the DIY, DWI and DFY model.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.400]   I think this is a useful mental framework.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.820]   So, DIY is do-it-yourself.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.180]   So, as a consultant,
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.700]   you have a certain view of the world,
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.740]   a certain amount of intellectual property, etc.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.960]   And so, you should craft some kind of do-it-yourself package,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.360]   some way that you put together your consulting services
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.960]   and you present that to somebody
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.360]   and you offer it to them and say,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.800]   here, you can buy my information package,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.260]   you can buy my seminar,
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.380]   you can buy my hour of consulting
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.860]   or my 10 hours of consulting
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.820]   and you can implement it.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.680]   You can do it yourself.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.000]   And that will usually be your lowest price point
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.100]   because somebody can access your work
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.220]   and they can then take it and implement it themselves.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.140]   Your DWI model would be your done-with-you model.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.740]   So, this is a model where maybe the retainer model
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.040]   would fit this.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.540]   And so, you would craft your solution
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.660]   in an area where you are doing it with them.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.860]   You're there for the implementation,
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.560]   but you're not doing it for them.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.540]   And then the DFY model, the done-for-you model,
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.520]   is your most expensive package
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.320]   in terms of the amount of money that you can make,
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.260]   but it's the one where you're going to just come in
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.120]   and do it for them.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.220]   And that do-it-for-your model
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.120]   would kind of align with the upside arrangement in some way.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.000]   What I think is interesting is
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.720]   you will have different types of solutions
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.100]   and you will have different numbers of clients
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.560]   who will purchase at different levels.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.880]   So, ordinarily, your DIY information package
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.020]   would be consumed by perhaps 100 people.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:35.540]   Your DWI model would be consumed by your perhaps 20%,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.780]   20 out of 100.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.700]   And then your done-for-you model
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.060]   would be consumed by, say, 4 out of the 100, right?
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.620]   And I'm just doing an 80-20 analysis
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.800]   for lack of any more clear data.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.060]   So, 4 out of 100 will buy your done-for-you model.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.260]   And that would be ideal
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:50.700]   because you're going to be able to do a lot of things
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.940]   because you can't work with more than 4 customers.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.020]   But I would bet you that in the fullness of time,
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.440]   you would make 80% of your income and profits
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.260]   from those done-for-you
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.680]   because those are your biggest opportunities.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.300]   But I don't know that you would get to those
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.300]   without working your way up the value chain
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.040]   because you need the 100 people
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.780]   to find out about your ideas
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.580]   in order to attract the 20 people
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.300]   who want to buy your mid-range
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.060]   done-with-you product coaching package
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.300]   in order for you to attract those business owners
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.680]   that are such believers
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.820]   in your value
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.460]   that they will come along
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.040]   and purchase your done-for-you services
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.420]   where they allow you to purchase part of the company,
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.080]   they set up a phantom stock agreement
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.420]   or a profit-sharing agreement, etc.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.620]   for percentage of the increase,
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.300]   and they pay you out over an extended period of time.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.560]   So, I would say that's probably
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.900]   the most useful way to think about it.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.340]   I've always loved that DIY, DWI, and DFY framework
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.260]   as a way to conceptualize your services
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.040]   to serve different people effectively.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.820]   Fantastic. Thank you.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.760]   That's a different perspective
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.420]   that I had never considered.
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.260]   So, thank you.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:58.920]   Good. My pleasure.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.360]   And just remember that
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.760]   publicity goes a long way.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.720]   A guy who's a consultant
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.480]   who all of his work
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.340]   and all of his publicity
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.520]   has come kind of just
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.700]   of his own work
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.160]   is going to have a much harder time
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.460]   than a guy who gets a lot of word-of-mouth results
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.680]   who can point to a good portfolio, etc.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   And so, again, don't be scared to work
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.800]   for free if that's something
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.540]   that is part of your long-term plan.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.180]   We go to Arkansas.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:25.900]   Welcome to the show.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.720]   How can I serve you today?
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.420]   Hi. This is Bob in Arkansas.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.960]   And I had a question about
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.040]   kind of starting a lifestyle business.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.440]   I've been a W-2 employee all my adult life,
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.000]   but I was an entrepreneur as a child.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.300]   And I'm kind of interested in entrepreneurship,
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.160]   again, particularly from a lifestyle business perspective.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.260]   But I sort of struggle with
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.620]   kind of the non-structural
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.180]   and the non-substantive parts of getting started.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.860]   So, like, you know,
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.920]   I'm familiar with the various tax structures,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.840]   but I'm not sure which one would be best
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.240]   for my particular situation.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.320]   I was just curious if you had references
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.080]   for someone who's thinking about
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.500]   starting a business for the
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.960]   non-substantive parts of the business,
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.440]   kind of like all the other pieces.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.060]   When you say non-substantive,
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.940]   I don't understand your use of that word.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.420]   You mentioned taxes, but like, or structure.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.600]   What else do you mean by that?
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   So, I don't know.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.480]   It might be easier for me to just tell you
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.800]   kind of what the business is.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.060]   So, the idea for the business is
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.400]   to buy property in Arkansas
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:36.300]   that has the potential to be great wetland habitat
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.000]   in the winter for ducks.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.500]   Okay.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.060]   And then to take that property
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.480]   and take it from a place that has the potential to that
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.660]   to a place that is that.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.880]   That, you know, ducks and geese love it,
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.580]   and they're going to be able to get into it
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.580]   and then sell that property to people
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.580]   who are interested in duck hunting
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.580]   and then repeat the process if I'm, you know,
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:03.580]   still in a physical position to do it.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.060]   You know, so like trying to do like kind exchanges,
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.700]   obviously to minimize taxes on that part.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.320]   But obviously I would be spending a lot of money
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.960]   on the front end and getting minimal returns
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.540]   for a number of years as trees grow,
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.560]   as you know, as other, as I make other improvements
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   to the property.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   And so is it better for me to try to set up a structure
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   where I could take those losses potentially
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   against other income I have, or is that even possible?
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   And then, you know, to be able to do the like kind exchange
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   down the road for again, more properties that have potential
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   versus one that now is beyond potential
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.560]   to actually is the real thing.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.560]   Right.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.560]   Well, if you're buying the property, ordinarily,
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   you're not going to have any losses.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   Because, and that's, you know, that's the real thing.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   And there's not going to, this is not going to matter
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   from a corporate structure perspective.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.560]   So first, when you're dealing with land,
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   you have no depreciation.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   Land is not depreciated.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.560]   Only improvements to land gets depreciated.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   And in addition, your losses would be in that sense,
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   capital losses rather than active or passive income losses.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   And capital losses are deductible,
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   but only when they're actually realized.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.560]   So that's very different than going and starting a business
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.560]   and you're going to have business startup costs, et cetera.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   And you may lose $30,000 in the first year
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.560]   that you would offset other income against other earned income
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   because it's an active business where corporate structure makes sense.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   And what you're describing, the corporate structure isn't going to matter
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   because you're just going to have gains.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.560]   And as you said, and ideally you're going to have gains,
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   and those gains could be sheltered primarily through a like kind exchange.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   And regardless, those gains are probably going to be
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   a long-term capital gain, which again, be taxed lightly.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   And your pathway to do that tax efficiently is going to be a long-term capital gains.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   So I don't think that I don't see any, from what you're describing to me,
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.560]   I don't see any kind of big winner or any brilliant idea
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.560]   from a corporate structure perspective.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   I would imagine, I mean, obviously you're going to be buying some trees and whatnot,
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.560]   but I think you'd be fine just to do it in your own name.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:27.560]   And save the simplicity of any corporate formalities of what you're describing.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   If you were looking, what I would say is though that you shouldn't ignore
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   kind of almost in a way analogous to what I was just talking about.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   You shouldn't ignore those consulting services that you might have.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   And you possibly shouldn't ignore having your own active business
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   that's associated with this.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   And I would say that you have the expertise required to take a worn out piece of land,
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.560]   terraform it in some way, bring more water onto the property,
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   plant the right type of habitat and cover for the ducks,
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.560]   and make it much more attractive.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   Well, that's something that can be sold at multiple levels.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   So that can be sold at an information package level.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   That can be sold at a consultant level.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.560]   That can be sold at a contractor level.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.560]   And that can be sold at the level of the land.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.560]   I don't know what your personal capacity would be to do all those things
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   and keep your job.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   But it would seem to me that there's no, if that's a real interest and desire,
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   I wouldn't automatically go for the long slow plan
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   before I would implement some of these other things.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   And I don't know anything about your competition.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   I don't even know anything about consultants who are out there doing that.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   But I would think that that would be something that you could press forward
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   on all levels and that you could probably do it beyond
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.560]   Arkansas specifically.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   And you would in so doing, meaning that in creating consulting work,
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.560]   in creating a YouTube channel, explaining how to do it,
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.560]   and becoming a designer and doing designs for people,
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   I think that that's something that, again, probably has broad application
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   beyond just doing it on land that you own.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   And you would make income from that if there's a market for those services
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.560]   from before your own land.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   And that's something that I would think about.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.560]   as well as a business.

[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   as well as a business.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   as well as a business.

[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   as well as a business.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.560]   as well as a business.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.560]   as well as a business.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   as well as a business.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.560]   And I think that's something that I would think about
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.560]   as well as a business.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.520]   I would say no.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.340]   The gift is made at the time that the 529 account is created and funded.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.340]   Okay.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.340]   Okay.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:01:01.860]   And to be clear, there's no gift tax implications here from the perspective of current tax.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.700]   So we're not getting into gift taxing rules.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.580]   We're just saying that the money is no longer...
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.720]   If the money is in the 529 account and it's in the name of grandchild A, and then the
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.520]   person changes to grandchild B, there's nothing that affects the estate.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.760]   There's nothing that affects the estate tax planning of the wealthy individual.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   Okay.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760]   All right.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Yeah, that is what I was curious of.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:30.760]   And in this case, it's basically there's someone that made a gift for college education.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.560]   Most of it was used, some of it was not.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:41.480]   And when the next generation comes, if that account is kept alive, right, that it needed
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   to be 15 years.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   Right.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.480]   That it was open to the public.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.720]   That it was open for, and money has already been seeded, right?
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   Right.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.060]   Changing that over to another beneficiary and being able to basically start a Roth IRA
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.380]   for basically a newborn.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:59.720]   That was, as you mentioned, it was like, "Hey, this is something we need to look into."
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.720]   It really is a great option for that.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720]   Right.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   Follow-up question, Scott.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   Is there any sort of limit or restriction on how often that beneficiary can change?
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   I don't-
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:25.860]   For example, if there were multiple great-grandchildren, would they be able to make multiple changes
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:31.960]   and rollovers from that account in the same year?
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:41.000]   I don't remember the answer to that question, and I don't think it matters, meaning that
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   I think...
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.240]   I can't see why it would matter.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.880]   In any kind of normal situation, I can't see why the answer to that question would
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.200]   matter.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.000]   If somebody has a 529 account and they have a grandchild, they would go ahead and establish
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.040]   the grandchild as a beneficiary.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.520]   And then if three years later, the grandchild is doing drugs and they don't want to...
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.540]   They realize this grandchild is killing himself, he's never going to college, they would transfer...
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.080]   They would make the grandchild be the beneficiary.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   But I can't...
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.000]   I don't understand why it wouldn't matter.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   I mean, it's a little bit of both.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   For the specific example, there's multiple grandchildren that they want to basically
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   move, be able to contribute money to, have them start a Roth IRA account, then knowing
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   that each of those grandchildren is going to be a beneficiary, they're going to be able
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   to move to a different account.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   account.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   account.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   account.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   account.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   account.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   account.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   account.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   account.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   account.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   account.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   account.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   account.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   account.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   account.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   account.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   account.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   account.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   account.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   account.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   account.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   And then if they're not making any changes, they're going to be able to move to a different
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   account.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:06.920]   So I'm not aware of any rule or restriction that would say how often you can change the
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.760]   beneficiary of a 529 plan.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.920]   As always, I don't have a perfect memory of this stuff, and the IRS code is enormous,
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:22.000]   but I'm not aware of any legal restriction on how often you can change a beneficiary.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.260]   So I would not be concerned about that.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.980]   The restriction is on who can be the beneficiary based upon those IRS rules.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:32.320]   And as we've discussed, those are quite broad.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:39.040]   And the other question would just be, fundamentally, does my plan provider or my custodian have
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.020]   some kind of restriction that I need to be aware of that I can't break?
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.880]   Then that would be something that I would think about.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.360]   But beyond that, I'm not aware of any restriction.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.220]   And so I would say just change as many times you need to accomplish your goals.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.220]   Right.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.220]   Okay.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.220]   Okay.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.720]   I'm not trying to be vague or evasive.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.740]   It's just that that's a very detailed question.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:08.620]   And so since I don't yet understand why it matters, I would need to lay out the family
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:14.800]   tree, the chart, and then understand why that question would matter to give any more insight.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.880]   So I'm not aware of any rule of law that would say you can't change it as many times as you
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.880]   want.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.400]   And so I would just say, yeah, you can change as many times as you want.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.140]   So go on that basis.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.140]   Right.
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.940]   And it was more so just something that I was just saying.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:35.120]   I hadn't read or seen anything about a limit on how many times that beneficiaries change.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:44.040]   And because of this apparent new change, there's some extra benefits to obtain if you can change
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.860]   it multiple times within a certain year.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.860]   Right.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   Okay.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   That's all.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.860]   I don't feel like I've done a very good job, but I've done my best.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.860]   Anything else?
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.860]   No.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.820]   That was the main question.
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   So thank you.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.820]   So I guess I'm going to wrap up here.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.940]   So I guess if I were just to add a summary statement to it for the benefit of listeners
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:08.760]   that I think these new rules that I talked about of the conversion of 529 accounts to
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.940]   Roth IRAs make 529 accounts even more attractive than they were.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:20.260]   529 accounts have always been attractive, not perfect, but always been attractive, especially
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.260]   for wealthy people.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:26.820]   And these rules make them even more attractive.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.700]   And because 529 accounts...
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:34.560]   ...are now so flexible, you can basically build them as a dynasty 529 account for the
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.560]   whole family.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.040]   And they're infinitely cheaper to manage than setting...
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.180]   And more flexible, as long as we're okay with the rules that are on them, than going and
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:48.780]   setting up some kind of family trust that we then have to retain professional management
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.340]   for and trustees, et cetera.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:54.800]   529 accounts are simple, and I think they're a really wonderful tool for wealthy families
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.580]   who want to make sure that there's a giant amount of money that's available for schools,
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:03.080]   for private school, for K through 12, for homeschooling, for college with huge amounts
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.300]   of money.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:09.520]   And then this ability then to go ahead and move the funds to a Roth IRA makes them even
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.880]   more attractive.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.860]   So I think there's a great rule and will serve a lot of wealthy people.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.400]   We go to the state of Colorado.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.820]   Sorry, we were in California.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.440]   Colorado, how can I serve you today?
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.440]   Welcome to the show.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.820]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:25.960]   Just a quick question.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.460]   I'm curious what you're using for water filtering.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.460]   I'm curious what you're using for water filtration these days, if you guys are still using a
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.460]   Berkey or something else.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:40.840]   So at the moment, I don't have a water filtration system at the moment.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.680]   So that's not a good thing.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.520]   I have purification system in an emergency, but at the moment, we're just drinking straight
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520]   tap water.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.940]   I laugh because just this week, I have been working on getting the components together
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:56.980]   to install a system in my house because I don't want to just be drinking straight tap
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.340]   water.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.340]   I don't want to just be drinking straight tap water.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.340]   I don't want to just be drinking straight tap water.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.340]   I don't want to just be drinking straight tap water.
