[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.280]   My name is Joshua Sheets. I am your host.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.000]   Today on the show, I want to answer a listener question.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.040]   Corey writes in and says,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:57.840]   Joshua, what are your predictions about the future developments or changes in filial responsibility laws, considering the aging population and changing family structures?
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.740]   Also, do you have anything?
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.360]   I have two thoughts about how to consider planning for siblings, relatives, or parents who may need additional help in old age.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.500]   Well, these are two questions.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.360]   My answer to question number one will be rather limited.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360]   My answer to question two will be more expansive.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.620]   The first question is, what are your predictions about the future developments or changes in filial responsibility laws?
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.440]   Short version is, I don't have any predictions.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.000]   I don't know very much about them.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's my understanding that filial responsibility...
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.640]   Filial responsibility laws are laws that exist in something like half of the United States.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.000]   I don't know about international...
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   You know, what international...
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   How many countries around the world have these kinds of laws?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.920]   But a filial responsibility law is a law that requires, using the power of the court, requires children, especially children with resources, to care for parents or other family members,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   if those other family members are destitute.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.220]   If those other family members are destitute, don't have the money to care for themselves, so they don't become a burden on the state.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.740]   And that's about as far as my knowledge goes.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.920]   These laws do exist.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:20.200]   What is unclear to me is basically how widely enforced these kinds of laws are and what the practical impact of them is.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.020]   In my own home state of Florida, these laws do not exist.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.440]   And I just don't know how widely used they are.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.760]   And I just don't know how widely used they are in the United States.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.900]   And I just don't know how widely used they are in the United States.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:57.880]   And I just don't know how widely used they are in the United States.

[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:26.740]   And I just don't know how widely used they are in the United States.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:26.760]   And I just don't know how widely used they are in the United States.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:26.780]  .
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:26.780]  .
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.940]   There's much more that could be said, but I think these are the most important things
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.980]   to be said.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.840]   The specifics of where are we going to live, how are we going to work out the bills, who's
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:44.140]   going to take care of parents, family schedules, nurses, no nurses, housing, rooms, et cetera.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:49.740]   Those are up to each individual situation to find something that's appropriate.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.900]   I am glad to know that, or at least a few years ago, I read an article that said a big
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:39:01.760]   trend in new housing development is to develop housing that incorporates living space for
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.780]   multiple members of the family in it.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.620]   I think that's great.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.900]   And I really appreciate how I think that this is, I really admire cultures where this is
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.920]   culturally expected.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:18.600]   I think a lot of times the cultural expectations, especially on Asians and Latin people, et
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.400]   cetera, is often high, and that comes with its own problems.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:29.700]   But I admire so much that it's so common in Asian households to have multi-generational
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.160]   families.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.760]   And to me, as long as we can deal with the boundary stuff appropriately and healthily,
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.540]   that just seems such a wonderful trend to me.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.440]   And I'm glad the housing and whatnot is reflecting on that.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:47.140]   But to me, though, at its core, if we just focus on improving relationships and enhancing
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:52.600]   communication in those relationships, and then building as much shared vision,
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:59.560]   and common purpose as is possible, and to emphasize, we're not all going to go out
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:04.100]   and change the world together and be solving poverty in Africa together.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.720]   That's not a realistic goal.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:12.840]   But building a shared vision of what we want the next decade to look like and working together
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:18.980]   to the degree that is possible, given our individual unique perspectives on the world,
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.640]   that will enhance it.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.120]   And if you want to do that, then you have to do it.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:28.280]   If you want to do something to help the planning opportunities for siblings, relatives, or
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:34.040]   parents who may need additional help in old age, focus on relationship and communication.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:40.680]   Because in the context of good relationships and strong communication, details will be
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.060]   easy.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:50.880]   Without good relationships, the best possible, and strong communication skills, then all
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.900]   those specific decisions will be difficult.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:52.020]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:52.080]   And I think that's a really important point.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.100]   And I think that's a really important point.
