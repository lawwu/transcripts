[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220]   St. Swithin's College, Nottingham University, Newark-on-Trent, Nottingham, October 21, 1934.
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.360]   Professor Franklin Caldwell, care of British Scientific Expedition, Hilla, Mesopotamia.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.420]   My dear professor, the five clay tablets from your recent excavation in the ruins of Babylon
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.420]   arrived on the same boat with your letter. I have been fascinated no end and have spent many
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.480]   pleasant hours translating their inscriptions. I should have answered your letter at once,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.680]   but delayed until I could complete the translations, which are attached.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.060]   The tablets arrived without damage thanks to your careful use of preservatives and
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.980]   excellent packing. You will be as astonished as we in the laboratory at the story they relate.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.140]   One expects the dim and distant past to speak of romance and adventure,
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.340]   Arabian Nights sort of things, you know. When instead it discloses the problem of a person
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.360]   named Dabasir to pay off his debts, one realizes that conditions upon this old world have not
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.220]   changed as much.
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.660]   In five thousand years, as one might expect. It's odd, you know, but these old inscriptions rather
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.020]   rag me, as the students say. Being a college professor, I'm supposed to be a thinking human
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.100]   being, possessing a working knowledge of most subjects. Yet here comes this old chap out of
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.240]   the dust-covered ruins of Babylon to offer a way I had never heard of, to pay off my debts and at
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.740]   the same time acquire gold to jingle in my wallet. Pleasant thought, I say, and interesting to prove
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.860]   whether it will work as well nowadays. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that, but I'm sure I will.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.200]   I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that, but I'm sure I will. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that,
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.000]   as did in old Babylon. Mrs. Shrewsbury and myself are planning to try out his plan upon our own
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.440]   affairs, which could be much improved. Wishing you the best of luck in your worthy undertaking,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.180]   and waiting eagerly another opportunity to assist, I am yours sincerely.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.580]   Alfred H. Shrewsbury, Department of Archaeology.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.120]   Tablet number one.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.840]   Now when the moon becometh full, I, Dabasir, who am but recently returned from slavery in Syria,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.320]   with the determination to pay my many just debts and become a man of means worthy of respect in my
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.960]   native city of Babylon, do here engrave upon the clay a permanent record of my affairs to guide
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.540]   and assist me in carrying through my high desires. Under the wise advice of my good friend Mathon,
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.440]   the gold lender, I am determined to follow an exact plan that he doth say will lead any
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.920]   honorable man out of debt into means and self-respect. This plan includeth three purposes,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.240]   which are my hope and desire. First, the plan doth provide for my future prosperity. Therefore,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.200]   one-tenth of all I earn shall be set aside as my own to keep, for Mathon speaketh wisely when he
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.900]   saith, That man who keepeth in his purse both gold and silver that he need not spend is good
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.880]   to his family, and loyal to his king. The man who hath but a few coppers in his purse
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.980]   is indifferent to his family, and indifferent to his king.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.800]   But the man who hath not in his purse is unkind to his family, and is disloyal to his king,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.780]   for his own heart is bitter. Therefore the man who wisheth to achieve must have coin that he may
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.160]   keep to jingle in his purse, that he have in his heart love for his family, and loyalty to his king.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.400]   Second, the plan doth provide that I shall support and clothe my good wife,
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.120]   who hath returned to me with loyalty from the house of her father,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.340]   for Mathon doth say that to take good care of a faithful wife putteth self-respect into the heart
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.680]   of a man, and addeth strength and determination to his purposes. Therefore, seven-tenths of all
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.480]   I earn shall be used to provide a home, clothes to wear, and food to eat, with a bit extra to spend,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.840]   that our lives be not lacking in pleasure and enjoyment. But he doth further enjoin the greatest
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.980]   care, that we spend not greater than seven-tenths of what I earn for these worthy purposes.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.240]   Herein lieth the success of the plan. I must live upon this portion, and never use more,
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.200]   nor buy what I may not pay for out of this portion.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:12.140]   Tablet number two. Third, the plan doth provide that out of my earnings my debts shall be paid.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.500]   Therefore each time the moon is full, two-tenths of all I have earned shall be divided honorably
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.580]   and fairly among those who have trusted me, and to whom I am indebted. Thus in due time,
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.620]   I shall be able to pay for my debts, and my debts shall be paid. Therefore each time the moon is full,
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.940]   will all my indebtedness be surely paid. Therefore do I here engrave the name of every man to whom I
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.440]   am indebted, and the honest amount of my debt. Faroo, the cloth weaver, two silver, six copper.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.440]   Sinjar, the couch maker, one silver. Amar, my friend, three silver, one copper. Zankar, my friend,
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.060]   four silver, seven copper. Askamir, my friend, one silver, three copper. Haransir, the jewel maker,
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.600]   six silver, one copper. Amar, my friend, three silver, one copper. Zankar, my friend,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.960]   two silver, two copper. Diyarbekir, my father's friend, four silver, one copper. Alkahad, the
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.280]   house owner, fourteen silver. Mathon, the gold lender, nine silver. Birajik, the farmer, one
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.600]   silver, seven copper. From here on, disintegrated, cannot be deciphered. Tablet number three.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:23.580]   To these creditors do I owe in total one hundred and nineteen pieces of silver and one hundred and
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.580]   twenty-two. I owe these sums and saw no way to repay. In my folly I did permit my wife to return
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.520]   to her father, and didst leave my native city and seek easy wealth elsewhere, only to find disaster
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.560]   and to see myself sold into the degradation of slavery. Now that Mathon doth show me how I can
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.320]   repay my debts in small sums of my earnings, do I realize the great extent of my folly in running
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.500]   away from the results of my extravagances. Therefore have I visited my creditors and explained to them
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.560]   that I have no reason to repay my debts. I have no reason to repay my debts. I have no reason to
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.620]   pay my debts. I have no reason to repay my debts. I have no reason to repay my debts. I have no reason
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.680]   to repay my debts. I have no reason to repay my debts. I have no reason to repay my debts. I have no
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.400]   with which to pay except my ability to earn, and that I intend to apply two-tenths of all I earn
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.080]   upon my indebtedness evenly and honestly. This much can I pay, but no more. Therefore, if they
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.360]   be patient, in time my obligations will be paid in full. Ahmar, whom I thought my best friend,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.020]   reviled me bitterly, and I left him in humiliation. Birajik, the farmer, pleaded that I pay him first,
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.540]   as he didst badly need help. Al-Kahad, the housekeeper, said,
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.940]   was indeed disagreeable, and insisted that he would make me trouble unless I didst soon settle
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.580]   in full with him. All the rest willingly accepted my proposal. Therefore, am I more determined than
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.740]   ever to carry through, being convinced that it is easier to pay one's just debts than to avoid them.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.220]   Even though I cannot meet the needs and demands of a few of my creditors,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:53.440]   I will deal impartially with all. Tablet number four. Again the moon shines full,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.960]   I have worked hard with a free mind. My good wife hath supported my intentions to pay my creditors.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.480]   Because of our wise determination, I have earned during the past moon,
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.340]   buying camels of sound wind and good legs, for Nebatur, the sum of nineteen pieces of silver.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.120]   This I have divided according to the plan. One-tenth have I set aside to keep as my own.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.460]   Seven-tenths have I divided with my good wife to pay for our living. Two-tenths have I divided
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.180]   among my creditors, as evenly as could be done in coppers. I did not see Ahmar,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.460]   but left it with his wife. Birajik was so pleased he would kiss my hand.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.260]   Old Alkahad alone was grouchy, and said I must pay faster. To which I replied that if I were
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.500]   permitted to be well fed and not worried, that alone would enable me to pay faster.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.480]   All the others thanked me and spoke well of my efforts. Therefore, at the end of one moon,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.500]   my indebtedness is reduced by almost four pieces of silver, and I possess almost two pieces of
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.860]   silver besides, upon which no man hath claim. My heart is lighter than it hath been for a long time.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:59.140]   Again the moon shines full. I have worked hard, but with poor success.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.120]   Few camels have I been able to buy. Only eleven pieces of silver have I earned.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.400]   Nevertheless, my good wife and I have stood by the plan, even though we have bought no new raiment
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.880]   and eaten little but herbs. Again I paid ourselves one-tenth of the eleven pieces,
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.700]   while we lived upon seven-tenths. I was surprised when Ahmar commended my payment,
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.300]   even though small. So did Birajik.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.040]   Flew into a rage, but when told to give back his portion if he did not wish it, he became
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.140]   reconciled. The others, as before, were content.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:39.780]   Again the moon shines full, and I am greatly rejoiced. I intercepted a fine herd of camels,
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.040]   and bought many sound ones. Therefore my earnings were forty-two pieces of silver.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.580]   This moon my wife and myself have bought much-needed sandals and raiment.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.440]   Also we have dined well on meat and fowl. More than eight pieces of silver have I earned.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.100]   We have paid to our creditors. Even Al-Kahad did not protest.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.600]   Great is the plan, for it leadeth us out of debt and giveth us wealth, which is ours to keep.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.920]   Three times the moon had been full, since I last carved upon this clay.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.540]   Each time I paid to myself one-tenth of all I earned.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.400]   Each time my good wife and I have lived upon seven-tenths, even though at times it was difficult.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.760]   Each time have I paid to my creditors two-tenths.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.360]   In my purse I now have twenty-one pieces of silver that are mine.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.420]   It maketh my life a great pleasure.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.460]   It maketh my head to stand straight upon my shoulders, and maketh me proud to walk among my friends.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.740]   My wife keepeth well our home, and it is becomingly gowned.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.400]   We are happy to live together.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.840]   The plan is of untold value.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.380]   Hath it not made an honorable man of an ex-slave?
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.440]   Tablet number five.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:48.000]   Again the moon shines full, and I remember that it is long since I carved upon the clay.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.820]   Twelve moons in truth have come and gone.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.400]   But this day I will not neglect my rights.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.100]   I will not forget the record, because upon this day I have paid the last of my debts.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.620]   This is the day upon which my good wife and my thankful self celebrate with great feasting,
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.240]   that our determination hath been achieved.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.380]   Many things occurred upon my final visit to my creditors that I shall long remember.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.720]   Ahmar begged my forgiveness for his unkind words,
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.380]   and said that I was one of all others he most desired for a friend.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.020]   Old Al-Kahad is not so bad after all, for he said,
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.380]   Thou wert once a piece of soft wood,
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.600]   and thou wert once a piece of soft clay to be pressed and molded by any hand that touched thee.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.500]   But now thou art a piece of bronze capable of holding an edge.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.320]   If thou needest silver or gold at any time, come to me.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.940]   Nor is he the only one who holdeth me in high regard.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.840]   Many others speak deferentially to me.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:46.200]   My good wife looketh upon me with a light in her eyes that doth make a man have confidence in himself.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.180]   Yet it is the plan that hath made my success.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.580]   It hath enabled me to pay all my debts,
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.280]   and to jingle both gold and silver,
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:53.940]   in my purse.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.760]   I do commend it to all who wish to get ahead.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.920]   For truly, if it will enable an ex-slave to pay his debts,
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.980]   and have gold in his purse,
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.920]   will it not aid any man to find independence?
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.520]   Nor am I myself finished with it,
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.580]   for I am convinced that if I follow it further,
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.020]   it will make me rich among men.

[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.740]   Newark-on-Trent, Nottingham, November 7, 1936.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.560]   Professor Franklin Caldwell,
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.340]   Care of British Science,
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.300]   Scientific Expedition,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.940]   Hilla, Mesopotamia.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.580]   My dear professor,
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.560]   if in your further digging into those ruins of Babylon
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.580]   you encounter the ghost of a former resident,
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.020]   an old camel trader named Dabasir,
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.740]   do me a favor.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.480]   Tell him that his scribbling upon those clay tablets so long ago
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.800]   has earned for him the lifelong gratitude of a couple of college folks back here in England.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.620]   You will possibly remember my writing a year ago
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.580]   that Mrs. Shrewsbury and myself intended to try his plan for getting out of debt,
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.920]   and at the same time having gold to jingle.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.040]   You may have guessed, even though we tried to keep it from our friends,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.940]   our desperate straits.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.720]   We were frightfully humiliated for years by a lot of old debts,
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.360]   and worried sick for fear some of the tradespeople might start a scandal
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.760]   that would force me out of the college.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.360]   We paid and paid every shilling we could squeeze out of income,
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   but it was hardly enough to hold things even.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.340]   Besides, we were forced to do all our buying
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.900]   where we could get further credit regardless of higher costs.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.620]   It developed into one of those vicious circles that grow worse instead of better.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.580]   Our struggles were getting hopeless.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.920]   We could not move to less costly rooms because we owed the landlord.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.280]   There did not appear to be anything we could do to improve our situation.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.120]   Then, here comes your acquaintance,
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.900]   the old camel trader from Babylon,
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.820]   with a plan to do just what we wished to accomplish.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.620]   He jolly well stirred us up to follow his system.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.360]   We made a list of all our debts,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.660]   and I took it around and showed it to everyone we owed.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.180]   I explained how it was simply impossible for me to ever pay them
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.380]   the way things were going along.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.180]   They could readily see this themselves from the figures.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.680]   Then I explained that the only way I saw to pay in full
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   was to set aside 20% of my income each month to be divided pro rata,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.260]   which would pay them in full in a little over two years.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.620]   That, in the meantime, we would go on a cash basis
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.960]   and give them the further benefit of our cash purchases.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.280]   They were really quite decent.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.800]   Our green grocer, a wise old chap,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.860]   put it in a way that helped to bring around the rest.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.060]   If you pay for all you buy and then pay some on what you owe,
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.340]   that is better than you have done
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.840]   for you ain't paid down the account none in three years.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.800]   Finally, I secured all their names to an agreement
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.360]   binding them not to molest us
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.100]   as long as the 20% of income was paid regularly.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.740]   Then we began scheming on how to live upon 70%.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.640]   We were determined to keep that extra 10% to jingle.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.720]   The thought of silver and possibly gold was most alluring.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.560]   It was like having an adventure to make the change.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.640]   We enjoyed figuring this way and that
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.620]   to live comfortably upon that remaining 70%.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.600]   We started with rent and managed to secure a fair reduction.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.840]   Next, we put our favorite brands of tea and such under suspicion
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.480]   and were agreeably surprised how often
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.820]   we could purchase superior qualities at less cost.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.240]   It is too long a story for a letter,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.300]   but anyhow, it did not prove difficult.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.880]   We managed and write cheerfully at that.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.100]   What a relief it proved to have our affairs in such a shape
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.280]   we were no longer persecuted by past due accounts.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.640]   I must not neglect, however, to tell you
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.820]   about that extra 10% we were supposed to jingle.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.380]   Well, we did jingle it for some time.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.700]   Now, don't laugh too soon.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.460]   You see, that is the sporty part.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.080]   It is the real fun to start accumulating money
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.660]   that you do not want to spend.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.140]   There is more pleasure in running up such a surplus
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.620]   than there could be in spending it.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.900]   After we had jingled to our heart's content,
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.860]   we found a more profitable use for it.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.420]   We took up an investment upon which we could pay
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.060]   that 10% each month.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.440]   This is proving to be the most satisfying part
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.500]   of our regeneration.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.980]   It is the first thing we pay out of my check.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.200]   There is a most gratifying sense of security
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   to know our interests are not just our money.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.480]   Our investment is growing steadily.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.680]   By the time my teaching days are over,
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.480]   it should be a snug sum,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.700]   large enough so the income will take care of us
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.280]   from then on.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.760]   All this out of my same old check.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.360]   Difficult to believe, yet absolutely true.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.660]   All our debts being gradually paid
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.600]   and at the same time our investment increasing.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.680]   Besides, we get along financially
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.620]   even better than before.
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.680]   Who would believe there could be such a difference
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.860]   in results between following a financial plan
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.380]   and just drifting along?
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.280]   At the end of the next year,
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.180]   when all our old bills shall have been
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.740]   paid, we will have more to pay upon our investment
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.400]   besides some extra for travel.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.280]   We are determined never again
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.980]   to permit our living expenses to exceed
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.280]   70% of our income.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.260]   Now you can understand why we would like to extend
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.180]   our personal thanks to that old chap
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.520]   whose plan saved us from our hell on earth.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.560]   He knew.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.060]   He had been through it all.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.180]   He wanted others to benefit from his own bitter experiences.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.340]   That is why
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.200]   he spent tedious hours carving
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.460]   his message upon the clay.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.860]   He had a real message for fellow sufferers.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.860]   A message so important that after 5,000 years
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.860]   it has risen out of the ruins of Babylon
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.860]   just as true and just as vital as the day it was buried.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.860]   Yours sincerely,
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.860]   Alfred H. Shrewsbury, Department of Archaeology.
