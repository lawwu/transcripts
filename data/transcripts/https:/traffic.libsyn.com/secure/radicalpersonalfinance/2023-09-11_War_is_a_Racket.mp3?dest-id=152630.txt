[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.460]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.480]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.740]   insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.220]   and meaningful life now while building a plan
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.120]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.480]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.180]   I am your host.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.120]   And today on the show, I want to talk with you
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.880]   about one of those big picture financial topics.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.800]   It's not about personal finance.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.120]   It is, however, about how the world works.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.820]   And I think it's important that you and I pay attention
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.560]   to these things when they come across our desks.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.640]   I watched today on Twitter, I watched a comment
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.060]   from Senator McConnell and the United States Senator,
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.040]   that comment that he made here on Twitter.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.600]   I want to read it to you.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.900]   Published September 7, 2023 at 1044 a.m.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.360]   from Leader McConnell and the United States Senate.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.580]   Quote, standing with our allies against Russian aggression
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.220]   isn't charity.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.860]   In fact, it's a direct investment in replenishing
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.540]   America's arsenal with America's money.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.060]   It's American weapons built by American workers.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.980]   Expanding our defense industrial base puts America
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.520]   in a stronger position to out-compete China.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.460]   Now, this particular Twitter comment to me is rather shocking
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.160]   because it seems like a textbook example
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.600]   of what we sometimes refer to as saying the quiet part out loud.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.880]   And I thought, you know, there is a very important essay
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.520]   that I have thought about for many years.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.840]   Read many years ago.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.740]   Probably reread it at least every couple years or so.
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.240]   I've talked about it on the show, but I've never read to you.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.460]   And I believe this is one of the more useful essays
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.380]   for you to have in the back of your mind.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.860]   You see, current events are hard to parse through.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.200]   They're confusing, hard to figure out, et cetera.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.160]   But sometimes you can look back at history
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.100]   and by seeing what has happened in history,
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.420]   you can understand your present day a little bit more clearly.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.360]   The essay,
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.260]   I want to read you,
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.500]   is called War is a Racket.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.940]   This is a fairly well-known essay
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.800]   by Major General Smedley Butler,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.080]   a long-ago retired United States Marine Corps Major General.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.260]   And what is interesting about General Butler,
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.180]   Major General Butler,
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.660]   is that he is one of those men
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.420]   who was incredibly decorated,
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.420]   very highly placed in the overall military.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.460]   Reading from his Wikipedia entry,
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.600]   Major General Smedley Darlington Butler,
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.700]   July 30, 1881 to June 21, 1940,
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.200]   nicknamed the Maverick Marine,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.540]   was a senior United States Marine Corps officer.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.520]   During his 34-year career,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.040]   he fought in the Philippine-American War,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.100]   the Boxer Rebellion,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.160]   the Mexican Revolution,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.660]   and World War I.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.300]   At the time of his death,
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.260]   Butler was the most decorated Marine in U.S. history.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.460]   By the end of his career,
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.460]   sorry, I repeat that in case you missed it.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.740]   At the time of his death,
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.760]   Butler was the most decorated Marine in U.S. history.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.160]   By the end of his career,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.260]   Butler had received 16 medals,
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.460]   including five for heroism.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.580]   He is the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal,
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.800]   as well as two Medals of Honor,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.740]   all for separate actions.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.060]   In 1993,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.580]   excuse me, 1933,
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.740]   I'll skip the other controversies,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.920]   Butler's,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.760]   after Butler retired from the military,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.020]   he became well-known for giving a speech
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.600]   and for a pamphlet that he wrote called
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.260]   War is a Racket.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.820]   It's a speech in a 1935 short book
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.860]   that he wrote and published.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.420]   It talks about what war is.
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.160]   And without further ado,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.920]   let me just read this to you
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.860]   so that you understand.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.600]   And I want you to have Leader McConnell's
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.200]   tweet in the back of your mind.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.480]   As I read this to you.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.020]   Chapter one,
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.340]   war is a racket.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.300]   War is a racket.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.880]   It always has been.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.060]   It is possibly the oldest,
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.100]   easily the most profitable,
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.780]   surely the most vicious.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.260]   It is the only one international in scope.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.640]   It is the only one in which the profits
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.880]   are reckoned in dollars
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.580]   and the losses in lives.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.400]   A racket is,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.460]   it is best described,
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.000]   I believe,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.560]   as something that is not what it seems
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.980]   to the majority of the people.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.680]   Only a small inside group
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.340]   knows what it is about.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.180]   It is conducted for the benefit
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.600]   of the very few
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.340]   at the expense of the very many.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.900]   Out of war,
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.300]   a few people make huge fortunes.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.360]   In the world war,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.040]   meaning, of course,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.860]   World War I,
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.860]   in the world war,
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.100]   a mere handful garnered
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.360]   the profits of the conflict.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   At least 21,000 new millionaires
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   and billionaires
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.380]   and billionaires
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.240]   were made in the United States
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.520]   during the world war.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.420]   That many admitted their huge blood games
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.520]   in their income tax returns.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.720]   How many other war millionaires
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.280]   falsified their tax returns?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.200]   No one knows.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.380]   How many of these war millionaires
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.020]   shouldered a rifle?
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.540]   How many of them dug a trench?
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.020]   How many of them knew
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.400]   what it meant to go hungry
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.000]   in a rat-infested dugout?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.240]   How many of them spent sleepless,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.180]   frightened nights
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.160]   ducking shells and shrapnel
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.780]   and machine gun bullets?
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.640]   How many of them parried
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.100]   a bayonet thrust of an enemy?
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.200]   How many of them were wounded
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.080]   or killed in battle?
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.780]   Out of war,
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.660]   nations acquire additional territory
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.980]   if they are victorious.
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.240]   They just take it.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.320]   This newly acquired territory
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.360]   promptly is exploited by the few,
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.100]   the selfsame few who wrung dollars
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.700]   out of blood in the war.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.280]   The general public shoulders the bill.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   And what is this bill?
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.400]   This bill renders a horrible accounting.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.020]   Newly placed gravestones,
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.940]   mangled bodies,
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.960]   shattered minds,
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.880]   broken hearts and homes,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.340]   economic instability,
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.880]   depression and all its attendant miseries,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.980]   back-breaking taxation
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.900]   for generations and generations.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.180]   For a great many years as a soldier,
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.700]   I had a suspicion that war was a racket.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.540]   Not until I retired to civil life
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.960]   did I fully realize it.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.780]   Now that I see the international war clouds
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.300]   gathering as they are today,
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.580]   I must face it and speak out.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.060]   Again, they are choosing sides.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.860]   France and Russia met
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.260]   and agreed to stand side by side.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.940]   Italy and Austria hurried
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.180]   to make a similar agreement.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.420]   Poland and Germany cast sheep's eyes
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.100]   at each other,
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.700]   forgetting for the nonce,
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.120]   meaning one unique occasion,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.960]   their dispute over the Polish corridor.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.780]   The assassination of King Alexander
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.300]   of Yugoslavia,
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.820]   complicated matters.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.540]   Yugoslavia and Hungary,
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.840]   long bitter enemies,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.380]   were almost at each other's throats.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.220]   Italy was ready to jump in,
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.040]   but France was waiting.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.100]   So was Czechoslovakia.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.980]   All of them are looking ahead to war.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.400]   Not the people,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.580]   not those who fight and pay and die,
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.560]   only those who foment wars
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.040]   and remain safely at home to profit.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.260]   There are 40 million men under arms
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.040]   in the world today,
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.280]   and our statesmen
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.720]   and diplomats have the temerity
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.800]   to say that war is not
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.240]   in the making.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.560]   Hell's bells.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.880]   Are these 40 million men
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.400]   being trained to be dancers?
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.060]   Not in Italy, to be sure.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.940]   Premier Mussolini knows
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.200]   what they are being trained for.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.760]   He, at least, is frank enough
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.460]   to speak out.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.140]   Only the other day,
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.700]   Il Duque in International Conciliation,
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.740]   the publication of the Carnegie Endowment
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.980]   for International Peace, said,
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.260]   and above all, fascism,
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.260]   the more it consists
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.680]   and observes the future
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.340]   and the development of humanity,
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.100]   quite apart from political considerations
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.680]   of the moment,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.960]   believes neither in the possibility
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.980]   nor the utility of perpetual peace.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.520]   War alone brings up to its highest tension
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.760]   all human energy
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.940]   and puts the stamp of nobility
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.760]   upon the people who have the courage
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.460]   to meet it.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.260]   Undoubtedly, Mussolini means exactly what he says.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.080]   His well-trained army,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.260]   his great fleet of planes,
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.240]   and even his navy are ready for war.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.700]   Anxious for it, apparently.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.820]   His recent stand at the side of Hungary
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.720]   in the latter's dispute with Yugoslavia
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.340]   showed that,
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.600]   and the hurried mobilization of his troops
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.720]   on the Austrian border
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.900]   after the assassination of Dolfus
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.640]   showed it too.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.020]   There are others in Europe too
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.920]   whose saber-rattling presages war
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   sooner or later.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.380]   Herr Hitler, with his rearming Germany
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.220]   and his constant demands
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.480]   for more and more arms,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.220]   is an equal, if not greater,
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.420]   menace to peace.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.660]   France only recently increased
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.120]   the term of military service
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.960]   for its youth from a year to 18 months.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.740]   Yes, all over.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.360]   Nations are camping in their arms.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.000]   The mad dogs of Europe are on the loose.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.260]   In the Orient,
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.740]   the maneuvering is more adroit.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.900]   Back in 1904,
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.480]   when Russia and Japan fought,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.280]   we kicked out our old friends,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.760]   the Russians, and backed Japan.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.200]   Then our very generous international friends
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.020]   were financing Japan.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.300]   Now the trend is to poison us
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.120]   against the Japanese.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.040]   What does the open-door policy
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.280]   to China mean to us?
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.680]   Our trade with China is about $90 million a year.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.140]   Or the Philippine Islands.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.180]   We've spent about $600 million
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.280]   in the Philippines in 35 years.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.200]   And we, our bankers
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.040]   and industrialists and speculators,
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.080]   have private investments there
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.040]   of less than $200 million.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.540]   Then, to save that China trade
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.180]   of about $200 million,
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.000]   or to protect these private investments
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.520]   of less than $200 million in the Philippines,
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.100]   we would be all stirred up
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.700]   to hate Japan and go to war.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.700]   A war that might well cost us
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.260]   tens of billions of dollars,
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.600]   hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.740]   and many more hundreds of thousands
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.460]   of physically maimed and mentally unbalanced men.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.820]   Of course,
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.720]   for this loss,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.940]   there would be a compensating profit.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.900]   Fortunes would be made.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.700]   Millions and billions of dollars
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.160]   would be pocketed by the Japanese.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.660]   Millions and billions of dollars
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.700]   would be piled up by a few
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.400]   munitions makers,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.460]   bankers,
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.460]   shipbuilders,
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.720]   manufacturers,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.540]   meat packers,
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.340]   speculators.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.640]   They would fare well.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.580]   Yes, they are getting ready
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.340]   for another war.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.900]   Why shouldn't they?
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.100]   It pays high dividends.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.540]   But what does it profit
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.640]   the men who are killed?
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.100]   What does it profit
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.640]   their mothers and sisters,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.100]   their wives and their sweethearts?
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.380]   What does it profit
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.440]   their children?
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.140]   What does it profit
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.740]   anyone except the very few
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.120]   to whom war means huge profits?
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.280]   Yes.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.380]   And what does it profit
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.640]   the nation?
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.980]   Take our own case.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.580]   Until 1898,
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.380]   we didn't own a bit of territory
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.400]   outside the mainland of North America.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.640]   At that time,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.140]   our national debt was a little more
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:48.840]   than $1 trillion.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.020]   Then we became
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.300]   internationally minded.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.060]   We forgot
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.080]   or shunted aside
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.080]   the advice of the father of our country.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.680]   We forgot George Washington's
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.200]   warning about entangling alliances.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.300]   We went to war.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.880]   We acquired outside territory.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.420]   At the end of the World War period,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.160]   as a direct result of our fiddling
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.320]   in international affairs,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.140]   our national debt had jumped
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.560]   to over $25 trillion.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.540]   Our total favorable trade balance
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.140]   during the 25-year period
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.160]   was about 24...
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.520]   Excuse me.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.440]   I was mistakenly
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.060]   using trillions of dollars.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:29.680]   Instead of billions.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.120]   $24 billion.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.440]   So it should have been $1 billion,
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.380]   $25 billion,
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.480]   and $24 trillion.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.180]   Our total favorable trade balance
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.480]   during the 25-year period
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.260]   was about $24 billion.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.760]   Therefore,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.480]   on a purely bookkeeping basis,
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   we ran a little behind year for year.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.920]   And that foreign trade
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.120]   might well have been ours
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.280]   without the wars.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.220]   It would have been far cheaper,
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.860]   not to say safer,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.080]   for the average American
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.920]   who pays the bills
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.640]   to stay out of foreign entanglements.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.140]   For a very few,
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:58.760]   this racket,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.880]   like bootlegging
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.500]   and other underworld rackets,
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.060]   brings fancy profits.
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.680]   But the cost of operations
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.520]   is always transferred to the people
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.100]   who do not profit.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.300]   Chapter 2.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.340]   Who makes the profits?
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.940]   The World War,
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.800]   rather our brief participation in it,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.340]   has cost the United States
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.020]   some $52 billion.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.880]   Figure it out.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.440]   That means $400
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.100]   to every American man,
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:27.980]   woman, and child.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.860]   And,
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.240]   we haven't paid the debt yet.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.560]   We are paying it.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.900]   Our children will pay it.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.860]   And our children's children
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.940]   probably still
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.440]   will be paying the cost of that war.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.600]   The normal profits
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.660]   of a business concern
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.620]   in the United States
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.080]   are 6, 8, 10,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.680]   and sometimes 12%.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.040]   But wartime profits,
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.300]   that is another matter.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.460]   20, 60, 100, 300,
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.340]   and even 1,800%.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.460]   The sky is the limit.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.760]   All that traffic
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.620]   will bear.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.000]   Uncle Sam has the money.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.740]   Let's get it.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.000]   Of course,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.240]   it isn't put that crudely
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.200]   in wartime.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.340]   It is dressed into speeches
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.180]   about patriotism,
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.400]   love of country,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.700]   and we must all put our shoulders
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.360]   to the wheel.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.220]   But the profits jump
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.420]   and leap and skyrocket
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.760]   and are safely pocketed.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.160]   Let's just take a few examples.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.800]   Take our friends,
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.840]   the DuPonts,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.940]   the powder people.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.540]   Didn't one of them testify
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.240]   before a
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.620]   Senate committee recently
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.200]   that their powder won the war
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.800]   or saved the world
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.520]   for democracy
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.240]   or something?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.420]   How did they do in the war?
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.340]   They were a patriotic corporation.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.240]   Well, the average earnings
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.860]   of the DuPonts
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.920]   for the period 1910 to 1914
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.720]   were $6 million a year.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.460]   It wasn't much,
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.800]   but the DuPonts
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.980]   managed to get along on it.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.740]   Now let's look at their
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.920]   average yearly profit
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.220]   during the war years,
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.780]   1914 to 1918.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.620]   58.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.080]   Million dollars a year profit,
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.620]   we find.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.320]   Nearly 10 times that of normal times,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.100]   and the profits of normal times
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.760]   were pretty good.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.240]   An increase in profits
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.480]   of more than 950%.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   Take one of our little steel companies
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.840]   that patriotically shunted aside
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.960]   the making of rails
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.400]   and girders and bridges
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.320]   to manufacture war materials.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.480]   Well, their 1910 to 1914
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.760]   yearly earnings
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.160]   averaged $6 million.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.840]   Then came the war.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.280]   And like loyal citizens,
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.620]   Bethlehem Steel promptly turned
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.940]   to munitions making.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.900]   Did their profits jump?
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.480]   Or did they let Uncle Sam
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.300]   in for a bargain?
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.620]   Well, their 1914 to 1918 average
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.460]   was $49 million a year.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.520]   Or let's take United States Steel.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.000]   The normal earnings
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.020]   during the five-year period
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.740]   prior to the war
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.560]   were $105 million a year.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.720]   Not bad.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.240]   Then along came the war
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.740]   and the war was over.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.940]   Up went the profits.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.480]   The average yearly profit
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.500]   for the period 1914 to 1918
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.980]   was $240 million.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.300]   Not bad.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.700]   There you have some of the
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.760]   steel and powder earnings.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.800]   Let's look at something else.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.000]   A little copper, perhaps.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.800]   That always does well in war times.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.480]   Anaconda, for instance.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.180]   Average yearly earnings
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.460]   during the pre-war years,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.680]   1910 to 1914,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.820]   of $10 million.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.020]   During the war years,
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.640]   1914 to 1918,
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.020]   profits leaped to $34 million per year.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.940]   Or Utah copper,
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.800]   average of $5 million per year
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.780]   during the 1910 to 1914 period,
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.200]   jumped to an average of $21 million
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.780]   yearly profits for the war period.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.480]   Let's group these five
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.820]   with three smaller companies.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.380]   The total yearly average profits
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.360]   of the pre-war period,
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.620]   1910 to 1914,
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.640]   were $137,480,000.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.000]   Then along came the war.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.820]   The average yearly profits
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.640]   for this group skyrocketed.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.900]   To $408,300,000.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.160]   A little increase in profits
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.340]   of approximately 200%.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.040]   Does war pay?
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.700]   They paid them.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.400]   But they aren't the only ones.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.360]   There are still others.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.680]   Let's take leather.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.940]   For the three-year period
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.520]   before the war,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.280]   the total profits
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.240]   of Central Leather Company
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.800]   were $3.5 million.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.480]   That was approximately
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.380]   $1,167,000 a year.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.400]   Well, in 1916,
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.520]   Central Leather returned
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.320]   a profit of $15 million.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.700]   A small increase of 1,100%.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.760]   That's all.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.700]   The General Chemical Company
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.340]   averaged a profit
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.760]   for the three years before the war
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.640]   of a little over $800,000 a year.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.780]   Came the war
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.600]   and the profits jumped
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.640]   to $12 million.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.880]   A leap of 1,400%.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.260]   International Nickel Company,
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.980]   and you can't have a war
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:49.700]   without nickel,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.440]   showed an increase in profits
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.520]   from a mere average
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.840]   of $4 million a year
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.700]   to $73 million yearly.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.120]   Not bad.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.280]   An increase of more than 1,700%.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.460]   American Sugar Refining Company
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.260]   averaged $2 million a year
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.560]   for the three years before the war.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.780]   In 1916,
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.040]   a profit of $6 million was recorded.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.900]   Listen to Senate Document No. 259,
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.460]   the 65th Congress,
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.160]   reporting on corporate earnings
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.260]   and government revenues.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.720]   Considering the profits
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.820]   of 122 meat packers,
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.640]   153 cotton manufacturers,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.820]   299 garment makers,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.060]   9 steel plants,
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.820]   and 340 coal producers
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.600]   during the war,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.660]   profits under 25%
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.600]   were exceptional.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.640]   For instance,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.340]   the coal companies
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.340]   made between 100%
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.980]   and 7,856%
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.500]   on their capital stock
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.340]   during the war.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.900]   The Chicago Packers
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.240]   doubled and tripled their earnings.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.920]   And let us not forget
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.400]   the bankers who financed
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.100]   the Great War.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.460]   If anyone had the cream
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:52.980]   of the profits,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.100]   it was the bankers.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.780]   Being partnerships
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.140]   rather than incorporating
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.000]   organizations,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.300]   they do not have to report
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.000]   to stockholders.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.620]   And their profits
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.840]   were as secret
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.340]   as they were immense.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.460]   How the bankers made their millions
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.140]   and their billions,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.040]   I do not know.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.080]   Because those little secrets
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.100]   never become public,
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.920]   even before a Senate
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.100]   investigatory body.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.280]   But here's how some of the other
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.680]   patriotic industrialists
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.600]   and speculators
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.300]   chiseled their way
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.220]   into war profits.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.140]   Take the shoe people.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.600]   They like war.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.700]   It brings business
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.040]   with action.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.120]   It brings abnormal profits.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.840]   They made huge profits
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.760]   on sales abroad
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.140]   to our allies.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.360]   Perhaps,
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.680]   like the munitions manufacturers
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.920]   and armament makers,
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.720]   they also sold to the enemy.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.920]   For a dollar
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.820]   is a dollar,
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.580]   whether it comes from Germany
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.760]   or from France.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.320]   But they did well
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.380]   by Uncle Sam too.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.380]   For instance,
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.360]   they sold Uncle Sam
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.640]   35 million pairs
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.380]   of hobnailed service shoes.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.640]   There were 4 million soldiers,
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.520]   8 pairs and more
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.260]   to a soldier.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.280]   My regiment during the war
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.220]   had only one pair
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:19:59.860]   to a soldier.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.300]   Some of these shoes
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.760]   probably are still in existence.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.680]   They were good shoes.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.840]   But when the war was over,
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.340]   Uncle Sam has a matter of
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.800]   25 million pairs left over,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.660]   bought and paid for.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.360]   Profits recorded
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.840]   and pocketed.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.600]   There was still lots of leather left,
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.780]   so the leather people
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.140]   sold your Uncle Sam
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.240]   hundreds of thousands
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.400]   of McClellan saddles
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.120]   for the cavalry.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.800]   But there wasn't any
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.560]   American cavalry
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:26.680]   overseas.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:26.840]   There was no American cavalry
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.220]   overseas.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.860]   Somebody had to get rid
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.680]   of this leather, however.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.280]   Somebody had to make
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.040]   a profit in it.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.300]   So we had a lot
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.580]   of McClellan saddles.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.100]   And we probably
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:36.960]   have those yet.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.080]   Also,
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.160]   somebody had a lot
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.020]   of mosquito netting.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.980]   They sold your Uncle Sam
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.240]   20 million mosquito nets
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.200]   for the use of the soldiers
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.640]   overseas.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.300]   I suppose the boys
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.840]   were expected
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.720]   to put it over them
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.840]   as they tried to sleep
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.000]   in muddy trenches,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.320]   one hand scratching
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.380]   cooties on their backs
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.180]   and the other making passes
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.480]   at scurrying rats.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.620]   Well,
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.740]   not much of a difference
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.940]   Not one of those mosquito nets
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.940]   ever got to France.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.160]   Anyhow,
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.740]   these thoughtful manufacturers
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.600]   wanted to make sure
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.480]   that no soldier
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.200]   would be without
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.160]   his mosquito net.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.640]   So 40 million additional yards
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.500]   of mosquito netting
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.300]   were sold to Uncle Sam.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.700]   There were pretty good profits
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.520]   in mosquito netting
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.100]   in those days,
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.280]   even if there were
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.440]   no mosquitoes in France.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.800]   I suppose
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.420]   if the war had lasted
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.280]   just a little longer,
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.200]   the enterprising
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.660]   mosquito netting manufacturers
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.280]   would have sold
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.840]   your Uncle Sam
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.820]   a couple of consignments
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.380]   of mosquitoes
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:26.720]   to put them
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.780]   to plant in France
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.740]   so that more mosquito netting
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.280]   would be in order.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.780]   Airplane and engine manufacturers
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.760]   felt they too
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.280]   should get their just profits
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.000]   out of this war.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.260]   Why not?
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.500]   Everybody else
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.320]   was getting theirs.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.420]   So,
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.520]   one billion dollars
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.440]   count them
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.520]   if you live long enough
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.220]   was spent by Uncle Sam
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.860]   in building airplane engines
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.200]   that never left the ground.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.740]   Not one plane
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.440]   or motor
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.660]   out of the billion dollars
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.440]   worth ordered
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:56.700]   ever made
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.520]   into a battle
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.160]   in France.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.420]   Just the same,
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.600]   the manufacturers
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.820]   made their little profit
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.520]   of 30,
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.260]   100,
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.100]   or perhaps 300%.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.080]   Undershirts for soldiers
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.740]   cost 14 cents to make
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.400]   and Uncle Sam
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.200]   paid 30 cents
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.900]   to 40 cents
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.700]   each for them.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.660]   A nice little profit
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.060]   for the undershirt manufacturer
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.300]   and the stocking manufacturer
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.980]   and the uniform manufacturers
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.320]   and the cap manufacturers
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.020]   and the steel helmet manufacturers
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.200]   all got theirs.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.160]   Why?
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.680]   When the war was over,
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.980]   some four million sets
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.500]   of equipment,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.120]   knapsacks,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.400]   and the things that go to fill them,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.860]   crammed warehouses
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.700]   on this side.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.800]   Now,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.920]   they are being scrapped
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.400]   because the regulations
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.600]   have changed the contents.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.680]   But,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.960]   the manufacturers
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.600]   collected their wartime profits
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.040]   on them
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.500]   and they will do it
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.520]   all over again
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.160]   the next time.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.860]   There were lots
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.740]   of brilliant ideas
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:49.560]   for profit making
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.160]   during the war.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.820]   One very versatile patriot
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.700]   sold Uncle Sam
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.560]   12 dozen
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.520]   48-inch wrenches.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.320]   Oh,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.740]   they were very nice wrenches.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.720]   The only trouble was
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.320]   that there was only one nut
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:04.920]   ever made
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   that was large enough
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.240]   for these wrenches.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.760]   That is the one
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.140]   that holds the turbines
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.760]   at Niagara Falls.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.380]   Well,
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.420]   after Uncle Sam
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.140]   had bought them
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:15.920]   and the manufacturer
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.040]   had pocketed the profit,
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.500]   the wrenches were put
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.560]   on freight cars
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.220]   and shunted
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.240]   all around the United States
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.240]   in an effort
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.380]   to find a use for them.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.140]   When the armistice
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.640]   was signed,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.500]   it was indeed
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.560]   a sad blow
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.780]   to the wrench manufacturer.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.980]   He was just about
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.960]   to make some nuts
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.300]   to fit the wrenches.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.680]   Then he planned
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.660]   to sell these two
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.740]   to your Uncle Sam.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.160]   Still another
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.020]   had the brilliant idea
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.120]   that colonels
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.860]   shouldn't ride
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.960]   in automobiles
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.020]   nor should they
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.500]   even ride on horseback.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.960]   One has probably
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.620]   seen a picture
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.940]   of Andy Jackson
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.720]   riding in a buckboard.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.520]   Well,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.120]   some 6,000 buckboards
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.380]   were sold to Uncle Sam
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:56.620]   for the price of
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.600]   the use of colonels.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.920]   Not one of them
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.420]   was used,
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.880]   but the buckboard
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.500]   manufacturer
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.800]   got his war profit.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.480]   The shipbuilders
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.540]   felt they should
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.780]   come in on some of it too.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.080]   They built a lot of ships
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.220]   that made a lot of profit.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.120]   More than $3 billion
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.840]   worth.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.940]   Some of the ships
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.520]   were alright,
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.120]   but $635 million
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.140]   worth of them
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.000]   were made of wood
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.300]   and wouldn't float.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.940]   The seams opened up
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.040]   and they sank.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.860]   We paid for them though
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.160]   and somebody
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.240]   pocketed the profits.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.760]   It has been estimated
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.100]   by statisticians
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:30.740]   and economists
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.620]   and researchers
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.760]   that the war
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.980]   cost your Uncle Sam
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.420]   $52 billion.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.160]   Of this sum,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.640]   $39 billion
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.700]   was expended
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.100]   in the actual war itself.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.500]   This expenditure
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.000]   yielded $16 billion
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.820]   in profits.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.520]   That is how
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.380]   the 21,000 billionaires
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.020]   and millionaires
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:50.760]   got that way.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.060]   This $16 billion
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.440]   of profits
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.720]   is not to be sneezed at.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.400]   It is,
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.720]   quite a tidy sum.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.580]   And it went to
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.060]   a very few.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.860]   The Senate,
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.140]   nigh committee,
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.400]   probe of the
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   munitions industry
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.540]   and its wartime profits,
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.660]   despite its sensational disclosures,
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.720]   hardly has scratched the surface.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.900]   Even so,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.000]   it has had some effect.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.640]   The State Department
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   has been studying
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.260]   for some time
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.140]   methods of keeping out
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.120]   of war.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.740]   The War Department
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.640]   suddenly decides
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.140]   it has a wonderful plan
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.560]   to spring up
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.560]   to the United States.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.100]   The administration
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.760]   names a committee
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.800]   with the War and Navy Departments
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.760]   ably represented
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.640]   under the chairmanship
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.560]   of a Wall Street speculator
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.440]   to limit profits
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.600]   in wartime.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.580]   To what extent
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.860]   isn't suggested?
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.000]   Hmm.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.920]   Possibly the profits
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.520]   of 300 and 600
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.380]   and 1,600%
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.400]   of those who turned
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.500]   blood into gold
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.360]   in the World War
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.220]   would be limited
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.540]   to some small
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.100]   or figure.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.520]   Apparently,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.280]   however,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.320]   the plan does not call
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.660]   for any limitation
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.520]   of losses.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.700]   That is,
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.380]   the losses
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.500]   of those who
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.080]   fight the war.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.140]   As far as I have been
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.900]   able to ascertain,
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:13.500]   there is nothing
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.040]   in the scheme
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.880]   to limit a soldier
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.780]   to the loss of
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.900]   but one eye
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.760]   or one arm
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.660]   or to limit his wounds
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.100]   to one or two
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:21.840]   or three
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.880]   or to limit
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.740]   the loss of life.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.220]   There is nothing
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.020]   in this scheme
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.520]   apparently
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.560]   that says
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.480]   not more than
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.880]   12% of a regiment
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.980]   shall be wounded
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.560]   in battle
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.240]   or that not more
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.220]   than 7%
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:34.880]   in a division
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.800]   shall be killed.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.960]   Of course,
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.260]   the committee
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.280]   cannot be bothered
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.040]   with such trifling matters.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.300]   Chapter 3.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.100]   Who pays the bills?
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.200]   Who provides
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.020]   the profits,
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.760]   the nice little profits
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.380]   of 20,
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:52.940]   100,
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.560]   300,
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.740]   1,500
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.880]   and 1,800%?
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.160]   We all pay them
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.140]   in taxation.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.720]   We paid the bankers
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.320]   their profits
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.240]   when we bought
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.080]   liberty bonds
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:03.800]   at $100
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.480]   and sold them back
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.320]   at $84
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.520]   or $86
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.620]   to the bankers.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.680]   These bankers
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.160]   collected $100 plus.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.500]   It was a simple
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.140]   manipulation.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.240]   The bankers
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.080]   controlled the security
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.440]   marts.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.620]   It was easy
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.380]   for them to depress
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.620]   the price of these bonds.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.540]   Then,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.500]   all of us,
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.000]   the people,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.140]   got frightened
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.360]   and sold the bonds
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.160]   at $84
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.500]   or $86.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.220]   The bankers
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.640]   bought them.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.420]   Then,
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.380]   these same bankers
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.400]   stimulated a boom
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.040]   and government bonds
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.740]   went to par
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.660]   and above.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.700]   Then,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.160]   the bankers
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.020]   collected their profits.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   But the soldier
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.160]   pays the biggest part
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.540]   of the bill.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.680]   If you don't believe this,
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.900]   visit the American cemeteries
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.020]   on the battlefields abroad
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.460]   or visit
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.320]   any of the
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.240]   veterans' hospitals
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.200]   in the United States.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.400]   On a tour of the country
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.100]   in the midst of which
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.860]   I am
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.720]   at the time
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.300]   of this writing,
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.920]   I visited
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.460]   18,000
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.580]   government hospitals
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.240]   for veterans.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.080]   In them
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.560]   are a total
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.000]   of about
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.180]   50,000
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.840]   destroyed men.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.320]   Men who were
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.080]   the pick of the nation
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.020]   18 years ago.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.480]   The very
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.140]   able
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:09.940]   chief surgeon
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.480]   at the government
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.040]   hospital
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.960]   at Milwaukee
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.740]   where there are
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.640]   3,800
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.300]   of the living dead
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.800]   told me that
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.520]   mortality
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.360]   among veterans
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   is three times
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:19.780]   as great
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.440]   as among those
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.200]   who stayed at home.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.280]   Boys with a
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.320]   normal viewpoint
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:24.980]   were taken out
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.520]   of the fields
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.100]   and offices
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.440]   and factories
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.580]   and classrooms
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.680]   and put into the ranks.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.220]   There they were
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.480]   remolded.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.400]   They were made over.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.700]   They were made
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.820]   to about face
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.900]   to regard
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.920]   murder
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.040]   as the order
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.560]   of the day.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.860]   They were put
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.760]   shoulder to shoulder
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.440]   and through
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.640]   mass psychology
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.980]   they were
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.500]   entirely changed.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.120]   We used them
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.340]   for a couple of years
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.700]   and trained them
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.460]   to think nothing
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.280]   at all of
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:54.440]   killing.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.700]   Then suddenly
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.840]   we discharged them
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.360]   and told them
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.960]   to make another
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.900]   about face.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.040]   This time
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.620]   they had to do
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.180]   their own
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.420]   readjustment
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.000]   to Sands
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.160]   mass psychology,
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.200]   Sands officers
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.240]   aid and advice
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.680]   and Sands
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.240]   nationwide
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.140]   propaganda.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.820]   We didn't need
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.300]   them anymore.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.100]   So we
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:17.920]   scattered them
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.560]   about without
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.680]   any three minute
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.040]   or liberty loan
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.580]   speeches
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:22.540]   or parades.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.180]   Many,
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.920]   too many
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.400]   of the
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.580]   fine young boys
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.160]   are eventually
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.340]   destroyed
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.000]   mentally
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   because they
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.620]   could not make
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.280]   that final
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.300]   about face
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:36.900]   alone.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.320]   In the government
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.200]   hospital in
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   Marion,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.540]   Indiana,
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.180]   1,800
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.140]   of these boys
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.140]   are in pens.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.000]   500 of them
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.060]   in a barracks
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.120]   with steel bars
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.720]   and wires
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.300]   all around
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.220]   outside the buildings
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.040]   and on the porches.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.440]   These already
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:53.920]   have been
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.040]   mentally destroyed.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.200]   These boys
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.380]   don't even
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.100]   look like
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.920]   human beings.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.540]   Looks on their
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:00.960]   faces.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.540]   Physically,
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.260]   they're in good
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:02.680]   shape.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.060]   Mentally,
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.860]   they are gone.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.960]   There are
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.640]   thousands and
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.140]   thousands of
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.720]   these cases.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.960]   More and more
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.500]   are coming in
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.080]   all the time.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.240]   The tremendous
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.460]   excitement of the
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:14.860]   war,
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.620]   the sudden
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.260]   cutting off
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:17.960]   of that excitement,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.720]   the young boys
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.520]   couldn't stand it.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.260]   That's a part
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.040]   of the bill.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.820]   So much for
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.160]   the dead.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.220]   They have paid
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.840]   their part
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   of the war profits.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.340]   So much for the
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.240]   mentally and physically
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.640]   wounded.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.860]   They are paying
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.980]   now their share
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.280]   of the war profits.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.880]   But the others
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.500]   paid too.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.980]   They paid with
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.600]   heartbreaks
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.400]   when they tore
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.260]   themselves away
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.420]   from their firesides
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.180]   and their families
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.440]   to don the uniform
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.240]   of Uncle Sam
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.460]   on which a
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:46.980]   profit
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.820]   had been made.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.440]   They paid another
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.200]   part in the training
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.060]   camps where they
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.900]   were regimented
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.460]   and drilled
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.060]   while others
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.340]   took their jobs
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.000]   and their places
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.680]   in the lives
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.340]   of their community
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:56.640]   and communities.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.520]   They paid for it
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.140]   in the trenches
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.080]   where they shot
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.800]   and were shot.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.820]   Where they were
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.640]   hungry for days
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.340]   at a time.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.560]   Where they slept
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.200]   in the mud
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.500]   and the cold
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.640]   and in the rain
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.400]   with the moans
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.200]   and shrieks
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:11.900]   of the dying
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.380]   for a horrible
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.000]   lullaby.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.200]   But don't forget
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.120]   the soldier
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:17.780]   paid part of
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.180]   the dollars
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.140]   and cents bills
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.700]   too.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.120]   Up to
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.960]   and including
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.020]   the Spanish-American
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.480]   War,
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.040]   we had a prize
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.700]   system
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.320]   and so
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.560]   soldiers and sailors
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.740]   fought for money.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.400]   During the Civil War
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.360]   they were paid bonuses
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.920]   in many instances
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.960]   before they went
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.720]   into service.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.040]   The government
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:36.820]   or states
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.920]   paid as high
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.000]   as $1,200
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.080]   for an enlistment.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.620]   In the Spanish-American
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:42.960]   War
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.000]   they gave prize money.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.280]   When we captured
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:45.860]   any vessels
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.580]   the soldiers all
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.340]   got their share
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.260]   or at least
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.020]   they were supposed to.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.780]   Then it was found
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.680]   that we could reduce
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.880]   the cost of wars
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.980]   by taking all
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.700]   the prize money
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.440]   and keeping it.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.300]   But,
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.580]   conscripting
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.560]   the soldier
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.520]   anyway.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.120]   Then,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.300]   soldiers couldn't
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.200]   bargain for their
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:03.500]   labor.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.580]   Everyone else
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.140]   could bargain,
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.560]   but the soldier
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.080]   couldn't.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.100]   Napoleon once
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.460]   said,
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.300]   all men
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.100]   are enamored
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.120]   of declarations.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.520]   They positively
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.120]   hunger
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.040]   for them.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.360]   So,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.580]   by developing
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.780]   the Napoleonic
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.240]   system,
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.500]   the metal
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.100]   business,
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.020]   the government
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.680]   learned it could
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.440]   get soldiers
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.560]   for less money
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.280]   because the
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:26.900]   boys liked
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.680]   to be decorated.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.560]   Until the Civil War
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.680]   there were no medals.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.360]   Then the
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.440]   Congressional Medal
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:33.900]   of Honor
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.740]   was handed out.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.180]   It made
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.240]   enlistments easier.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.260]   After the Civil War
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.520]   no new medals
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.040]   were issued
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.780]   until the
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.960]   Spanish-American War.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.160]   In the World War
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.280]   we used propaganda
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.440]   to make the boys
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.700]   accept conscription.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.140]   They were made
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.360]   to feel ashamed
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.620]   if they didn't
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.440]   join the army.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.260]   So vicious
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.260]   was this war
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:56.840]   propaganda
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.740]   that even God
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.660]   was brought into it.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.240]   With few exceptions
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   our clergymen
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   joined in the clamor
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.820]   to kill,
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.260]   kill,
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:03.780]   kill,
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.280]   to kill the Germans.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.080]   God is on our side.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.340]   It is his will
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.040]   that the Germans
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.780]   be killed.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.440]   And in Germany
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.280]   the good pastors
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.720]   called upon the Germans
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.940]   to kill the Allies
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.880]   to please
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.020]   the same God.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.540]   That
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.460]   was a part
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.620]   of the general propaganda
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.220]   built up
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:21.840]   to make people
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.700]   war conscious
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.740]   and murder conscious.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.160]   Beautiful
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.400]   ideals were painted
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.240]   for our boys
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.300]   who were sent out to die.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.660]   This was the
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.740]   war to end all wars.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.680]   This was the
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.320]   war to make the world
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.700]   safe for democracy.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.500]   No one
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.700]   mentioned to them
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.760]   as they marched away
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.780]   that their going
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.300]   and their dying
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.520]   would mean
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.380]   huge
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.240]   war
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.020]   profits.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.780]   No one told
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.900]   these American soldiers
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:50.740]   that they might be
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.380]   shot down
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.280]   by bullets made
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.220]   by their own brothers
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:53.640]   here.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.040]   No one told
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.920]   them that the ships
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.540]   on which they were
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.280]   going to cross
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.100]   might be
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.000]   torpedoed
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.020]   by submarines
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.880]   built with
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.760]   United States
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.420]   patents.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.000]   They were just told
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.520]   it was to be
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.240]   a glorious adventure.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.600]   Thus
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.000]   having stuffed
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.020]   patriotism
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.880]   down their throats
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.060]   it was decided
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:13.920]   to make them
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.500]   help pay
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.500]   for the war too.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.880]   So we gave them
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.060]   the large salary
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.420]   of $30 a month.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.240]   All they had to do
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:21.840]   for this
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.900]   munificent sum
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.560]   was to leave
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.760]   their dear ones behind
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.780]   give up their jobs
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.620]   lie in swampy trenches
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.860]   eat canned willy
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.780]   when they could get it
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.820]   and kill
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:31.640]   and kill
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.580]   and kill
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.400]   and be killed.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.160]   But wait!
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.300]   Half of that wage
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.500]   just a little more
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.120]   than a riveter
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.900]   in a shipyard
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.700]   or a laborer
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.680]   in a munitions factory
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.340]   safe at home
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.100]   made in a day
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.620]   was promptly taken
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.260]   from him
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.880]   to support his dependents
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.440]   so that they
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.220]   would not become
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:49.720]   a charge
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.700]   upon his community.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.560]   Then we made him pay
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.500]   what amounted to
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.080]   accident insurance
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.760]   something the
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.700]   employer pays for
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.280]   in an enlightened state
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.620]   and that cost him
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.640]   $6 a month.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.280]   He had less than
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.600]   $9 a month left.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.880]   Then the most
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.580]   crowning insolence
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.040]   of all
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.900]   he was virtually
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.000]   blackjacked
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.680]   into paying
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.860]   for his own ammunition
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.420]   clothing and food
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.400]   by being made
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.040]   to buy
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.280]   liberty bonds.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.600]   Most soldiers
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.760]   got no money at all
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.480]   on paydays.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.260]   We made them buy
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:23.860]   liberty bonds
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:24.240]   at $100
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.740]   and then we bought
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.280]   them back
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.860]   when they came back
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.480]   from the war
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.460]   and couldn't find work
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.280]   at $84
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.660]   and $86
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.600]   and the soldiers
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.520]   bought about
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.360]   $2 billion
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.740]   worth of these bonds.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.980]   Yes.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.500]   The soldier pays
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.160]   the greater part
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.560]   of the bill.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.460]   His family pays too.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.860]   They pay it
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.840]   in the same heartbreak
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.700]   that he does.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.320]   As he suffers
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.660]   they suffer.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.560]   At night
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.580]   as he lay in the trenches
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.400]   and watched
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.380]   shrapnel
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.480]   burst about him
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.320]   they lay home
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:35:59.980]   in their beds
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.260]   and tossed
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.280]   sleeplessly.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.860]   His father
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.300]   his mother
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.860]   his wife
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.160]   his sisters
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.720]   his brothers
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.440]   his sons
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.540]   and his daughters.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.380]   When he returned home
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.260]   minus an eye
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.880]   or minus a leg
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.020]   or with his mind
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.540]   broken
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.420]   they suffered too
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.080]   as much as
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.340]   and even sometimes
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.280]   more than he.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.840]   Yes,
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.460]   and they too
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.620]   contributed their dollars
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:24.940]   to the war.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.820]   To the profits
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.100]   of the munitions makers
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.100]   and bankers
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.180]   and shipbuilders
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.000]   and the manufacturers
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.900]   and the speculators made.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.900]   They too bought
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.860]   liberty bonds
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.700]   and contributed
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.280]   to the profit
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:36.940]   of the bankers
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.040]   after the armistice
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.540]   and the hocus pocus
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.420]   of manipulated
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.620]   liberty bond prices.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.720]   And even now
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.760]   the families
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.380]   of the wounded men
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.500]   and of the mentally broken
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.340]   and those who never
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.540]   were able to readjust
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.040]   themselves
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.140]   are still suffering
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.060]   and still
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.660]   paying.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:00.460]   Chapter 4
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.720]   How to smash
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.480]   this racket
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.160]   Well,
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.580]   it's a racket
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:06.980]   all right.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.140]   A few profit
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.960]   and the many pay.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.660]   But there is a way
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.180]   to stop it.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.820]   You can't end it
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.260]   by disarmament conferences.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.760]   You can't eliminate it
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.880]   by peace parlays
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.660]   at Geneva.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.980]   Well-meaning
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.220]   but impractical groups
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.080]   can't wipe it out
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.920]   by resolutions.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.640]   It can be smashed
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.480]   effectively
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.760]   only by taking
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.480]   the profit
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.560]   out of war.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.140]   The only way
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.160]   to smash this racket
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.540]   is to conscript
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.160]   capital
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:34.960]   and industry
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.580]   and labor
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.080]   before the nation's
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.640]   manhood
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.760]   can be conscripted.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.180]   One month
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:40.880]   before the government
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.620]   can conscript
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.240]   the young men
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:42.760]   of the nation
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.180]   it must conscript
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:44.760]   capital
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.460]   and industry
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:45.980]   and labor.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.500]   Let the officers
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.420]   and the directors
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.380]   and the high-powered
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:49.920]   executives
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.460]   of our armament factories
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.240]   and our munitions makers
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.520]   and our shipbuilders
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:54.620]   and our military
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.720]   and our airplane builders
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.200]   and the manufacturers
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.340]   of all the other things
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.220]   that provide profit
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.960]   in wartime
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.760]   as well as the bankers
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.060]   and the speculators
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.760]   be conscripted
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.780]   to get $30 a month
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.940]   the same wage
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.600]   as the lads
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.480]   in the trenches get.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.920]   Let the workers
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.600]   in these plants
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.560]   get the same wage
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.700]   as all the workers
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.620]   all presidents
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.360]   all executives
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.100]   all directors
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.220]   all managers
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.100]   all bankers
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:18.500]   yes
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.560]   and all generals
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.600]   and all admirals
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.480]   and all officers
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   and all politicians
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.240]   and all government
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:23.900]   office holders.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.480]   Let everyone in the nation
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.180]   be restricted
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.820]   to a total monthly income
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.300]   not to exceed
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.060]   that paid to the soldier
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:31.760]   in the trenches.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.040]   Let all these kings
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.140]   and tycoons
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.620]   and masters of business
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.040]   and all those workers
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:38.660]   and industry
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.680]   and all our senators
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.440]   and governors
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.200]   and majors
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.480]   pay half of their
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.900]   monthly $30 wage
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.720]   to their families
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.860]   and pay war risk insurance
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.380]   and buy liberty bonds.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.160]   Why shouldn't they?
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.780]   They aren't running
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.020]   any risk of being killed
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.300]   or of having their bodies
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:54.740]   mangled
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.880]   or their minds shattered.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.980]   They aren't sleeping
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.700]   in muddy trenches.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.620]   They aren't hungry.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:38:59.600]   The soldiers are.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.400]   Give capital
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:01.960]   and industry
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.440]   and labor
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.020]   30 days to think it over
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.060]   and you will find
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   by that time
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.260]   there will be no war.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.860]   They will smash
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.660]   the war racket.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.660]   That
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.980]   and nothing else.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.740]   Maybe I am
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.720]   a little too optimistic.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.880]   Capital still has some say.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.740]   So capital won't permit
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.320]   the taking of the profit
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:20.920]   out of war
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.600]   until the people
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.380]   those who do the suffering
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.180]   and still pay the price
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.680]   make up their minds
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.640]   that those they elect to office
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.180]   shall do their bidding
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.320]   and not that of the profiteers.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.480]   Another step necessary
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.000]   in this fight
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.220]   to smash the war racket
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.000]   is the limited plebiscite
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.340]   to determine whether a war
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.140]   should be declared.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.700]   A plebiscite
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.500]   not of all the voters
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.200]   but merely of those
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.360]   who would be called upon
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.160]   to do the fighting
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.260]   and dying.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.680]   There wouldn't be
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.480]   very much sense
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.340]   in having a 76-year-old
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.160]   president of a munitions factory
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.060]   or the flakiest
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.080]   flat-footed head
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.060]   of an international
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:56.920]   banking firm
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.720]   or the cross-eyed manager
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.760]   of a uniform manufacturing plant
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.220]   all of whom see visions
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.380]   of tremendous profits
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.360]   in the event of war
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.040]   voting on whether the nation
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.540]   should go to war or not.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.500]   They never would be called upon
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.380]   to shoulder arms
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.680]   to sleep in a trench
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.720]   and to be shot.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.340]   Only those
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.480]   who would be called upon
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.540]   to risk their lives
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.300]   for their country
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.560]   should have the privilege
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.660]   of voting to determine
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.460]   whether the nation
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.340]   should go to war.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.400]   There is ample precedent
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:23.940]   for restrictions
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.540]   restricting the voting
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.360]   to those affected.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.160]   Many of our states
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.920]   have restrictions
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.320]   on those permitted to vote.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.660]   In most,
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.400]   it is necessary
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.900]   to be able to read and write
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.100]   before you may vote.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.320]   In some,
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.600]   you must own property.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.180]   It would be a simple matter
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:38.640]   each year
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.360]   for the men coming
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.420]   of military age
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.400]   to register
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.180]   in their communities
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.500]   as they did in the draft
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.600]   during the World War
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.820]   and be examined physically.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.320]   Those who could pass
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.560]   and who would therefore
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.240]   be called upon
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:49.960]   to bear arms
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.860]   in the event of war
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:51.620]   would be eligible
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.100]   to vote
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.460]   in a limited plebiscite.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.360]   They should be the ones
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.280]   to have the power
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.960]   to decide
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.680]   and not a Congress
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.780]   few of whose members
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.880]   are within the age limit
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.180]   and fewer still
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.620]   of whom are in physical condition
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.520]   to bear arms.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.920]   Only those who must suffer
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.620]   should have the right to vote.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.280]   A third step
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.880]   in this business
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.320]   of smashing the war racket
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.080]   is to make certain
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.420]   that our military forces
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.520]   are truly forces
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.620]   for defense only.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.780]   At each session of Congress,
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.760]   the question of further
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.420]   naval appropriations comes up.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.660]   The swivel chair admirals
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.320]   of Washington,
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.600]   and there are always
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.200]   a lot of them,
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.360]   are very adroit lobbyists
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.080]   and they are smart.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.840]   They don't shout that
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.900]   we need a lot of battleships
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.920]   to war on this nation
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.640]   or that nation.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.420]   Oh, no.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.940]   First of all,
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.580]   they let it be known
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.080]   that America is menaced
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.840]   by a great naval power.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.300]   Almost any day,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.660]   these admirals will tell you,
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.360]   the great fleet
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.620]   of this supposed enemy
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.760]   will strike suddenly
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.960]   and annihilate
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.900]   125 million people
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.120]   just like that.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.160]   Then they begin to cry
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.600]   for a larger navy.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.320]   For what?
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.460]   To fight the enemy?
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.020]   Oh, my no.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.700]   Oh, no.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.480]   For defense purposes only.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.160]   Then, incidentally,
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   they announce maneuvers
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.760]   in the Pacific
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.520]   for defense.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.680]   The Pacific is a great big ocean.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   We have a tremendous coastline
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.220]   on the Pacific.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.240]   Will the maneuvers
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.280]   be off the coast
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.000]   two or three hundred miles?
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.060]   Oh, no.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.460]   The maneuvers will be
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.460]   2,000, yes,
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.480]   perhaps even 3,500 miles
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.240]   off the coast.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.100]   The Japanese,
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.680]   a proud people, of course,
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.120]   will be pleased
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.440]   beyond expression
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.940]   to see the United States fleet
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.220]   so close to Nippon's shores.
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.100]   Even as pleased
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.420]   as would be the residents
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.360]   of California
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.500]   were they to dimly discern
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.020]   through the morning mist
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.620]   the Japanese fleet
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.180]   playing at war games
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.280]   off Los Angeles.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.020]   The ships of our Navy,
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.080]   it can be seen,
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.620]   should be specifically limited
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.320]   by law
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.520]   to within 200 miles
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.540]   of our coastline.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.340]   Had that been the law
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.500]   in 1898,
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.980]   the Maine would never have gone
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.840]   to Havana Harbor.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.820]   She never would have been blown up.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.260]   There would have been no war
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:10.880]   with Spain
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.520]   with its attendant loss of life.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.480]   200 miles is ample
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.800]   in the opinion of experts
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.840]   for defense purposes.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.160]   Our nation cannot start
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.180]   an offensive war
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.020]   if its ships can't go further
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.140]   than 200 miles
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.040]   from the coastline.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.700]   Planes might be permitted
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.880]   to go as far as 500 miles
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.460]   from the coast
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.020]   for the purposes of reconnaissance.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.280]   And the Army should never
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.320]   leave the territorial limits
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.980]   of our nation.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.780]   To summarize,
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.720]   three steps must be taken
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.120]   to smash the war racket.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.600]   One,
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.200]   we must take the profit
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.860]   out of war.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.160]   Two,
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.940]   we must permit the youth
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:49.500]   of the land
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   who would bear arms
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.100]   to decide whether or not
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:52.940]   there should be war.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.660]   Three,
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.860]   we must limit our military forces
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.440]   to home defense purposes.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.860]   Chapter 5.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.680]   To Hell with War.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.820]   I am not a fool
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.160]   as to believe that war
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.240]   is a thing of the past.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.500]   I know the people
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.480]   do not want war,
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.500]   but there is no use in saying
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.700]   we cannot be pushed
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.800]   into another war.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.320]   Looking back,
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.100]   Woodrow Wilson
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.480]   was re-elected president
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.440]   in 1916 on a platform
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.260]   that he had
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.740]   kept us out of war
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.540]   and on the implied promise
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.580]   that he would
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.600]   keep us out of war.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.700]   Yet,
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:32.680]   five months later,
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.800]   he asked Congress
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.320]   to declare war on Germany.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.740]   In that five-month interval,
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.260]   the people had not been asked
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.060]   whether they had changed their minds.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.160]   The four million young men
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.120]   who put on uniforms
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.620]   and marched or sailed away
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.480]   were not asked
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.880]   whether they wanted to go forth
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.360]   to suffer and die.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.540]   Then what caused our government
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.460]   to change its mind?
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.080]   And so suddenly,
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.840]   money.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.360]   An Allied commission,
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.160]   it may be recalled,
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.000]   came over shortly
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.240]   before the war declaration
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.300]   and called on the president.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.980]   The president summoned
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.920]   a group of advisors.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.840]   The head of the commission spoke.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.920]   Stripped of its diplomatic language,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.900]   this is what he told
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.200]   the president and his group.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.940]   There is no use
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.140]   kidding ourselves any longer.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.500]   The cause of the Allies is lost.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.500]   We now owe you,
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.440]   American bankers,
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   American munitions makers,
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.660]   American manufacturers,
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.760]   American speculators,
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   American exporters,
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.300]   five or six billion dollars.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.940]   If we lose,
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:29.700]   and without the help
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.380]   of the United States,
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.160]   we must lose,
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.820]   we, England, France,
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.220]   and Italy cannot pay back this money.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.560]   And Germany won't.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.000]   So,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.020]   had secrecy been outlawed
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.440]   as far as war negotiations
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.140]   were concerned,
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.760]   and had the press been invited
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.440]   to be present at that conference,
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.360]   or had radio been available
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.740]   to broadcast the proceedings,
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.260]   American,
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.280]   never would have entered
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.000]   the World War.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.720]   But this conference,
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.420]   like all war discussions,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.240]   was shrouded in utmost secrecy.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.660]   When our boys were sent off to war,
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.000]   they were told it was a
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.580]   war to make the world
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.740]   safe for democracy,
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:10.400]   and a war to end all wars.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.420]   Well, 18 years after,
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.800]   the world has less of democracy
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.120]   than it had then.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.220]   Besides,
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.480]   what business is it of ours,
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.840]   whether Russia or Germany
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.380]   or England,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.020]   or France or Italy or Austria,
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.840]   live under democracies or monarchies,
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.340]   whether they are fascists or communists?
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.860]   Our problem is to preserve
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.780]   our own democracy.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.800]   And very little, if anything,
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.560]   has been accomplished to assure us
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.100]   that the World War was really
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.740]   the war to end all wars.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:42.180]   Yes, we have had disarmament conferences
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.680]   and limitations of arms conferences.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.480]   They don't mean a thing.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.300]   One has just failed.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.640]   The results of another
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.280]   have been nullified.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.540]   And our professional soldiers
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.340]   and our sailors
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.380]   and our politicians
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.480]   and our diplomats
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.320]   to these conferences.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.020]   And what happens?
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.660]   Professional soldiers and sailors
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.620]   don't want to disarm.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.240]   No admiral wants to be without a ship.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.560]   No general wants to be without a command.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.060]   Both mean men without jobs.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.220]   They are not for disarmament.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.120]   They cannot be for limitations of arms.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.860]   And at all these conferences
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.180]   lurking in the background,
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.940]   but all powerful, just the same,
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.360]   are the sinister agents
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   of those who profit by war.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.920]   They see to it that these conferences
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.840]   do not disarm or seriously limit armaments.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.200]   The chief aim of any power
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.340]   at any of these conferences
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.400]   has not been to achieve disarmament
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.200]   to prevent war,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.200]   but rather to get more armament for itself
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.940]   and less for any potential foe.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.720]   There is only one way to disarm
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.480]   with any semblance of practicability.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.700]   That is, for all nations to get together
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   and scrap every ship, every gun,
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.340]   every rifle, every tank, every warboat,
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:52.700]   every plane.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.740]   Even this, if it were possible,
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.720]   would not be enough.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.740]   The next war, according to experts,
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.780]   will be fought not with battleships,
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.580]   not by artillery, not with rifles,
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.720]   and not with machine guns.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.760]   It will be fought with deadly chemicals
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.620]   and gases.
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.040]   Secretly, each nation is studying
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.420]   and perfecting newer and gaslier means
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.160]   of annihilating its foes wholesale.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.180]   Yes, ships will continue to be built,
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.280]   for the shipbuilders must make their profits.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.060]   And guns still will be manufactured
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:22.320]   and used for the purpose of
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.300]   and powder and rifles will be made,
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.920]   for the munitions makers must make their huge profits.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.760]   And the soldiers, of course, must wear uniforms,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.040]   for the manufacturer must make their war profits too.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.220]   But victory or defeat will be determined
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.860]   by the skill and ingenuity of our scientists.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.280]   If we put them to work making poison gas
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.540]   and more and more fiendish mechanical
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.240]   and explosive instruments of destruction,
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.100]   they will have no time for the constructive job
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.820]   of building greater prosperity for all peoples.
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.720]   By putting them to this useful job,
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.560]   we can all make more money out of peace
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.720]   than we can out of war,
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.560]   even the munitions makers.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.340]   So I say,
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.340]   to hell with war.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:08.420]   Thus concludes
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:13.600]   Major General Butler's pamphlet
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.280]   and his speech.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.960]   It's hard for me to know what to say
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.220]   because here we are
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.560]   more than a hundred years later
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.280]   and you can see that
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   I can see as well as I can
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.720]   what of his comments have held true
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.600]   and what hasn't.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:33.360]   The difficult issue is simply
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.280]   that we should pay attention
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.220]   to the details that we need to know about.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.960]   But we should not delude ourselves
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.180]   by thinking that
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.420]   war is exclusively about
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.820]   what is right and wrong.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.120]   Nor should we delude ourselves
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.260]   to think that in most cases
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.940]   war is even primarily
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.820]   about what is right and wrong.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.040]   I myself don't know exactly
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.500]   where all those lines are drawn.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.740]   You look at some conflicts
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.580]   and the morality is clearer than in others.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.060]   I don't know exactly where you should draw
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.060]   the lines of each different thing.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.800]   All I know is that war is hell
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.760]   and it ought not to be profited on.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.980]   I don't want any money from it.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.920]   I hope that you don't want any money from it.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.320]   But at the end of the day
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.080]   the world is full of wicked men
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.420]   who are going to profit on war
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.840]   until righteous men stand up
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.900]   and say enough is enough.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.360]   I have no idea how to do that.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.300]   But I wanted to be faithful
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.420]   to wage my little protest here
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.000]   in the form of
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.620]   reading you this essay.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.300]   As far as I'm concerned
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.540]   this essay should be
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.640]   mandatory reading
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.800]   for every person,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.700]   every citizen,
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:52.780]   every voter,
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.660]   every young person,
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.940]   every young man or woman
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.020]   whoever wants to go and enlist in the military
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.600]   must read this essay first
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.380]   and then act accordingly.
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.740]   I pray that God would give us wisdom
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.500]   of how to defend righteousness and justice
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:12.160]   and to eliminate wickedness and violence
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:12.920]   all over the world.
