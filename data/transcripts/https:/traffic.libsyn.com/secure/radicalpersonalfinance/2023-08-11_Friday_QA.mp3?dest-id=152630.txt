[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.500]   Eric, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today? Hi, Joshua. Thanks so much for taking the
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.440]   call. I love what you do. My question is around more so the career aspect of some of the things
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.120]   you talk about. I've listened to a good number of the old episodes, and I hear people talking
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.240]   about a career and income course. You've mentioned it quite frequently with other callers, and so I
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.520]   wonder if you had any plans on maybe making that available again, or if that's something that you've
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.220]   closed off completely. And the reason is because I've been working in a particular industry, in the
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.760]   insurance industry. Some of those alphabets after your name are very familiar to me. And I've just
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:25.660]   kind of gotten maybe bored with the industry and looking for a career change, but just wanting to
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.120]   have a good framework on how I might process my next step. I make decent money, so that's not an
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.220]   issue, but just looking to see what my next move might be for the next maybe five to 10 years.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.940]   Yeah. I have been planning to release that course, and I'll tell you why I took it off the market.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.600]   When I sat down, I started doing private courses after years of doing various things to try to
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.820]   figure out how to make money on radical personal finance. And once I gave up my vendetta to try to
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.200]   do everything with the money, I started doing private courses. And I've been doing private
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.540]   courses for a long time. And I've been doing private courses for a long time. And I've been
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.640]   doing private courses for a long time. And I've been doing private courses for a long time. And I've
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.980]   been doing private courses for a long time. And I've been doing private courses for a long time.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.060]   Free, open source, listener support stuff. When I sat down, I said, I don't have any interest in
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.300]   talking about stuff that's well covered, but I have interest in talking about stuff that's the
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.680]   most impactful. And I said, where should I begin? And I said, well, the single thing that is not
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.600]   discussed by financial planners that should be discussed is the importance of your career and
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.240]   your income. And to me, it's obviously the most blindingly obvious thing when you say it out loud,
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.320]   go through all of your training, all of your personal finance books and whatnot. Nobody talks
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.340]   about it. It seemed to me years ago that nobody talks about it. Maybe they talk about it now.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.700]   I've heard people talk about it. It's like, if you want to help people to become wealthy,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.920]   the very first thing that you need to do is to help them to get a job that they like,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.620]   that's a good fit for them, where they can do well in it, and then to make as much money as
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.800]   they possibly can for as long as they possibly can. Those are the two components of it. You want
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.160]   your income to be as high as possible. And then you want your income to be as high as possible.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.400]   But you also want it to come in for as long as possible. And that means that you can't just do
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.380]   something that you're doing just for money for the short term. You need to do something that's
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.220]   a good fit for you so you can build a 60, 70, 80-year career out of something. And then you
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.120]   want that thing to be a very high paying, and you want to approach it strategically.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.620]   And so I sat down and I wrote from scratch what I called my career and income course.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.140]   And when I started, so when I released it, when I recorded it, I had a great number of
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.800]   students signed up for it. And I went through it, and I did it, and I sold it for a while. But
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.920]   I only got a little bit of feedback from it. And I was a little bit annoyed about that. Not bad at
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.480]   anybody, but I was just like, was it good? This was not my area of professional training. I had
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.060]   all this professional training in financial planning. And I thought, I think this stuff
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.440]   is really good and really useful and whatnot. But I just wasn't sure. And so I was also over time,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.440]   I was kind of embarrassed by what I perceived as the low production quality that I had focused.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.680]   And all of my stuff, I'm good at focusing on content. And I felt like the market means,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.300]   meant that I needed to put in B-roll and make everything look nicer and snazzier, et cetera.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.880]   And I wanted to do that. So anyway, I pulled the course from the market because I was a little
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.080]   embarrassed about the production quality of it. And then when I mentioned this publicly one time,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.900]   all of a sudden, a bunch of my students reached out to me and sent me email after email after email,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.720]   which was very gratifying of saying, no, Joshua, the course was fantastic. And sometimes they show
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.740]   up in Friday calls of, I've doubled my income, I've tripled my income, but I've got stacks of
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.740]   personal emails even more just saying about how great it was. And so getting that feedback that
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.460]   took a while to come in, because this was years ago when I first released it, getting that feedback
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.340]   that yes, this stuff that I taught is working for people has increased my confidence about
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.080]   the value of those ideas that I shared. And so I am intending to
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.880]   re-record it and I am intending to release it because it definitely is, I consider a cornerstone
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.780]   of financial success. And as I've taught publicly here on the podcast, before I ever do financial
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.780]   planning with people, I always encourage them, you've got three big decisions to make. Number
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.720]   one, you have to decide who you're going to live with, which is why a focus on relationships is
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.060]   really important. If you want to get married, get married. If you want to have children,
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.820]   get close to mom and dad. If you want to be far away from mom and dad, get far away from mom and
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.240]   dad, just do it. And then do that before you get out of debt or do anything else. Just make those
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.540]   decisions. Number two is where do you live? Because after the people that you live with,
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.340]   the place that you choose to live drives your lifestyle. And so if you want to live in the
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.220]   mountains, go to the mountains. If you want to live by the beach, go to the beach. If you want
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.920]   to live in another country, go. Number three is then what do you do for work? And so you should
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.880]   get very clear on what you're doing for work and move aggressively in that direction.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.260]   And I feel like this framework puts things into a proper perspective because there's always a
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.480]   tension where someone says, I'm getting out of debt or I've got student loans or should I take
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.580]   out student loans, et cetera. And while I'm not opining dogmatically on debt here, the point is
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.020]   that if you can get into a career that's a good fit for you and you can set up a lifestyle that's
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.240]   a good fit for you, then your ability to do long-term planning is built on a solid foundation.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.020]   And everything else where you just focus on
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.040]   financial planning and whatnot, if those things aren't solid, you're building on shifting sand
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.180]   and you can't build long-term plans until those three things are done.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.860]   And so I have a passion for trying to help people make those decisions intelligently,
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.340]   effectively, et cetera. And so back to the career, it comes down to kind of what you're
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.860]   talking or personally, it comes down to the process of choosing a career as intelligently
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.000]   as possible with as much foresight as possible, choosing something that's a good fit for you
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.960]   or that you think might be a good fit for you. And then as you're in it, then we move into
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.440]   systematically enhancing that career really intentionally so that you move very quickly
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.280]   up through the income ranks. And that's the basic thesis of my course. That's the basic
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.560]   thesis of everything that I do. So yes, it is coming in the future.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.360]   Okay. Great. Great. Thank you.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.620]   Tell me about your situation though.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.880]   Well, right now I'm,
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.360]   I work, I've been, been in the insurance industry on the production side, working
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.680]   with an insurance agent. That's fine. You don't have to run away from those words. It's fine.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.600]   Well, I'm actually not the owner agent, but I am.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.020]   That's fine. You're an insurance agent. Fine.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:51.600]   Yeah. And so kind of accidentally in a way kind of dropped into this career and it's been
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.740]   rewarding. I've had some great experiences and made some good things happen.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.920]   But now, now that some of those bigger questions are coming up, I called last week about the home
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:09.700]   purchasing. So now as we're considering you making some, some steps in, in terms of long-term
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.520]   commitments and where we want to be, I feel like that decision was most important before we got
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.460]   into like changing jobs for a number of reasons. So now that we've made that decision and we're
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.520]   wanting to, you know, we've, we've got a clear picture of where we want to be in terms of family
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:25.720]   and support. And so I feel like that's a big part of it. I feel like that's a big part of it.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:33.240]   Now I'm willing to see what else is out there. Cause I mean, I've had my head down in this
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:40.640]   industry for 10 plus years and it's been good to me, but I just, I'm not aware of what else is out
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.760]   there, what else is available. So that's where we are now.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.960]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, there are three basic strategies that you can use and you should use all of these
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.700]   to try to guide yourself. If you're thinking you might be interested in moving forward,
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:01.620]   moving in a different direction. So strategy number one is introspection. Introspection just
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.960]   simply means observing what you yourself think about what you yourself feel, what you yourself
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.400]   experience. And my simple way I've told the story publicly, and I have more on this in the course,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   but I'll just give the public story is just making a list of things that you think you might be
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.880]   interested in and not censoring yourself being open to it. So, you know, put it, make a list on
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.680]   the notes app on your phone, put it in your inbox, put it in your inbox, put it in your
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:32.220]   phone. You know, you keep a separate notebook or page somewhere, just make a list. And as you pass
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:40.140]   through life, anytime that you see something that interests you, then write it down. And if possible,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.520]   if you have any idea of why it might interest you, then make a note of it. And so I'll just
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.080]   share, you know, a few random ones that I used to have on my list and things that I still keep. I
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.660]   still keep this list so that I have backup plans in case I want to go on. But I noticed when I was
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.920]   younger that I enjoyed traveling. And so I thought, you know what, I would think it'd be fun to work in
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.300]   the hotel industry because I like my, my, my undergraduate degree is an international
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.320]   business. How wouldn't it be fun to work for, you know, some hotel somewhere, work for Hilton
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.520]   hotels on an international basis or something like that. That would be interesting. And I like
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.300]   talking to people. I enjoy that. So even if I were a concierge or some kind of front facing thing,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.360]   I've always been good at dealing with people. I don't get upset. And so I thought that would be
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.640]   really interesting to me. Um, I used to, I still enjoy spending time with people. I still enjoy
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.520]   coffee shops and I thought it wouldn't be fun to work, work in a coffee shop. What a great
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.920]   atmosphere it would be. I would enjoy it. I enjoy the atmosphere. I thought wouldn't be fun to be a
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.980]   truck driver because again, well, I like to travel across the country and I like sleeping in cars.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.380]   And so being a truck driver seemed really interesting, but then also then you look,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.140]   those are, those are very simple, just straightforward jobs that are easy to get.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:55.500]   But then I also noticed and pay attention to when things went along the way,
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.320]   I, uh, there are things that are more interesting to me. So for example,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.280]   I have a friend of mine. He's, I interviewed him years ago on the, on the podcast,
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.460]   but my friend is a turn was, is, and was a turnaround specialist. He had had a big career
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.460]   in the corporate world. He'd retired. And then basically he and his friends started buying
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.560]   companies and he just did this turnaround work. And I thought, wouldn't that be awesome to, to be
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.820]   such a skilled businessman that I can come in, find a company that's struggling and then turn it around.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.300]   And I noticed what appealed to me about it. So things like the seasonality of it, I noticed that
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.040]   I really liked the idea of working really hard for three, four or five years, whatever it takes
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.100]   to come into a company and, and turn it around and then take a year or two off. I love the
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.480]   seasonality idea of that. Uh, I like the business side of it. I see businesses systems. And so it
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.900]   works in my brain. When I was younger, I noticed that I really liked, I admired the lifestyle of
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.160]   an author. So I always imagined myself and I put, what if I were an author? I would really enjoy
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.180]   that. It's kind of a solitary pursuit, but I can go around the world. I can research things. I can
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.780]   write things, et cetera. I used to love listening to talk radio. And so I noticed, I said, you know,
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:11.640]   I thought I listened to this, um, local talk radio station and, and I'm not going to say the
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.480]   name of the show because they're pretty vulgar. Uh, but I used to listen to these guys get,
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.360]   just get on a microphone for three or four hours a day. And I would listen to them at the time I
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.140]   was working on a farm, uh, driving a tractor across the field. And as I would listen to them, uh, while
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:31.840]   I'm driving my tractor. And I just thought, you know what? I really enjoy, uh, I enjoy this,
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.720]   this scenario. And so to show up to a studio and banter on a microphone for four or five hours is
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.860]   not difficult for me. And so those are just things that I've noticed for myself across the way.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.680]   And if you do this over the course of weeks, months, years, you'll make a pretty decent list.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:55.120]   And again, the key is don't censor it. I can pretty easily say today, uh, because I've,
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.980]   I can pretty easily say today that, Hey, I think it'd be fun to work at Panera bread,
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.300]   but I was embarrassed about that when I was a 23, because I'm supposed to be a business guy,
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.000]   but I just thought it would be a fun to be in that atmosphere. And so introspection can lead
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.580]   you to understand some of the things that you're interested in, some of the things that you're
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.980]   attracted to. And if you can put those things down on paper and you wind up with a list of 50 or,
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:21.920]   you know, 20 or 75 different things. And especially if you can put the job and then put a little
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.100]   phrase or sentence saying what attracts you to it,
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.840]   uh, and so you can get some sense of it. Now you can create something that's really powerful.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.840]   And if you can get that list down on paper, you can coach yourself because you can look at it and
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:44.060]   you can say, what are some of the common themes of these different, uh, businesses or jobs?
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:50.560]   And so things like for me, again, I don't recommend it. I see the downsides of a
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.080]   vagabond lifestyle, but I've always been attracted to the idea of going from
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.220]   place to place. I've always been attracted to the idea of learning new languages.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:04.080]   I've been attracted to the idea of personal freedom. That's a central aspect of my themes.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.700]   Other people's themes would be very different. Uh, you know, other, and someone else might have,
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.980]   uh, a very clear vision of, I'd like to wear a really nice suit every day and work in a downtown
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:20.200]   office tower, uh, or whatever the things are. And so you can see the themes of those. And then if
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.380]   you can put those on a paper and you can see the themes, then you can extrapolate to step two,
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.060]   which would be,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:31.540]   well, what are some ideas of jobs or businesses that might incorporate some of these themes?
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:38.320]   So the first, first thing is introspection. The second thing is external, uh, like assessments.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.940]   And so there's a whole world. I'm not current on it. I need to, so I'm not going to say any names,
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.900]   but there's a whole world of career tools that have been developed by coaches and organizations
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:55.040]   and whatnot to help you identify personality characteristics, interests, things like that,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.240]   that can help expose you to different things that you yourself might be interested in.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.480]   Some of them are better than others, but I don't, I think that most of them are worth taking,
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.720]   taking. And the great thing about career tools is that when you're taking them,
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.960]   they kind of expose you. If you keep your notebook handy and write down your own introspection list,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.500]   they expose you to different ideas that you may or may not be interested in.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:25.020]   And what shocked me so much was after years of introspection and after,
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:30.320]   after 10 different jobs that I had done, I took for the first time a disc profile assessment
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.780]   and I got the results back from it. I think it was the one that Dan Miller was promoting with
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:41.940]   his 48 days to the work you love, um, stuff. And I got the results back and I look at the
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:47.580]   list of jobs that are recommended for me. And of that list, I forget now, so I'm speaking broadly,
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:53.620]   but it seemed like three fourths of them were things that I had already done or specific
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.000]   things that were on my list.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.640]   And I thought, man, this is fantastic. I've already figured this out myself that I've tried this. I
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.100]   tried this. I tried this. This was a good fit. This was a good fit. This is what I'm doing now.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.820]   This is on my list. This is on my list. This is on my list. Like this is really great. And so I think
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.580]   the second thing again is those external assessments. And then the third thing that
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.660]   you can do is engage with a third party. And so if you engage systematically with a third party,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:24.540]   an outsider, then that person can often give you ideas that you yourself,
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.480]   are a little bit blind to. And so that third party can be your wife. That third party could
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.220]   be your brother. That third party can be your best friend. That third party can be a coworker.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.800]   That third party can be someone that you know from college. The third party can be a professional
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.340]   coach, a career coach of some kind. The third party can be, and should be probably a long
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.860]   list of people, including people who are in and around the careers that, that you're interested
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.640]   in. The advice that I always give, sometimes people book me for consulting.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.800]   And they do it because they're interested in going to the financial industry. And because I have some
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.700]   experience in that, I say, well, I'm talking to this recruiter and tell me straight and whatnot.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:09.160]   And so I give them my opinions, of course. But one of the pieces of homework I always do is I say,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.280]   lay out for yourself a list of the different models that you know. So you're interviewing
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.620]   with Edward Jones. Great. Well, interview with Edward Jones, interview with State Farm,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.260]   interview with Northwestern Mutual, interview with Merrill Lynch, interview with your local RIA.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.480]   Interview with your local Primerica representative. Lay out for yourself.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:37.160]   Force yourself to go into the industry and figure out a dozen different perspectives in this
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:43.640]   industry. And then reach out to people and go for an interview or go for a lunch and talk to people
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:50.660]   and engage with them. And so tell them a little bit about yourself and ask them where they think
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.820]   you would flourish. And then what I do is I try to ask people,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:02.020]   and say, if you weren't doing what you're doing, if you weren't working in your current industry,
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.120]   because, okay, you're a life insurance agent. All right. If you weren't a life insurance agent,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:12.160]   what would you go and do if you weren't a life insurance agent? Because most of us have our
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.720]   list of things that we're attracted to or that we've noticed. And so as a life insurance agent,
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:24.380]   I got annoyed that I couldn't cause, I couldn't, I didn't have ongoing contact with people that was
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.520]   from some kind of regular basis. And so I would look at, you know, I had a client who had a big
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.460]   state farm agency and I would look at his state farm agency. I was like, well, he, his clients by
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.060]   law are required to have insurance. And how awesome is that? They have to have insurance.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.620]   Or you work with someone who's accountant, an accountant and has a financial planning practice
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.520]   on the side. And you say, well, by his clients need tax returns. And so he's got his clients
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.640]   in the office every single year. And so they're there sitting there ready to speak to him.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.980]   Or I would look at Rick Edelman and I would say, well, Rick Edelman has,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.240]   thousands and thousands of listeners to his radio show and to his books. And so he's got this
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.720]   massive pool, et cetera. And so I knew those shortcomings of my, my previous career model.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.100]   And so if you had asked me something like that, of course I would tell you and people tell you.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.840]   And so if you listen to people about what they're doing and then you listen to what they would do,
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.460]   it gives you more tools, more fodder for your introspection list.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:24.820]   And then ask them what they would go after and ask them what they,
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.340]   think you should go after. And if you do that with enough people, you know,
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:33.080]   let's say over six months, you meet with 50 people, which is pretty easy to do.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.320]   You will find yourself with so many ideas and so many people. And those are the people that
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.540]   lead to connections. Those connections, they're the ones who introduce you to people, leads you
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.980]   to jobs, job opportunities, business opportunities, et cetera. And you can do that really intentionally.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.200]   So that's my basic model. Model number one is introspection. Model number two is external
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.360]   assessment. And model three is third party interaction. And,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.260]   that third party interaction feeds number one, number two feeds number one, et cetera.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.820]   And along the way you can try things. And then if you set up your personal finances in such a way
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.480]   and you expect, and you, you get yourself into a mindset of testing.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:16.520]   The idea is let me go and test this thing and, and limit, you know, especially if you're at a
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.440]   point where, okay, I'm thinking about buying a house or whatnot. If you know there's career
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.820]   changes coming up, what you want to do is you want to keep your outlay and your, your fixed expenses
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:30.860]   as modest as possible so that you have maximum flexibility. You have maximum flexibility to take
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.640]   a new job that's all on commission or start a new business where you may not make money for two years.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.740]   And then you want to keep your geographic flexibility as intact as possible as well.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.440]   So you can go across the country and work for someone for a couple of years, uh, in,
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.360]   in a certain business, and then you can come back and start another business. And then financially,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.800]   uh, especially if you have any tendency towards entrepreneurism, then it makes
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.260]   a lot more sense for you to keep your powder dry so that you can spend 200 grand on a business,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.140]   uh, getting a business going rather than 200 grand on a house. And so you want to keep as
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.220]   much money available. It's better to rent a tiny little apartment somewhere and get your business
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.420]   going. And then you come back in five years and when you're making half a million a year,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.460]   you can go ahead and buy the house that you actually want to be in. And so, uh, that's,
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.680]   that's the, how you integrate personal financial planning with the, the career search. But the
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.580]   testing model just simply says, don't, don't expect yourself to don't make a 30 year commitment
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:35.160]   to something. There's no way to know. Uh, you'll know vastly more after two months working in your
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:41.440]   industry than you will, uh, pre then you will without that two months there. This is why I
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:48.940]   have such a deep passion for helping young people to have jobs because a summer job or a Christmas
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:54.560]   break job or a Saturday job helps someone to have exposure to
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.820]   an industry that has a certain set of factors involved in it. And without any kind of long-term
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:06.620]   expectation that I have to do this for many years and spending a couple of weeks doing a certain
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.500]   business or doing certain job is enough to get a taste of it. That for a thoughtful person will
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.700]   inform your life decisions going forward for the rest of your life, based upon how much you liked
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.240]   it and how much you didn't like what you, what exactly you were doing at that point in time.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.600]   Thank you. Thank you. That is, uh, that's very helpful and very,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:35.180]   I felt like I knew some of those things, but just having you lay it out in that kind of sequential,
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:41.360]   very strategic way, it really does help to, uh, just kind of clarify the different steps in the
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   process. And, uh, that's one of the things that I've, I've been doing kind of, uh, a lot of
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:53.040]   introspection. I've realized that I don't exactly enjoy working from home as much as I thought I
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.320]   would. Um, and I've been doing a lot of introspection, but I've been doing a lot of
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.440]   introspection. Um, but I do like the flexibility that it, it affords. And so even thinking about
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.880]   that, I enjoy colleagues. I enjoy the office chatter and all the stuff that goes on when
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:09.160]   you're, you know, getting up and putting on some clothes to go into the office. But, um, I've also
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:16.540]   realized that productivity suffers at times when I'm in that kind of environment because, you know,
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.060]   there's just a whole lot of other things going on. So it's been helpful to kind of think through.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.100]   So I appreciate you, um, you sharing that with me and I look forward to,
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.880]   um, you know, whenever you decide to reshoot and reproduce that course, I think it'll be
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.800]   super helpful. Yeah. Thank you. And you're exactly right about that experience. And I share that with
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   you and finding that right fit, I think is important. The thing that I, the, the biggest
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:49.460]   negative right now for me in my business life is I feel very isolated and alone in the work that I do,
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:55.160]   uh, because my company is me and a couple of people that work with me on a casual basis,
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.600]   on a contract basis, et cetera. And so I miss that sense of camaraderie,
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.180]   miss that sense of being on a team, et cetera. I've told people on, I have no problem saying
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:08.020]   it publicly. If I, someone came along with the right job offer with the right, uh, with the
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:14.140]   right terms, the right industry, et cetera, I would seriously consider taking a job or getting
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.340]   involved in some other business different than what I'm doing simply because of that
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.380]   sense of camaraderie and teamwork. I don't, I don't like to be alone all the time,
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:30.000]   but on the flip side, what I would not give up is I would not give up my freedom. And so there's
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.100]   this, there's this delicate balance that I would have zero interest in working for a company where
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.280]   I'm required to be in the office between eight and five in this particular office every year.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.020]   And so I don't go and look for jobs because I want to maintain my flexibility. But the cool
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:49.220]   thing is when you realize that you can build more of it into your life. And so there are
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.200]   many jobs where you're on a team or many businesses and things that you can have where
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.420]   you're on a team, you're with a team, you have that sense of camaraderie, but you're not glued
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:03.840]   to an office chair during business hours and you still have the freedom and flexibility.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:13.260]   And, and if you, if you recognize that as the, as what you're looking for, then, uh, then you can
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.440]   plan for it. And if you're not yet qualified for a job that has that sufficient level of freedom,
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:25.380]   then you can qualify yourself for it. And I, the reason I am affirming what you're saying is I think
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:32.320]   for most people, this is the mixture that they're looking for. And I find that a big reason people
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:42.020]   retire unnecessarily is simply due to lack of control over their schedule. And that if they
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:48.980]   were in a position where they simultaneously have a sense of camaraderie working with other
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.420]   people, even if they're an independent work business, even if their own results are independent,
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.660]   right? They're an insurance agent, they're in an office, et cetera. Just having that sense of
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:03.700]   camaraderie with other people brings a big value to life, but simultaneously not having all of their
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:11.000]   movements and positions and what an hour is controlled. Adults should have sufficient
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.600]   freedom and autonomy that they can bring into their life and lifestyle, the necessary level
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.760]   of flexibility. And so if you can find,
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:24.220]   I think those are fundamental characteristics that lead to long-term happiness. In the corporate
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:30.960]   world, you can get there either with a corporation that has some flexibility worked in to it,
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:39.320]   or by being at a senior level in that corporation where you are in a role in which
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.480]   you are held accountable exclusively for your results. And that's the key. And so in order to
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.700]   get there, you have to be willing to bear the responsibility to be judged based upon your
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:54.680]   results, not based upon your time. So great stuff, Eric. I look forward to getting that course
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.620]   re-released. I've got several others in the pipeline before that, but I look forward to
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.240]   getting that out to you when I can. We move on to the great state of Montana. Welcome to the show.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.860]   How can I serve you today? Hey, Joshua. I had a question
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:18.180]   to get your thoughts on when you think it would be appropriate to either travel further or pay more
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:25.080]   a friend or someone from church or something like that in their business rather than going through
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.200]   a big box store or a large contractor or something like that?
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.460]   Are you talking about as an employee or somebody else has a job or has something that you want to
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:44.460]   buy or a service? Yeah, the latter, where would you go drive an hour to go to a dentist if someone
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.500]   is a friend when you had a dentist 15 minutes away? Or...
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:48.860]   Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:54.040]   Is it a dollar amount or a percentage of time and valuing how you would support a community
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:59.280]   member rather than going through the easiest or most convenient or cheapest option?
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:10.580]   That's a fascinating question. I don't know that... Let me think for a moment. I don't have
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.540]   a pre-prepared model or framework that could put a specific
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:25.160]   number on it, a specific number such as the amount of time it takes or the dollar amount,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:32.640]   et cetera. I don't have that particular framework created. But at its core, I think the level of
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:40.440]   motivation that you have for making that decision is going to go down to, number one, the amount,
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:47.280]   the deep level of your personal motivation to see some kind of change happen in the world.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:57.120]   Number two, the dollar amount or the impact of it. So if we recognize that when we spend money,
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:05.420]   that money is going to fuel certain things in the world. And when we make every buying decision,
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.980]   we're fueling either the world that we want to see or the world that we don't want to see.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:15.680]   And so your level of motivation to see the world changed is going to be your core thing.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.140]   And I think that could be different for any one of us.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:27.200]   Number two, it's going to come down to the dollar amount. To make an example,
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:35.880]   if you can contribute $5 to a superior economy with a great inconvenience, then you're not going
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.460]   to do that. On the other hand, when you're making significant decisions and you can contribute $500
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:47.600]   or $5,000 to a superior economy, then you are going to be willing to deal with the hassle,
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:55.260]   et cetera. And beyond that, I don't know that I have a model for it. Tell me more about your
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.020]   actions and the specifics of what you're thinking about.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:09.360]   Yeah. I guess two things I thought about. One was the dentist. I have a friend from church who,
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:16.720]   like I said, was a much further drive. And I have an established care that's much closer. And in my
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.900]   mind, it's...
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.400]   It's something where if it's someone that I'm friends with and someone part of a community
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:30.140]   that I belong to and that I care about, that it's just a simple thing for twice a year to drive
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:39.600]   maybe an hour to go do it. Or another thing that I thought about is I have another person that I'm
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.620]   somewhat friendly with. I mean, it's somebody that came over to help me finish the nursery
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.480]   at my house before my kid was born. So, you know, someone that's fairly close. And,
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.320]   you know, I'm just trying to figure out how to get them to do it. And one of the things that I've
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.720]   learned is that there's no one that's going to do it. So, you know, I'm just trying to figure out how
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.560]   to get them to do it. And I think it's a really important thing to be able to do it. And I think,
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.860]   you know, the biggest thing that I've learned from the past couple of years is that I'm really,
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.860]   really good at finding ways to get them to do it. And I think that's a really, really important thing.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.860]   And I think that's one of the things that I've learned is that you don't want to be doing it. And,
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:13.860]   you know, I've done it for a long time. And I think that's one of the things that I've learned is that
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.660]   it's really important to get them to do it. And I think that's the biggest thing that I've learned is
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:24.300]   really not to go through those people. But if it's someone that you're invested in seeing be
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.420]   successful, like, I guess, emotionally invested, it seems like it's appropriate, but I just don't
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:36.260]   know where, where do you draw the line? It's kind of why I call them. Right. Well, to both of those
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:40.580]   seem like to me, obvious things that you should do, meaning you should work with both of those
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:47.300]   people, because we need a sense of community around us just to back up from what is an economic
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:52.820]   system and what, what makes such a big difference. One of the great powers of modern economic systems,
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:58.100]   especially in the United States, or I assume that you're, you are one of the things that is so
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:08.220]   remarkable is we have figured out how to create a vibrant economy that allows untrusted persons to
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:15.980]   interact with one another freely and competently. And it was not always that way in ancient economies
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.420]   and in many cultures around the world.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:17.620]   Right.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:24.160]   The person that you're doing business with is much more important than, and you needed to have some
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.280]   kind of connection. They needed to be a part of your ethnic group or your religion or your
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:35.200]   community, et cetera, in order for you to do business with it, because there was no large,
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:42.360]   there was no larger sense of community to fall back upon. You had, this was your community. You
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.620]   didn't have a national government that you could depend upon. You had a king that stole tax money
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.100]   from you.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.040]   And use that to, you know, send your brother off to war somewhere on the other side of the,
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.080]   of the continent. And so you couldn't rely on the government. You could only rely on these people.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.660]   And so there was a strong tribal preference for whatever tribe that you're interacting with
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:08.580]   in the United States. At least when I was growing up in the eighties and nineties, that was not,
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.080]   that was not something we thought about. We all identified ourselves as Americans
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.020]   and that was it. And there was certainly an in-group preference for Americans,
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.980]   versus those people. But, you know, you didn't think much about it. Everyone was pretty much
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:30.920]   in the same way. And we all worked very hard to respect one another, not to, not to, to,
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:38.460]   to be very blanking on the word that means, you know, very accepting and not to compromise,
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.900]   et cetera, just to kind of find the neutral middle ground of everything. And so that,
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:50.000]   so there was a, this didn't feel necessary to build alternative economies. It didn't feel
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.400]   necessary to work with people that were within your group. It just felt like it was an opportunity
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.540]   to interact with others. And so you, the argument you would have made back in those days would have
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:05.280]   been, well, I go to my, this dentist and this, my dentist isn't a Christian. So it gives me a chance
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:12.360]   to preach the gospel to him instead of patronizing your Christian brother from your church. Now,
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:19.320]   world is gone. And so I don't think much about, I don't, I don't generally have much of a sense
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:27.760]   of American solidarity. Now we're fracturing in terms of our groups and, and as our national and
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.740]   state level governments become increasingly impotent, then the ability now to rely upon our
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:39.800]   tribe becomes much more significant. And so it's probably a healthy trend on the whole. It makes me
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.060]   sad because I really enjoyed that sense of,
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:50.840]   of American identity when it existed, but it's probably a healthy trend to focus more on your
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:57.120]   smaller local group and your, and your smaller local tribe than, than back then. And so I think
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:04.960]   the key is that by investing into relationships with your money, you are investing into people
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.460]   and you can see the direct outcome of it. And while you're not doing it to get something out of it,
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.040]   you are going to, when, when your time,
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.540]   when your time comes and your baby is in the hospital with a birth defect or your,
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.620]   you know, your, you need a bunch of trash hauled out of your backyard or whatever it is,
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:29.800]   it's the people in your life that are going to be the key for you. And so you could go to the
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.980]   dental clinic clinic where nobody knows you, but you're not going to make an impact on that guy.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.800]   Whereas if you go to the one where you know the guy, you're going to have a chance to deepen your
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.900]   relationship and you're going to prove that you spend your money, that you spend your money with
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:43.920]   those people. And so I think that's a really, really important thing to do. And so I think that's
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:43.980]   a really, really important thing to do. And so I think that's a really, really important thing to do. And so I think that's
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:49.220]   those you care about. And then similarly with the guy, your friend who is selling prime America,
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:53.020]   I mean, you could buy a life and it's just a light, it's a term life insurance policy.
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.740]   But you, why, why wouldn't you want the commission to go to somebody that you care about?
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:03.460]   Because that'll build the relationships on a deeper level. So to me, those things are very much
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:10.960]   worth doing. And, and then also just in terms of causes, things that you want to do. So
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.800]   when, when, when you're in a relationship with somebody, you're going to have a chance to do it.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.300]   And I just think about how much to share, but like things that are important to me is number one,
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:24.840]   if I can patronize somebody that I know, then, then in the first place, then I want to do that
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.680]   as assuming that they have a reasonable level of quality and whatnot, but more important, but,
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:35.100]   and, and that pays off in the long run because it can be really helpful and you have the chance
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.160]   to impact people. I'll give, I'll give an example, right? I have a chiropractor, a chiropractor is a,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.680]   um, a Christian from the church that I go to and good chiropractor. I take my family,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.160]   and et cetera. Well, COVID came and the chiropractor's business collapsed.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:55.920]   And so it gave me the chance to, uh, I prepaid, um, a significant number of chiropractic appointments
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.540]   because I had money and his business was collapsing. And that made a big difference
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:07.120]   in terms of the relationship. And on the flip side, the, the benefits that I get just from
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:13.300]   the personal relationship are far worth worth far more than going to somebody who's across the way.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.340]   I have this thing where I don't always want to actually pay the money, but I really do believe
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:24.020]   that we should be happy to pay more to our friends and our family for their businesses rather than
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.420]   expect discounts. Think about it. You have a friend that owns a restaurant and you say,
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.960]   oh, it's my friend's restaurant. We'll go there and, uh, and he'll give us a discount on the food.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.520]   Well, certainly that's his right. And it's appreciated when he does that. But my heart
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.200]   should be that I'm going to my friend's restaurant and I'm happy to pay extra, uh, because, and to
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.920]   make a big order because I want to see my friend's business succeed. And so to me, that's the proper
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.260]   mindset that we should have towards our friend and our family who are in business. And we should
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:55.140]   express that. The other thing I would just say is that if you want change to happen, you have to
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:03.300]   actually spend money. So things that I do, right, I go a significant way out of my way to go and
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:09.380]   purchase as much of my food as I can from an organic farmer's market rather than going to
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.080]   the grocery store. And the reason is that I want to see my friends and my family do the same thing.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:17.220]   I want to see more regenerative agriculture happen. And I want to see organic farmers where I
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:23.060]   know the, uh, the source of my food and my family's food, where I know where it comes from,
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.360]   rather than, than just wanting the cheapest deal. I want higher quality. And so that's something
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.580]   that I do that is pretty inconvenient. And yet to me, it's something that I want to do
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.840]   because these are people that I want to support. And I want to see more and more people join them
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.960]   in their agricultural practices, et cetera. The flip side is that it felt really good
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.260]   when I was worried about food security, uh, and famine and whatnot. And of course,
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.560]   I'm still concerned about it because there's various things that you can look at, but not as
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.760]   what doesn't seem as dire as it once did. We'll see what happens this year. But when I'm thinking
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.320]   about famine and worried about that for my family, I feel really good about the extra work that I go
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.580]   through to buy directly from my farmers who I'm their best customer. I buy a lot. I always pay a
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.160]   little extra more than what they, what they ask. So I know that I'm at the front of the line. If,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.520]   if food is short, I know that I'm at the front of the line with the food that they are able to
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.400]   produce, et cetera. And so it may come back to help me in the long run. So I don't have anything
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.800]   more. I don't have anything more, uh, uh, insightful to say other than that. I think
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   that we should do it. And why should we spend our money with people that hate us, uh, or hate what
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.400]   we believe or hate what we stand for or hate how we live? And why should we invest our money into
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.220]   companies that, that, that hate us? And I don't, I don't publicly, uh,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:48.660]   get involved in boycotts and whatnot, but I have a long list of companies that I avoid
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:55.860]   as much as I possibly can. Uh, and I avoid giving money to them because they despise me as a man.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.080]   And, uh, but I'm all, I'm also not a purist. I guess that would be the final thing I would say
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.240]   is that I'm not, I myself am not a purist about it because I think that being a purist about it
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:11.420]   can limit your overall effectiveness in life. Uh, and so, uh, there are compromises,
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:19.020]   that I make and that we all make. And to me, that sense of moral purity that we would all love to
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:26.160]   have is a juvenile, non-realistic perspective that we're going to do the best we can 80% of the time,
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:32.040]   but 20% of the time you're going to go, you know, if you need your teeth cleaned and you can't get
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.260]   over the cross town, then this time you're just going to go to the local dentist and get your
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.580]   teeth cleaned. Cool. I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:47.640]   It sounds like we're very similar in what we were thinking. Um, so I appreciate,
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:53.780]   you know, just hearing that and how you do it. My pleasure. I'll think more about it. And then,
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.780]   uh, but if you can do it, uh, patronize the people that, uh, that, you know,
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.480]   and the respect and build community. Cause at the end of the day, that's what we all need.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:06.920]   Anything else? Nope. That's it. Thank you. Great. And with that, we wrap up our call,
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.080]   just a short call today, two callers. If you'd like to join me on next week's call,
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.460]   this happens sometimes last week. We had a
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.640]   long line of callers and was, uh, was hustling to get through them. Uh, this week we had a short
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:22.040]   list of callers. So if you would like to join me next week, uh, go to patreon.com slash radical
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.480]   personal finance, patreon.com slash radical personal finance, sign up to, to, uh, support
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.780]   the show on Patreon and you will gain access to the Friday Q and a shows. In addition, I would
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:36.160]   remind you that I'm running an August sale on personal consulting. If you would like to work
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.340]   with me on a personal consulting basis, go to radical personal finance.com slash consult. And
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:45.160]   then got a good number of signups coming in for the Panama event. I need to check and see
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.300]   what the number is that we're at, but I know we still have spots. And so if you are available
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:56.060]   in January of 2023, come to Panama on a Panama investment tour with me, with my friend,
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:01.420]   Gabriel custodian and with my friend, Mikkel Thorup. Uh, it is going to be an amazing week
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:07.360]   together. We have an itinerary of classes planned. We have a bunch of, uh, events that are going to
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.320]   be great. We're going to be specifically profiling Panama, Panama's residency options,
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:16.680]   citizenship options, banking options, investment options. Uh, we're going to tour a gold storage
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.120]   facility. If you're looking for a place to put some of your bullion, et cetera, uh, it's going
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.460]   to be a great trip. And then beyond that though, we're just going to be hanging out. And so the,
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:32.580]   the, the ticket that you are buying is for the trip, but it's fine with me. If you just view
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.160]   it as a vacation and a networking event to come and spend time with us, we'll talk about
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.440]   other countries. We'll talk about global options, et cetera. It's going to be a great trip. So go to,
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:47.220]   go to expatmoney.com/radical expatmoney.com/radical to sign up for that event. And I look forward to
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.360]   saying, seeing you there.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:48.460]   Thank you.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.180]   Thank you.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:43:19.160]   Thank you.
