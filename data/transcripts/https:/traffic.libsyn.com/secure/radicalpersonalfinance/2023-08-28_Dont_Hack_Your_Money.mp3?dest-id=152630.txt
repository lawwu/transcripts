[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.280]   This coming January, I am co-hosting an event,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.320]   an investment tour of Panama.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.860]   And I would love for you to come and spend a week with me
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.600]   and with my friends, Gabriel Custodiate and Mikkel Thorup
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.100]   in Panama City, Panama.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440]   The dates of the event are January 22 to January 28, 2024.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.940]   And during that week in Panama,
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.820]   we are going to do a fairly widespread,
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.100]   comprehensive tour of Panama.
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.560]   We have a variety of conference presentations
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.100]   prepared, including specifics on the Panama lifestyle,
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.740]   on international banking, internationalization,
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.880]   taxation, et cetera.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.380]   We're going to do some specific presentations
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.300]   on cryptocurrency.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.060]   As you know, my co-host, Gabriel Custodian,
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.160]   I have a course on that,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.140]   and he's almost finished with a book on it.
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.360]   In addition to that,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.800]   we're going to tour real estate investment opportunities.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.880]   We are going to tour a gold storage facility.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.560]   We're going to discuss banking options,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.980]   residency options, citizenship options, et cetera.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.580]   And at the end of the day,
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.540]   we're going to be hanging out.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.880]   I'm going to be making myself completely available
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.900]   to those who are at the conference,
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400]   morning, noon, and night,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.380]   for the entire week that we're there.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.320]   And the conference attendees are limited to 40.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.160]   And so there will be plenty of time
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.260]   for you to hang out with me
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.420]   and with all of our fellow conference attendees.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.360]   If that sounds interesting to you,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.000]   please go to expatmoney.com slash radical,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.880]   link in the show notes,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   expatmoney.com slash radical,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.820]   and check out all the information
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.360]   on our Panama investment tour in January of 2024.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.520]   I'd love for you to come out there
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.780]   and see what's going to come.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.160]   Would love to see you there.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.980]   There is a piece of financial advice,
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.560]   as well as a corresponding mindset and philosophy
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.520]   that I myself have followed,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.680]   have taught,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.380]   and yet have now come to believe
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.500]   is not only wrong, misguided,
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.240]   but in many cases, actually harmful.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.220]   And I want to atone for my sins in this area
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.340]   by discussing it with you
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.240]   in the hopes that we can work together
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.860]   to avoid some of the problems
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.500]   that I have faced in my life.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.300]   I see happening around the world
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.400]   of personal finance today.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.120]   a show dedicated to providing you
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.540]   with knowledge, skills, insight,
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.500]   and encouragement you need
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.380]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.200]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.480]   in 10 years or less.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.820]   My name is Joshua Sheets,
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.420]   and I'm going to begin today's episode
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.600]   by reading a short excerpt from a book.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.960]   I'll tell you what book this is from
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.360]   in just a moment.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.100]   The most fundamental of American questions
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.700]   is hard for me to answer these days,
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.100]   and luckily so.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.120]   If it weren't,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.180]   you wouldn't be holding this book
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.480]   in your hands.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.920]   So, what do you do?
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.000]   Assuming you can find me,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.940]   hard to do.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.800]   And depending on when you ask me,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.220]   I'd prefer you didn't.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.420]   I could be racing motorcycles in Europe,
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.660]   scuba diving off a private island in Panama,
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.240]   resting under a palm tree
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.120]   between kickboxing sessions in Thailand,
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.600]   or dancing tango in Buenos Aires.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.940]   The beauty is,
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.780]   I'm not a multimillionaire,
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.560]   nor do I particularly care to be.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.480]   I've never enjoyed answering this cocktail question
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.120]   because it reflects an epidemic
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.460]   I was in when I was a kid.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.880]   I've never enjoyed answering this question
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.920]   because it reflects an epidemic
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.960]   I was in when I was a kid.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.980]   I've never enjoyed answering this question
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.000]   because it reflects an epidemic
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.660]   part of job descriptions
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.380]   as self-descriptions.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.400]   If someone asks me now
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.160]   and is anything but absolutely sincere,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.480]   I explain my lifestyle
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.500]   of mysterious means simply.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.160]   I'm a drug dealer.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.380]   Pretty much a conversation ender.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.080]   It's only half true, besides.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.260]   The whole truth would take too long.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.100]   How can I possibly explain
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.620]   that what I do with my time
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.500]   and what I do for money
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.220]   are completely different things?
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.580]   That I work less than four hours per week
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.980]   and make more per month
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.180]   than I used to make in a year?
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.800]   For the first time,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.620]   I'm going to tell you the real story.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.200]   It involves a quiet subculture
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.420]   of people called the new rich.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.120]   What does an igloo-dwelling millionaire
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.820]   do that a cubicle dweller doesn't?
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.580]   Follow an uncommon set of rules.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.820]   How does a lifelong blue-chip employee
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.520]   escape to travel the world for a month
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.800]   without his boss even noticing?
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.600]   He uses technology to hide the fact.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   Gold is getting old.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.480]   The new rich, and are,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.940]   are those who abandon the deferred life plan
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.420]   and create new life.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.280]   They create luxury lifestyles in the present
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.120]   using the currency of the new rich,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   time, and mobility.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.760]   This is an art and a science
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.600]   we will refer to as lifestyle design, LD.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.800]   I've spent the last three years
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.780]   traveling among those who live in worlds
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.360]   currently beyond your imagination.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.620]   Rather than hating reality,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.260]   I'll show you how to bend it to your will.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.840]   It's easier than it sounds.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.420]   My journey from grossly overworked
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.240]   and severely underpaid office worker
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.400]   to member of the industry
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.060]   is at once stranger than fiction.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.080]   And now that I've deciphered the code,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.740]   simple to duplicate.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.460]   There is a recipe.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.400]   Life doesn't have to be so hard.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.360]   It really doesn't.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.300]   Most people, my past self included,
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240]   have spent too much time convincing themselves
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.500]   that life has to be hard.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.780]   A resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.320]   in exchange for, sometimes,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.500]   relaxing weekends and the occasional
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.400]   keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.260]   The truth, at least the truth I live
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.200]   and will share in this book,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.920]   is quite different.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.000]   From leveraging currency differences
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.860]   to outsourcing your life and disappearing,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.040]   I'll show you how a small underground
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.700]   uses economic sleight of hand
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.720]   to do what most consider impossible.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.980]   If you've picked up this book,
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.100]   chances are that you don't want to sit behind a desk
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.880]   until you're 62.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.400]   Whether your dream is escaping the rat race,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.680]   real-life fantasy travel,
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.620]   long-term wandering,
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.580]   setting world records,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.880]   or simply a dramatic career change,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.980]   this book will give you all the tools you need
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.040]   to make it a reality in the here and now
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.980]   instead of in the oft-elusive retirement.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.100]   There is a way to get the rewards
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.340]   for a life of hard work
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.120]   without waiting until the end.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.980]   How?
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.940]   It begins with a simple distinction
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.900]   most people miss,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.480]   one I missed for 25 years.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.540]   And, dear audience,
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.300]   please pay attention
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.620]   because these are the two paragraphs
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.020]   that I want to focus on.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.300]   People don't want to be millionaires.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.380]   They want to experience
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.980]   what they believe only millions can buy.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.000]   Ski chalets, butlers,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   and exotic travel often enter the picture.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.820]   Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.900]   on your belly in a hammock
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.880]   while you listen to waves
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.940]   rhythmically lapping against the deck
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.940]   of your thatched-roof bungalow.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.240]   Sounds nice.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.300]   A million dollars in the bank
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.900]   isn't the fantasy.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.640]   The fantasy is the lifestyle
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.060]   of complete freedom it supposedly allows.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.620]   The question is, then,
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.520]   how can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.980]   of complete freedom
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.700]   without first having
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.280]   one million dollars?
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.960]   I first read those books,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.240]   excuse me,
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.440]   I first read those words
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.840]   in the year 2007
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.300]   sitting in a comfortable chair
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.800]   in Barnes & Noble bookstore
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.460]   in downtown West Palm Beach.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.800]   Bookstore is now gone
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.080]   as many bookstores are.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.300]   I was browsing through the bookstore
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.240]   during college
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.320]   and I stumbled across this book
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   called The Four-Hour Workweek
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.720]   by author Tim Ferriss.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.200]   And I found it before it got big.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.980]   I found it right when it had hit the shelves
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.600]   and I found the title so attractive
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.620]   I immediately opened up,
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.140]   read the entire book,
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.300]   and I found it right when it had hit the shelves.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.700]   The book's introduction
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.520]   and for what I would assume
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.780]   are fairly obvious reasons
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.660]   was hooked.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.920]   Ferriss is a phenomenal writer
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.060]   and his hooks are fantastic.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.640]   And this hook
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.040]   of living like a millionaire
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.380]   without having to be a millionaire
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.200]   was something that immediately
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.600]   made sense to me
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.380]   as the goal worth pursuing.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.200]   After all,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.860]   if I can live like a millionaire
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.060]   within the next few years,
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.280]   then why waste 30 or more years
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.940]   or 40 years becoming a millionaire?
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.640]   What's the point?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.880]   Why not just simply live like a millionaire?
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.180]   Well, it's a few years later now.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.940]   I guess technically 16
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.100]   as I record this podcast.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.200]   And I've realized that
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.360]   while there's an element of this
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.120]   that I do like and do practice,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.440]   there's also a great danger.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.020]   The great danger is that
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.640]   if you get accustomed to living like a millionaire
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.540]   and you lose your motivation
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.260]   to be a millionaire,
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:35.880]   you will never in fact become a millionaire
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.840]   because you did not become a millionaire.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.000]   Instead, you became somebody
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.380]   who thinks that they're cheating the system
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.520]   and living like a millionaire
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.000]   and you never become a millionaire.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.520]   One theme that has been very popular
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.340]   through all of my formative years
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.480]   has been the theme of
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.240]   hacking life.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.100]   I used to read a website and blog
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.520]   called Life Hacker.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.580]   This came out of computer culture
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.480]   with the word hacking,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.820]   meaning somebody who could
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.200]   go into a system
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.580]   and break all the rules
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.280]   and get in.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.760]   And then it became something
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.800]   that was applied to life.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.760]   We want to find little life hacks,
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.740]   which basically means
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.980]   clever little tricks
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.540]   that give you a little bit more bang
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.240]   for your buck.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.260]   But this was so omnipresent
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.440]   in my formative years
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.320]   that I kind of absorbed
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.200]   that this is obviously
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.060]   the right way to do it.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.040]   We should look for hacks.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.960]   We should look for ways
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.220]   to do things
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.680]   the fastest way possible.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.360]   And Tim Ferriss
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.260]   is perhaps the paragon of this.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.660]   He would write blog articles
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.220]   about how to learn a language
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.880]   in a tiny number of hours,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.480]   how to accomplish
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.000]   this extraordinary feat of life
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.440]   in a very short period of time.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.040]   He had a whole TV show
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.800]   that was dedicated
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.060]   to demonstrating
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.980]   how he was able
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.960]   to deconstruct
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.200]   certain activities
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.900]   and show people
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.240]   how to accomplish those things
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.460]   faster and better.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.020]   And to be clear,
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.380]   by the way,
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.580]   I hold no grudge
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.500]   against Tim Ferriss.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.200]   I admire him.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.980]   I admire him enormously.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.640]   We all of us
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.460]   go out in the world
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.800]   and share our message
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.620]   and our ideas.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.980]   And I would bet
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.540]   that today
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.560]   if Tim was going to go
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.460]   and write the four-hour week,
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.500]   he would probably write it
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.060]   very differently.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.820]   That's what we do.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.580]   And I like Tim.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.360]   He's a very smart guy,
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.240]   very useful, etc.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.760]   But this concept of hacking
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.520]   was so pervasive in my life
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.180]   and I didn't hear a voice
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:21.740]   of saying,
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.280]   hey, there's actually
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.780]   good reasons
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.660]   to do the opposite.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.360]   There's actually good reasons
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.180]   to do the opposite.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.720]   To do things
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.320]   the long,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.860]   laborious,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.440]   difficult way.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   I first began to realize this
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.000]   when I started thinking
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.720]   about my own children.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.420]   As a homeschooling father,
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.540]   I think
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.180]   an excessive amount,
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.100]   an inordinate amount,
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.640]   way too much
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.240]   about some of these topics.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.700]   And I'm always looking
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.320]   for ideas.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.520]   I'm looking for authors.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.420]   I read books nonstop about it.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.080]   I argue with
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.980]   anybody I can find
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.580]   with an opinion
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.260]   who's willing to defend
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:02.740]   that opinion.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.380]   I take it home.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.460]   I think about what they said
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.400]   and I construct my counter-arguments
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.380]   and refine and adapt
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.540]   my philosophy, etc.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.280]   And I've been doing this
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.960]   for years.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.200]   One of the things
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.160]   that I realized
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.980]   in thinking about education
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.460]   was the futility
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.400]   of hacking education.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.260]   Now,
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.880]   there are probably times
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.560]   and places
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.440]   in which hacking school
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.940]   is a good idea.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.300]   Some months ago,
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.140]   I talked about
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.000]   getting a college degree
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.100]   fast, easy, and cheap.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.980]   And that's worthwhile.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.660]   If you need a college degree,
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.020]   recognize you can go get one
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.980]   and fast, easy, and cheap.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.780]   Probably anybody of
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.840]   reasonable academic competence
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.080]   who recognizes
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.120]   that his life is hindered
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.440]   by not having a college degree
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.820]   could get one within a year
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.320]   using some of the strategies
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.080]   that I've outlined
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   and discussed elsewhere.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.260]   But one thing
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.740]   that has always been clear to me
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.840]   is that all you're doing
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.140]   in that instance
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.160]   is printing yourself
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.060]   a degree,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.160]   a diploma.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.720]   You're hacking the system
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.860]   so that you have a degree
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.620]   and a diploma.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.240]   And that can be useful
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.480]   because it may be a credential
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.720]   that opens something else
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.660]   up to you.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.400]   But what that does not give you
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.860]   is what many people
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.660]   actually want,
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.620]   which is the education.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.340]   And it's rather crazy
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.140]   that we live in a world
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.440]   in which we would ever
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.180]   make the choice
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.560]   to pursue the degree
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.420]   or the diploma
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.420]   rather than the education.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.100]   And as I thought a lot
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.560]   about child training,
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.400]   child raising,
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   education,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.800]   you know,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.040]   what's the principle of school,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.680]   how do you know
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.220]   you're well-educated, etc.,
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.920]   I came to the conclusion
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.940]   that in every area
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.140]   you're better off
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.500]   pursuing the long,
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.640]   difficult path
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.240]   that results in
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.800]   your actually being
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.980]   genuinely,
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.040]   thoroughly educated
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.180]   rather than being somebody
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.080]   who is well-credentialed,
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.520]   somebody who hacked the system.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.840]   Now, my own education
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.480]   was not a total hack.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.340]   But I've often reflected back
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.440]   and wished
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.660]   that I had done
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.700]   the harder work.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.820]   I did well in school myself.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.300]   Past high school, no problem.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.560]   I don't remember my GPA,
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.500]   but I was usually
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.840]   in the top of my class.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.080]   Not the very top,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.780]   didn't work that hard,
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.680]   but I was in the top ranks.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.020]   Did okay in college,
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.100]   just depending on the year
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.900]   and how much I partied
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.520]   versus how much
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.620]   I actually studied.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.540]   But when I thought back,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.720]   I wished that I had done it.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.020]   I wished that,
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.440]   and I still wish,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.480]   I wish I had read
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.780]   all the textbooks I was given.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.520]   I wish I had done
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.340]   all the homework.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.360]   I wish I had done more
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.460]   than I was assigned to do
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.540]   or required to do.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.400]   Where I most noticed this myself
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   was my senior year of college.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.000]   The only year
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.420]   of my own schooling
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.100]   that I ever actually did all the work
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.960]   was my senior year of college.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.120]   And that was because
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.200]   it was a year of intense
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.420]   personal growth for me.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.280]   At the time,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.540]   I was determined to get out of debt.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.040]   I decided I wanted to pay off
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.720]   all my student loans
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.360]   before I graduated from college.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.160]   I was doing my senior year
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.500]   of capstone courses,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.460]   the hardest courses,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.900]   and I was also working
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.920]   40 hours a week.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.560]   And the only way
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.240]   that I was able to make that work
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.660]   was to sit down with a calendar,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.580]   chart out all of my classes.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.980]   It took 19 hours of credit hours
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.260]   of class
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.060]   and my work times
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.320]   because I had to submit them to my boss.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.500]   Here's the time that I'm going to be working
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.540]   in order to make this work.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.020]   And in order to do that,
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.380]   I also had to put homework times
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.840]   and study times onto my calendar.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.220]   And I gave myself
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.080]   a little bit of free time.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.600]   As I recall,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.960]   I think I had two or three hours
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.840]   on Saturday evening.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.440]   I had Sunday morning free
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   and then I had till about
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.920]   two o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.200]   That was when I started doing homework
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.580]   was two o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.900]   And during my entire senior year,
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.340]   because I actually had a schedule
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.500]   that had homework time
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.940]   and I was committed to it,
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.960]   I was motivated for it,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.120]   I actually started doing
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.700]   all of the readings for class.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.860]   I read my textbooks.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.140]   I was prepared every single time.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.440]   And I had the most incredible
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.880]   year of college I have ever,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.080]   that I had ever had.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.580]   It changed everything.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.300]   Not only was college immediately easy,
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.660]   never had to study for a test
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.580]   because I just did the readings
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.120]   and we just went and take the test,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.280]   but I learned an enormous amount.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   The most amazing thing to me
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:25.860]   as a young man
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.580]   was that my teachers
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.520]   all of a sudden became
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:27.940]   very smart.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.440]   Previously,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.420]   I had been very critical
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.160]   of my teachers
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.680]   and I remember that
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.740]   in my senior year
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.240]   when I came to class prepared
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.360]   and I knew
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.600]   what was going to be discussed,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.200]   all of a sudden
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.580]   my teachers got a lot smarter
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.740]   and I gained a lot more
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.560]   from the classes.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.260]   And I got straight A's,
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.220]   not even an A minus
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.120]   across the board,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.240]   summer, fall, and spring
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.800]   of my graduating year of college.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.360]   And it made me reflect back
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.780]   and I thought,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.060]   why did I waste so much time?
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.160]   Why did I just get by
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:56.900]   getting the grades
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.820]   that I needed to get a diploma?
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.300]   Why didn't I actually study?
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.900]   Why didn't I actually learn this stuff?
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.140]   And to this day,
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.700]   I look back and
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.480]   don't worry,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.220]   I'm not about to cry.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.180]   It's just reality.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.980]   You look back and you think,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.320]   man,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.260]   if only I'd actually learned it
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.640]   when I had the time.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.020]   If only I'd done it.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.680]   Now let's move to finance.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.880]   I think the same exact thing
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.060]   happens in finance.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.500]   And I see it happening all around.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.660]   I realized,
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.340]   myself,
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.920]   that by focusing on short-term wins,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.260]   on living rich now,
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.920]   being a part of the new rich,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.640]   frequently what happens
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.460]   is you don't lay the groundwork
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.900]   for an enduring level of wealth.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.560]   Another example from
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.100]   the book,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.220]   The 4-Hour Workweek.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.300]   In a later part of the book,
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.600]   Tim Ferriss teaches people
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.700]   how to do what he calls
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.660]   dreamlining.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.180]   And dreamlining involves
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.880]   you laying out
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.320]   your dream ideal lifestyle
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.060]   and then putting in place
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.320]   a budget for it.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.740]   And if I went back
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.440]   through my old journals,
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.020]   I could find my own
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.800]   dreamlines of that time.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.820]   And Ferriss,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.680]   being a young man
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.880]   and writing to what ended up
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.800]   being a lot of young men,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.320]   was very consumeristic
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.340]   in his examples.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.900]   And he talked about how,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.120]   you know,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.480]   you don't have to be a millionaire
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.560]   to have a really great car.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:21.900]   You know,
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.940]   you can just determine
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.800]   the cost of these.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.340]   So from this chapter
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.120]   on dreamlining,
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.420]   where you define
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:27.860]   your goals,
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.180]   then you lay out
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.120]   kind of your dreams,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.620]   et cetera,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.700]   and then you determine
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.180]   the costs of these dreams
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:34.900]   and you calculate
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.760]   your target monthly income,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   your TMI,
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.700]   based upon your timelines.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.740]   Here's his words.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.240]   If financeable,
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.800]   what is the cost per month
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.280]   for each of the four dreams?
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.320]   Rent, mortgage,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:47.900]   payment plan,
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.880]   installments, et cetera.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.500]   Start thinking of income
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.160]   and expense
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.020]   in terms of monthly cash flow.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.980]   Dollars in and dollars out
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.580]   instead of grand totals.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.500]   Things often cost much,
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.120]   much less than expected.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.140]   For example,
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.940]   a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.200]   fresh off the showroom floor
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.500]   at $260,000
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.980]   can be had for $2,897.80 per month.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.860]   I found my personal favorite,
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.160]   an Aston Martin DB9
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.440]   with 1,000 miles on it
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:15.940]   through eBay
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.020]   for $136,000,
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.640]   $2,003.10 per month.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.680]   How about a round-the-world trip?
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.980]   Los Angeles to Tokyo,
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.800]   Singapore, Bangkok,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.700]   Delhi or Bombay,
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.940]   London, Frankfurt, Los Angeles
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.820]   for $1,300.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.440]   $399.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.760]   For some of these costs,
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.400]   the tools and tricks
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.480]   later in the chapter will help.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.280]   Last, calculate your target
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.060]   monthly income
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.720]   for realizing these dream lines
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.800]   and you lay out your income
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.560]   and figure out what's the total
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.320]   and then he says this,
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.500]   chances are that the figure
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.160]   is lower than expected
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.380]   and it often decreases over time
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.140]   as you trade more and more having
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.740]   for once in a lifetime doing.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.980]   Now I thought that was
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.040]   a really good way
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.100]   to handle life
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.540]   at the time.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.500]   And I pursued that
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.600]   in many, many regards
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.660]   and I've lived well
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.920]   and I'm grateful for living well
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.220]   because I made the best use
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.220]   of those years of my life.
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.460]   But here's the thing
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.780]   that I only realized later.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.260]   If you pursue dreamlining
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.220]   and you go out
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.940]   and here he was talking about
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.140]   buying a Lamborghini
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.780]   but let's just say
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.180]   you go out
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.300]   and you rent a Lamborghini
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.680]   to make my point clear.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.720]   You may be able to afford
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.860]   the monthly rental payments
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.980]   or lease payments
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.720]   or whatever it is.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.340]   But at the end of it,
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.780]   your life is going to be
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.220]   left with nothing.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.340]   If you bought the car,
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.940]   you're left with an old worn out car
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.820]   that's not worth much.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.840]   If you rented it,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.780]   you're left with nothing
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.200]   except the memories
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.740]   and the pictures
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.040]   and the experiences you had.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.940]   But if you went out
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.580]   and became wealthy first,
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.980]   you went out
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.700]   and became a multimillionaire
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.260]   and then as a result,
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.800]   you bought yourself
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.220]   the car that you wanted.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.020]   At the end,
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.500]   when that car is dusty
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.300]   and old and dilapidated,
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.460]   you're still a millionaire
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.400]   and you can go buy another one
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:57.760]   or any other car
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.940]   or anything else that you want.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.760]   Sounds obvious when you say it,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.140]   but here's what I later learned.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.060]   Sometimes,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.060]   the things that you do
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.920]   to pursue the Lamborghini lease payment
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.340]   on a target monthly income
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.780]   results in you're not doing the things
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.460]   that you need to do
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.660]   to become a multimillionaire.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.820]   Not always.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.160]   Perhaps there are many people
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.020]   who can do both.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.580]   I've tried to do both
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.180]   and I've learned to do both.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.740]   But if you have to choose between them,
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   don't choose the instant gratification.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.260]   Choose the hard path.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.860]   If you focus on becoming
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.660]   in its fullest essence
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.880]   the kind of person that you want to be,
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.940]   and if you focus on becoming
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.820]   the kind of person
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.480]   who has the dreams and the goals
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.880]   and the ambitions that you have,
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.480]   then it becomes easy
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.720]   for the rest of time.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.880]   Whereas if you play
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.380]   at being that person,
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.300]   you're basically,
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.400]   in many cases,
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.800]   dooming yourself
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.300]   to a lifetime
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.720]   of want.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.380]   Let me give a different example.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.880]   Also, when I was in college,
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.680]   I read a book called
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.520]   The Game
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.320]   by Neil Strauss.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.780]   Neil Strauss is a very enjoyable author to read.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.920]   He wrote this book called The Game.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.400]   The Game was a game
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.100]   or something like that.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.760]   The Game was a
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.360]   game
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.620]   basically a story
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.840]   of his experience
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.420]   of becoming
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.540]   a so-called
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.700]   pickup artist.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.480]   Pickup artist is defined
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.320]   as a man
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.340]   who goes out
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.760]   and interacts
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.780]   with lots of women
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.760]   with the goal
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   of picking them up.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.080]   Engaging in normally
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.220]   a sexual relationship
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.220]   may or may not be
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.000]   some romantic relationship involved.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.860]   But the ideal
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.640]   or the vision
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.380]   or the dream
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.340]   that is shared
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.820]   about somebody
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.220]   who is a successful pickup artist
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:53.960]   is a man who has
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.600]   a lot of women,
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.000]   many sexual partners,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.320]   and has
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:57.860]   it easily
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.900]   without a lot of commitment,
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.340]   et cetera,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.040]   and is constantly
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.580]   accumulating more
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.520]   and more sexual partners.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.700]   And I was super interested in this.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.820]   I read The Game.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.260]   I read other books
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.620]   and I bought courses
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.060]   and whatnot.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.640]   I was interested.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.340]   I learned about all the things
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.120]   about how to become
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.900]   a pickup artist.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.980]   And as I was reading it,
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.620]   one of the things
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.320]   that I noticed
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.300]   is that there were
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.300]   a lot of tactics
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.380]   and techniques
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.540]   that were being taught.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.060]   Teaching tactics
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.580]   and techniques
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.480]   is not always wrong.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.100]   But let me give
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.140]   a few examples
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.080]   from
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.840]   the world
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.160]   of pickup artistry.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.560]   As pickup artists,
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.000]   at the time,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.460]   I have no idea.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.400]   I have not followed this space.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.440]   I have no idea
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.760]   what the pickup artists
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.400]   today are teaching.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.180]   This is 20,
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.380]   almost 15 years ago.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.400]   20 years ago.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.680]   But at the time,
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.200]   one of the things
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.400]   that was super common
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.180]   is they would talk about
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.500]   how you approach a woman.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.260]   And the thing
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.260]   that became very famous
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.500]   because it really angered women
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.560]   when they would write about it
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.440]   was what they would call
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:49.880]   at the time
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.480]   the neg.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.300]   The neg short for negative.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.380]   And basically,
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.800]   it was a technique
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.540]   that a man would use
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:56.840]   to
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.800]   throw a woman
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.540]   off her balance
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.080]   a little bit
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.740]   by engaging in a
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.680]   somewhat gentle insult
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.920]   when she wasn't
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.580]   the kind of woman
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.440]   who was used
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.260]   to being insulted
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.160]   or used to feeling
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:07.840]   self-conscious.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.700]   And in theory,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.760]   this was supposed to
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.800]   open up the opportunity
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.260]   to make them,
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.160]   I can't remember,
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.100]   open up a conversation
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.240]   or whatever it wound up being.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.820]   And I always think of this
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.660]   as like a technique.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.780]   This is one of those things
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.540]   that you can practice.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.300]   And how can you
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.000]   give a backhanded compliment
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.020]   that actually turns out
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.580]   to be negative
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.340]   in order to
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.040]   throw a woman
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.860]   off of her balance
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.380]   a little bit?
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.080]   In hindsight,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.060]   I look at this and I say,
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.500]   this is,
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.440]   what a stupid
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.000]   way to live.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.240]   What a stupid way
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.520]   to interact with life.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.780]   To be
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.960]   a guy
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.880]   who's not successful
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.380]   with women
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.360]   and then go out
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.700]   and try to
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.920]   accumulate a set
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.460]   of tactics
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.300]   and techniques
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.880]   and then exercise
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.540]   those tactics
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.100]   and techniques.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.360]   Now,
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.780]   I should hasten to mention
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.540]   that it's not all stupid.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.200]   So for example,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.000]   one of the classic things
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.780]   of pickup artistry
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.640]   is that you have to
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.560]   approach a lot of women.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.080]   And a lot of times,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.880]   the guys who are
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.360]   struggling
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.240]   in this area
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.960]   are those who lack
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.620]   self-confidence
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.640]   and over time,
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.600]   you build self-confidence
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.560]   and it can lead to
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.080]   you becoming
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.960]   a more confident person.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.720]   But there's another way,
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.180]   right?
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:06.860]   The other way
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.640]   is you could just
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.860]   simply ignore women.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.660]   You could build
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.220]   yourself
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.580]   into the kind of man
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.640]   that women
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.740]   want to be with
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.400]   and then
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.520]   you don't need
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.860]   much technique at all
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.840]   as long as
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.560]   you're the kind of person
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.460]   that women want to be with
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.480]   because you become
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.180]   the guy that they
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:22.960]   want to be with
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.560]   and then you don't have
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.300]   to bother with any
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.360]   tactics or techniques.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.960]   And this is true
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.980]   in so many areas of life.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.060]   And as I've developed
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.680]   my work here
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.620]   at Radical Personal Finance
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.240]   over the years,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.100]   I've realized
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.480]   this is what annoys me
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.460]   about what I used
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.000]   to be into
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.900]   with finance
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.560]   is that by looking
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.120]   and focusing
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.040]   for the tip
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.840]   or the technique
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.880]   or the little thing,
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.140]   you wind up
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.660]   missing out
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.380]   on the big picture.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.420]   And in reality,
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.480]   I feel often
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.300]   like frustrated.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:48.620]   It's like,
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:48.920]   Joshua,
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.780]   why do you talk so much
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.840]   about making more money
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.420]   or meaning income?
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.540]   Why do you talk so much
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.480]   about savings rates
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:54.780]   and whatnot?
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.300]   Well, it's because
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:55.880]   that's what we need
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.900]   to spend 80%
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.640]   of our time on.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.800]   And we need to not look
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.520]   for the technique
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.220]   or the tactic,
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.460]   the super mega
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.460]   backdoor Roth IRA
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.340]   or any of that stuff.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.540]   We need to focus on
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:05.820]   first,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.300]   you're becoming
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.040]   the kind of guy
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.420]   who can have the money
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.460]   to fully fund
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.900]   a mega backdoor Roth IRA.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.340]   But I used to be obsessed
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:13.860]   with the tips
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.400]   and the techniques
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:14.960]   and the tactics
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.920]   and then I realized
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.300]   that if you just do
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.100]   the hard work,
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.200]   everything's simple.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.400]   If you just make,
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:20.940]   you know,
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.160]   $400,000 a year,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.100]   everything is simple.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:23.940]   How do you make
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.120]   $400,000 a year?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.580]   Well,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.040]   if you develop
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.360]   highly valuable skills
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.000]   in the marketplace
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.360]   and you do it the hard way
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.140]   by building those skills,
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:31.740]   learning them,
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.660]   exercising them,
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.440]   having a proven game plan
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.160]   and track record,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.600]   et cetera,
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.100]   then you become a guy
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.220]   who's worth $400,000.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.200]   And once you're worth
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.700]   $400,000 genuinely
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.520]   in the marketplace,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.120]   then you're kind of
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:44.920]   worth that forever.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.480]   And then your financial
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.500]   problems are solved.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.880]   So I don't mean
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.880]   to sound insulting
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.340]   or something,
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.540]   but I just look back
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.740]   and I think of my foolishness.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.880]   How did I not see that?
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.920]   Why did I not understand
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.400]   that the way
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.220]   that the hard way
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.420]   is actually the better way?
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.080]   If I reflect back,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.540]   getting things fast and easy
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.220]   in many cases
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.020]   actually kept me
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.140]   from doing the real work
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.980]   that was necessary.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.680]   Let me use another few examples
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   to put this into more
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.280]   of current day focus.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.020]   I've watched,
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.280]   super interesting to me,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.540]   over the last,
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.900]   I would say two years,
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.820]   we have developed
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.740]   a language
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.920]   around the brain
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.540]   that is so chemical
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.440]   of dopamine.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:27.880]   People talk about
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.380]   doing a dopamine detox.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.720]   People talk about doing,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.300]   having a dopamine addiction.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.320]   And I'm no brain scientist.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.560]   I'm happy to concede
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.360]   that this is a perfectly
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.440]   useful way of
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.020]   going through life.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.460]   But one of the things
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.580]   that a lot of guys realize
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.620]   is that they have
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.140]   a dopamine addiction
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.240]   and the addiction
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.120]   is to cheap fixes
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.480]   or cheap dopamine,
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.520]   unearned dopamine.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.600]   And so the classic examples
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.900]   is our phone.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.740]   We pull out our phone.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.820]   We get a dopamine hit
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.240]   going on social media.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.300]   Men get a dopamine hit
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.120]   from pornography.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.920]   You get a dopamine hit
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.720]   from doing some
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.900]   cheap and easy thing
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.940]   that makes you feel good
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.560]   all of a sudden.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.340]   But then when you close
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.680]   the cheap and easy thing down,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.200]   you're left without
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.080]   any real lasting dopamine.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.200]   And you didn't do anything
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.800]   to earn it.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.960]   And so you wind up
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.840]   just going back
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.960]   to that place for the hit.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.860]   And you're like
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.180]   any other drug addict.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.320]   You're a dopamine addict.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.740]   And you just,
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.620]   need another hit,
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.180]   need another hit,
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.740]   need another hit,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.360]   need another hit.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.600]   And you don't ever wind up
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.060]   with anything that endures.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.600]   You don't wind up
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.140]   with a lifestyle that endures.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.300]   And on basically every level,
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.500]   unearned dopamine,
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.980]   meaning where you got it
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.560]   because it was easy and cheap.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.720]   You consumed fast food.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.940]   You used pornography.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.160]   You stared at YouTube
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.880]   unceasingly.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.520]   You get the dopamine hit,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.180]   but it ruins the rest of your life.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.200]   And if you flip it around
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.640]   and you do it the hard way,
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.140]   and you go and you say,
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.420]   I'm going to earn my dopamine.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.420]   You know, you do a dopamine detox.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.400]   And then you earn your dopamine
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.280]   through effort.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.360]   Then you create a virtuous cycle
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.320]   in the other direction
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.160]   where you start to train your brain
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.020]   to hit that experience,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.020]   hit that chemical
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.120]   off of genuine love and connection,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.940]   genuine hard work,
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.560]   genuine exercise high,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.560]   whatever the expression of it is.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.280]   And the cool thing about it
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.320]   is you get the feelings
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.720]   that you want in the here and now,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.260]   but then you get the lifetime
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:24.740]   of feelings.
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.400]   And that's what makes you
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:25.480]   the person you want to be.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.520]   So I no longer embrace
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.400]   the thinking of
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.200]   how can I get this fast and easy?
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.160]   But I guess,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.480]   let me be honest.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.960]   It is my ambition
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.360]   to not be the kind of guy
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.500]   who embraces the thinking
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.260]   of how can I get this fast and easy.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.780]   It is my ambition
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.840]   to be the kind of guy
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.600]   who thoroughly and genuinely says,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.060]   how can I do something the hard way?
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.300]   How can I do something the real way?
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.080]   The hard way is the right way.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.040]   The hard way works reliably.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.680]   Hacks, shortcuts don't always work.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.540]   When they work,
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.840]   they don't always keep working.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.840]   Whereas the hard way works reliably.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.620]   Just the simple comments
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.700]   I've said so far in this podcast.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.680]   If you become the kind of person
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.860]   who is worth a high salary
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.560]   because you bring very valuable skills
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.860]   to the marketplace,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.700]   it's going to be relatively
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.180]   easy for you to command
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.460]   a high salary
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.140]   because you will have people
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.300]   who want you.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.100]   Whereas if you're not
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.740]   the kind of person
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.580]   who is worth a high salary,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.520]   then when you get one,
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.440]   you feel like you're an imposter.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.040]   It affects your productivity
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.620]   and your output.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.720]   And if you can't bring results,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.320]   then pretty quickly,
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.420]   your salary goes away
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.320]   and it's damaging to you.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.480]   So it's in the other way.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.000]   The hard way works reliably
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.540]   in anything.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.520]   If you're the kind of guy
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.980]   who is attractive to a woman,
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.660]   genuinely,
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.060]   thoroughly,
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.260]   on every dimension.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.740]   You have the personality
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.080]   characteristics and traits.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.440]   You have the character
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.660]   that is attractive to her.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.360]   You have the looks
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.240]   that are attractive to her.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.480]   You have the features,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.120]   the money,
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.040]   the status,
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.660]   the position,
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.400]   whatever it is
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.180]   that's attractive to her.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.480]   If you develop those things
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.120]   the hard way,
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.620]   you don't need any tricks.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.280]   Straightforward.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.080]   And it's you.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.900]   It's authentically,
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.660]   genuinely you.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.980]   So you don't have a sense
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.060]   of being an imposter.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.980]   The hard way works reliably.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.620]   In addition,
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.560]   the hard way scales
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.960]   and compounds.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.460]   Hacks don't.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.920]   What happens is
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.140]   you have to trade them in
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.220]   one for another.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.060]   I'll give you a current day example.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.740]   I have been a proponent
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.280]   of the concepts
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.100]   of internationalization.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.240]   The idea being that
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.760]   choose different countries
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.660]   that serve your goals,
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.380]   your lifestyles,
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.140]   your needs, etc.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.380]   I continue to be a proponent
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:51.920]   of that.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.280]   One of the things
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:54.580]   that I've been doing
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:54.940]   that I've observed
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.960]   by being around
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.160]   this space
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.560]   is there is a subset
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.580]   of guys,
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.300]   mostly I follow guys
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.800]   and I watch the guys do it.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.960]   There's a subset of guys
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.020]   who are living in a place
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:07.960]   like the United States
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.640]   or a place like
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   the United Kingdom, etc.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.440]   And all of a sudden
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.240]   they realize,
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.000]   you know what?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.180]   I could live well
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.820]   and live cheaper
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.600]   somewhere else.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.940]   I don't need to live
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.840]   on $4,000
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.580]   or $5,000
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.920]   or $7,000 a month
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.780]   in New York
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.660]   or Miami
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.720]   or Orlando
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.560]   or California.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.180]   Nashville
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.460]   or wherever they happen to be.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.500]   Instead,
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.520]   I can go to Latin America
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.800]   and I can live like a king
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.300]   on $1,500 a month
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:32.900]   in Colombia
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.480]   or Panama
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.060]   or wherever.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.100]   And so they quickly
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.860]   go and do that.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.540]   Some of them
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.120]   use that kind of activity
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.380]   as a launching pad.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.840]   They use the fact
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.300]   that they can live now
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.840]   on $1,500 a month
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.660]   to allow
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.440]   and they previously
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.920]   they needed $6,000 a month.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.240]   Now,
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.340]   it allows them to save
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.780]   $4,500 a month
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.660]   and they keep on going.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.520]   But it feels
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:54.960]   to me
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.600]   from watching
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:55.940]   and listening
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.560]   to a lot of guys
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.020]   that there's a significant
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   percentage of people
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.800]   who do that
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.280]   who then
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.860]   become the kind of guy
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.460]   who just
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.300]   makes $1,500 a month
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.560]   because I can live
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.560]   on $1,500 a month
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.520]   and I can live the good life.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   After all,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.260]   here I am
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:10.920]   having the barbecue
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.560]   on the beach
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.980]   living well.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.120]   I don't need much money.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.140]   I'm just living well.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:15.880]   Life's good, man.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.520]   Life is life.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.220]   Life's good.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.780]   But what can frequently happen
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.540]   is the guy left
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.520]   when he was 23
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.200]   goes and does it
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.500]   for 10 years.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.660]   At 33,
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.700]   he's completely
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.640]   fallen behind
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.260]   and he finds himself
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.160]   frozen out
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.000]   of all the things
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.960]   that his peers are doing.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.020]   He's missed out
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:38.940]   on a decade
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.880]   of compounding skills,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.580]   compounding certifications,
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.740]   compounding usefulness
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.300]   in the workplace.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.420]   He's missed out
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.060]   on a decade
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.400]   of compounding money
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.500]   from his investments growing
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.460]   and his income growing,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:50.940]   et cetera.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.800]   And so now,
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.980]   he's worried about inflation.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.520]   All of a sudden,
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.220]   his particular
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.220]   country that he chose
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:55.660]   is going through
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.760]   an inflationary spiral
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.920]   and he's all upset.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.120]   Well,
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.440]   what about the ratio
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.280]   of the Mexican peso
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.000]   to the dollar
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.120]   and all the rest
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.720]   of this stuff?
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.200]   Where if he had just
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.960]   been a bit patient
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.480]   or been thoughtful
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.580]   about how he applied
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.400]   these things
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.800]   and done things
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.540]   the hard way,
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.100]   then he wouldn't
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.620]   need that.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.440]   He wouldn't need
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:18.940]   to be worried
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.320]   about the inflation rate
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.100]   because he did it
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.780]   the real way.
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.100]   And his investments,
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.800]   and his income
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.740]   are far exceeding
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:26.620]   the pace of inflation.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.100]   Now notice,
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.840]   I'm not trying
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.060]   to be prescriptive
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.700]   of what any one
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.400]   person should
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.040]   or should not do.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.560]   I'm not saying
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.460]   that he shouldn't leave
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.160]   New York
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.480]   and move to Bogota
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.800]   or that he should leave
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.080]   New York
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.700]   and go to Bogota.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.040]   Again,
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.100]   it can be either way.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.920]   But the mindset
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.240]   of the guy doing it
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.200]   is what matters.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.280]   Is he looking for
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.440]   an opportunity
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.420]   to get ahead faster
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.380]   but he's still doing
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.040]   the hard work
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.580]   or he's looking
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.420]   for a hack?
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.640]   Because the hard way
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640]   scales and compounds
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   and hacks don't.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.720]   You have to go
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.540]   from one country
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.120]   and then you've got to go
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.020]   for a cheaper country.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.820]   And next thing you know,
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.380]   you're in a place
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.980]   that you don't want to be.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.900]   And you wake up
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.580]   and you're looking
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.140]   at your friend
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.160]   who's living in a mansion
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.000]   and you're saying,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.860]   how did you do that?
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.500]   Well,
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.960]   this stuff compounds.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.460]   The hard way,
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.120]   doing things the hard way,
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.520]   allows you to become
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.620]   a different person
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.620]   in the fullness of time.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.640]   You become a different person.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.480]   Whereas sometimes
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.680]   hacks
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.700]   transform you
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.980]   into the wrong
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.540]   kind of different person.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.220]   They transform you
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:35.980]   into the kind of guy
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.260]   who looks for a hack.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.800]   The hard way leads
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.160]   to your having pride,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.180]   satisfaction,
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.240]   and real self-confidence.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.800]   It's funny to me
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.960]   that in the English language
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.320]   we have,
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.060]   multiple uses
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.360]   and meanings of the word hack.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:56.920]   And some of them,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.040]   like other interesting
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.660]   English words,
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.760]   are the completely
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.480]   opposite meaning.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.760]   So for example,
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.340]   if I say,
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.240]   he's a hacker
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.140]   or he hacks life
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.040]   or he's a life hacker
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.180]   or he's got a great hack,
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.300]   that has a completely
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.660]   wildly different meaning
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.220]   from my saying,
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.980]   he's a total hack
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.400]   or he just hacked that job.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.920]   And yet,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.280]   is it really so
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:23.700]   different?
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.140]   Is there not a reason
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.280]   why we have the term
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.740]   he's a total hack
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.820]   and it uses the same meaning?
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.320]   So here's my summary.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.540]   Choose carefully
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.340]   the things that you
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.120]   commit to doing.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.560]   Choose them
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.500]   because they're
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.440]   important to you.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.000]   Choose them because
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.660]   they represent
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.580]   your ambitions,
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.060]   your goals.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.120]   Choose carefully
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:49.720]   the things
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.380]   that you want to do.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.160]   Choose carefully
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.360]   the things that you commit
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:54.860]   to doing.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.380]   And then
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.420]   commit
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.740]   to them
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.400]   all the way.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.580]   Don't just say,
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.600]   I'm going to dabble in them,
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.580]   but commit to them.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.040]   If you want to
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.280]   live a wealthy lifestyle,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.000]   commit to becoming wealthy.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.740]   And when you see
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.320]   the opportunity
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.400]   to live well now,
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.640]   I don't think that's harmful
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.020]   as long as you maintain
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.860]   that commitment
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.620]   to becoming wealthy.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.400]   If you want to
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.300]   learn another language,
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.820]   don't try to do a hack.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.040]   Commit to learning
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.840]   the language.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.860]   Now, when you have
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.360]   the opportunity
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:25.940]   to speed up
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.580]   your learning curve,
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.140]   certainly,
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:27.680]   there's not
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.620]   generally anything
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.260]   wrong with it,
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.340]   but don't look
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.080]   for the hack.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.180]   Look for
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.420]   the genuine acquisition
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.000]   of it.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.720]   So I,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.400]   for example,
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.800]   you've heard me
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.500]   in public comment,
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.040]   people ask me
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:40.660]   how to learn a language.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.480]   First thing I say is
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.240]   it's a multi-thousand
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.180]   hour project.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.420]   So don't,
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.520]   don't think it's anything else.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.260]   It's a multi-thousand
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:47.840]   hour project.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.380]   Commit to,
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.100]   how can I get
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.040]   those thousands of hours?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.180]   And then at the other end,
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:51.880]   you'll have so much
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.500]   self-confidence
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:52.980]   because you,
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.380]   you know,
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.120]   this ability that I have
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:55.720]   is earned.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.480]   And if you've chosen
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.780]   carefully the things
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.180]   that you commit to doing
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:00.860]   and you're committed
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.500]   to them,
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.160]   does it really matter
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:03.960]   how quickly
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.760]   you learn?
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.600]   Why?
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.620]   What do you have
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.740]   in life except time?
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.160]   Why do you want
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.760]   the results so fast?
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.400]   What's the point?
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.620]   You have the time
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:22.860]   and,
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.120]   and something worth doing
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.040]   is worth doing
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.460]   because it's important to you.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.520]   So go ahead
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.820]   and just do it.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.920]   And if it takes you
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.960]   more time,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.520]   do it.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.000]   I think often
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:37.620]   one of the reasons
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.160]   we try to do things fast
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.980]   is we don't understand
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.320]   that the balance of time
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.300]   that's necessary
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.740]   is,
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.100]   it's not that,
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.920]   meaning the amount of time
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.460]   that's necessary
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.260]   to genuinely do something well
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:52.800]   is not,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.180]   is not that much more
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.220]   for a much higher level.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:56.900]   Let me use the,
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.880]   the language example.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.820]   Let's say that you're
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.780]   choosing a language
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.500]   and let's say that it'll take you
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.700]   a thousand hours
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.680]   to,
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.300]   to genuinely
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.760]   be competent
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.420]   and comfortable
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.080]   in that language
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.160]   to have very high levels
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:10.620]   of understanding.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.620]   Obviously any language
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.960]   in the fullness of time
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.600]   you're gonna need thousands
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.580]   and thousands of hours
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.200]   to have the highest expression of it.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.360]   But let's assume that
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:17.620]   it's gonna,
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.020]   it's a thousand hour project.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.520]   Having learned some languages,
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.740]   having taught some languages,
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.180]   having,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.560]   having studied this out
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.320]   very deeply,
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.820]   what's interesting to me
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.320]   is there's a,
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.080]   there's just an overwhelming difference
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.700]   between your skills and ability
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.120]   at say four or five hundred hours
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.900]   in a language
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.600]   as compared to your skills
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.540]   and ability at say
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.460]   a thousand hours
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.200]   in a language.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.460]   There's an overwhelming difference
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.240]   in,
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.180]   in your confidence,
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:44.420]   your,
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.200]   your comfort,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.180]   your fluency,
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:46.480]   just,
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.380]   just your ability.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.440]   There's a huge difference
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.140]   between those.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.720]   Now,
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.160]   the guy who's hacking
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.800]   the language
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.860]   is gonna look at it and say,
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.240]   if I can achieve
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:55.880]   this,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.900]   speaking this language
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.820]   and call myself fluent
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.700]   in five hundred hours,
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.880]   why would I not,
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.960]   why would I wanna do
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   a thousand hours in it?
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.860]   Why not just go on
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.540]   to something else?
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.620]   Well,
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.580]   my answer would be number one,
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.360]   there's an overwhelming difference
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.840]   between being the kind of guy
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.860]   who can get by
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.060]   with five hundred hours of work
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.360]   versus genuinely being comfortable
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.020]   and confident
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:15.540]   and fluent
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.180]   in a thousand hours of work.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.840]   There's a huge difference.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.860]   But in the fullness of time,
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.140]   there's a huge difference
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.600]   The difference in time
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.200]   between your five hundred hours
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.860]   of investment
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.940]   and a thousand hours
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.580]   of investment
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.060]   is not actually
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.840]   that much time.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.020]   So,
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.780]   if you've decided
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.480]   to learn Spanish
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.120]   and you put in five hundred hours
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:35.760]   over the course of,
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:35.900]   say,
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.580]   two years,
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.140]   well,
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.480]   another two years
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.760]   will bring you
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.780]   to a much higher level
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.360]   of fluency.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.220]   And if you start learning Spanish
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.680]   when you're twenty-one years old
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.340]   and you've reached
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.440]   that very high level
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:48.920]   of fluency
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.140]   at the age of twenty-five,
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.180]   you may have
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.120]   another seventy-five
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:52.960]   years in which
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.580]   you can enjoy
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.620]   that level of fluency.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.260]   And what's amazing
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.480]   about something like language
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.040]   is that once you reach
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.720]   that high upper intermediate
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.760]   low advanced stage
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.460]   of language learning,
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.480]   it pretty well sticks
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.280]   with you for life,
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.000]   even if you have
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.180]   minimal use of it.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.900]   And so,
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.000]   the twenty-five year old
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.360]   who really invests the time
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.480]   and reaches a high level
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.560]   of fluency in the language
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.460]   may just stop
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.720]   for a decade.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.280]   And then he comes back
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:17.480]   and says,
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:17.760]   you know what,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.440]   I'm going to brush up
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:18.960]   my Spanish.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.100]   And in a few years,
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:20.540]   sorry,
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.300]   a few hours,
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.100]   a few tens of hours,
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.000]   very quickly,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.340]   it's back in place.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.560]   But if you stop
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.680]   at that lower level
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.560]   of language acquisition,
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.640]   you put in three hundred hours,
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.420]   you got through it,
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.440]   you kind of packed
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.200]   your way through it
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.140]   and figured it out,
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.100]   then you quit
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.600]   for a decade
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.320]   and come back,
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.840]   you're going to be starting
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.800]   from a much further
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.620]   back place.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.240]   Now with wealth,
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.580]   this is even more clear.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.440]   This is even more powerful.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.020]   When you sit down
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.560]   with a chart
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.180]   and you chart out
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:47.800]   your income,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.640]   you chart out
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.280]   your investments,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.600]   if you put in
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   that decade,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.960]   that two decades
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.920]   of hard work
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.360]   and wealth accumulation,
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:55.860]   et cetera,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.480]   and you're committed
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.820]   to being the person
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.100]   who is a multimillionaire,
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.220]   not just running out
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.540]   and renting a Lamborghini,
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.740]   then you get to enjoy it
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.260]   for life.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.920]   And even if you have
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.620]   a setback,
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.980]   you have a bad,
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   bad investment,
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.420]   you suffer
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.280]   some kind of
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.200]   significant setback
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.360]   and you have to rebuild
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:12.880]   from nothing,
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.360]   you can rebuild it
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.560]   much faster,
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.620]   better from scratch
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.600]   because you became
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.720]   the different kind of person.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.220]   Back to school,
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.060]   which is where I started.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.260]   It's not the grades
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.120]   that ultimately count,
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:26.840]   it's the learning.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.200]   Learn the work well
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:29.720]   and the grades
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.660]   come automatically.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.420]   It's not the grades
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.900]   that count,
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.940]   it's the learning.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.500]   If you just learn
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.400]   the work well,
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.900]   the grades come automatically.
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.520]   On the other hand,
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.900]   if you focus on the grades,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.180]   the inverse is not
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.060]   necessarily true.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.060]   Having spent a lot of time
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.580]   thinking about
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.040]   the grades,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.660]   education,
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.520]   and knowing that
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.300]   that's a common thing
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.080]   for all of us,
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.160]   this is something
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.420]   that I just see so clearly.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.020]   And what's amazing about it
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.900]   is I never thought about it
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.700]   when I was in school.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.040]   But I point this out to you.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.020]   As a homeschooler,
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.000]   I don't keep letter grades.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.860]   I don't keep performance grades.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.240]   I have embraced testing
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.340]   as a learning methodology.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.040]   I used to say
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   I didn't embrace testing
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.920]   and I have changed that.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.000]   I have come to believe
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.820]   that testing
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.520]   is in of itself
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.020]   a way to improve your life.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.180]   It's a learning tool
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.520]   because it seems
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.080]   from all the memory researchers
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.700]   and scientists,
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.400]   it seems that
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.780]   testing yourself
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.600]   allows your brain
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.060]   to actually record things
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.100]   more effectively.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.940]   Some super interesting studies
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.020]   that have been publicized
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.420]   and talked about
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.280]   where it's actually
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.020]   like they did a study one time
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.980]   where they had
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.120]   a certain set of people
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.900]   reread content multiple times
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.340]   and they had another set of people
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.680]   read the content one time
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.860]   and then test multiple times,
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.800]   whether through the use
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.400]   of free active recall
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.140]   or some other testing methodology.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.300]   And just by being tested
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.120]   multiple times,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.680]   the people who were just tested
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.260]   and only read the material one time
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.220]   had a higher rate of retention
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:02.860]   and learning
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:03.440]   than the people
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.520]   who just read the material
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.280]   multiple times.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.380]   So I have embraced,
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.800]   I have come to embrace testing.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.420]   What I have not come to embrace
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.480]   is the concept
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.820]   of intense grading,
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.500]   especially not for young children.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.740]   It's a waste of time.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.720]   The grade is primarily
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.480]   just a marker.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.100]   And what's interesting about it,
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.380]   and again,
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:20.980]   this is not,
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.780]   this is not,
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.940]   this is not a revelation
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.020]   to anybody except me,
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.340]   because I,
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.180]   but the idea is that
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.940]   if you do poorly in something,
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.300]   all that's a sign for
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.360]   is that you need to repeat it.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.520]   That's it.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.440]   If you do poorly in something,
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:36.960]   it's just a sign
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.540]   you don't know well,
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.060]   don't know,
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.600]   don't know it well enough.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.560]   And so just do the class again.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.800]   Get another book,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.580]   read the book again,
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.780]   go through the class again,
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.660]   try a different teacher.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.800]   Just keep going
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.080]   until you learn something.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.780]   And when you think back
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.020]   and you reflect on
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.760]   so many things,
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.320]   students who do poorly in school,
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.520]   and you think,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.300]   wouldn't it be better
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.520]   if we just slowed everything down?
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.860]   And wouldn't it be better
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.520]   if instead of advancing you mindlessly
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.780]   through a set of classes
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.200]   based upon your age,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.720]   we advanced you
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.760]   through a set of classes
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.240]   based upon your mastery
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.240]   of the material.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.400]   And you simply repeated the material
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.420]   using new inputs,
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.120]   fresh books,
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:17.920]   fresh concepts,
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.800]   fresh presentation
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.220]   to try to take advantage
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.740]   of unfired skills
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.840]   and synapses in your brain.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.360]   And you just repeat things
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.380]   until you're an A student
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.220]   in every class.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.520]   Well, now all of a sudden,
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.480]   wouldn't that be transformative?
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.140]   Because instead of just struggling through
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.280]   and doing just enough
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.520]   to get a C and pass the class
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.120]   and move on,
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.780]   you just went through the class
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.340]   again, twice, three times,
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.060]   whatever it takes
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.660]   until you're an A,
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.120]   then it'll stick with you for life.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.760]   And when you think about education
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.600]   being such a powerful short set of years,
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.240]   and yet how important
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.520]   that educational foundation is,
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.500]   it's amazing.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.820]   So it's not the grades
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.720]   that ultimately count.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.640]   It's the learning.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.420]   Learn to work well
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.640]   and the grades come automatically.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.480]   Focus on the grades.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.360]   The opposite is not true necessarily.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.480]   Become a man of value in the world
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.640]   and the salary and riches
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.900]   will come automatically.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.820]   Focus on the salary and riches
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.660]   and the inverse is not true.
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:21.700]   You have to become a man
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.220]   of value.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:28.300]   If I were rewriting Tim's book,
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.440]   I would today
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.460]   talk about the fact
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.940]   that you absolutely
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.600]   can enjoy a Lamborghini lifestyle now,
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.480]   but that all of your consumption goals
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.420]   should be specific rewards
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.360]   that are connected to
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.280]   performance,
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.140]   enduring, lasting performance.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.480]   So for example,
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.460]   if you make for yourself
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.180]   the commitment
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.640]   that I'm always going to live
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.840]   on 50% of my income
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.240]   and you just automatically
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.900]   off the top save 50% of your income,
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:04.220]   then you can spend significantly
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.320]   with the other side.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:05.740]   And by the way,
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.180]   Tim did talk about that in the book.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.540]   Again, I'm not mad at Tim.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.460]   Just pointing out
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.620]   that I wasn't smart enough
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.440]   to grasp it
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.720]   of the importance
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.840]   of it being a very small amount.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.180]   Use consumption-related goals
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.720]   to encourage you
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.340]   and cause you to move forward,
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.660]   but make sure that those
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.580]   consumption goals
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.340]   are not of primary importance.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.140]   Make sure that those consumption goals
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.880]   are of very, very modest importance.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.680]   Think back to the way
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.420]   that I teach this
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.640]   when I just talk about
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.940]   how much should you spend on a car.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.440]   A lot of people are shocked
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.660]   when I say 10%.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.160]   But if you follow the 10% rule,
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.280]   it doesn't mean you have to
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.780]   always drive an old car,
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.280]   meaning you should buy a car
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:44.900]   if you're really interested
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:45.460]   in wealth building,
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.040]   you should buy a car
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:46.620]   that's not worth
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.480]   or own vehicles and other stuff
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.780]   that's not worth more than 10%
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.520]   of your annual income.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.640]   And a guy making $100,000
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:51.900]   says,
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.000]   I'm not driving a $10,000 car.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.060]   Okay.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.760]   You want to drive a $50,000 car?
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.040]   Want to drive a $100,000 car?
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.120]   Change the income.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.560]   And if you change that metric
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.100]   and you use the car as a driver,
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.140]   a motivating force,
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.500]   then you get the car
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.020]   and you get so much more.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.840]   But if you just go out
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.200]   with a $100,000 income
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.600]   and you buy a $100,000 car
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.900]   just because you can,
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.320]   you're probably going to come
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.320]   to regret it in life.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.680]   I'm going to wind this down there.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.620]   Don't say,
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.800]   seek for the easy hack.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.860]   Take the hard way.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.820]   Take the difficult way.
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.120]   Become a different person.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.400]   That is the better path.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.220]   And it doesn't take
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.280]   as long as you think.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.000]   If you're the kind of person
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.280]   who's motivated to
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.080]   live the lifestyle
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:39.800]   of the new rich,
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.760]   if you're the kind of person
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.560]   who is motivated
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.520]   to learn a language,
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.040]   it doesn't require
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.100]   that much more
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.160]   for you to do it
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.560]   the genuine way,
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.060]   the hard way.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.600]   But you get a lot.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.720]   You get a lot more benefit for it.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.100]   Don't look for the hacks.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.300]   Look for the real deal.
