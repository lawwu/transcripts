[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.700]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.320]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.300]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host, and in today's podcast, I would like to share
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.320]   with you a concept that has been extremely helpful to me throughout my life called the
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.100]   1,000% formula.
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.420]   This is something that I first learned in high school from Brian Tracy, who was one
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.480]   of my mentors that I listened to for many, many years, and I found this to be such a
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.800]   practical and useful outline that I've just never been able to get away from it.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280]   I've mentioned this repeatedly in podcasts, and sometimes I'll get a question from a listener
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.560]   saying, hey, what was that podcast that Joshua talked about, the 1,000% formula?
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.140]   And in the past, I didn't have a standalone podcast for that, it's buried in, I talk about
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.740]   it in many of my courses, I talk about it in various podcasts, but I wanted to create
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.320]   a standalone podcast for you to teach you the 1,000% formula.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.480]   Now again, I learned this from Brian Tracy, his version was somewhat close to my version,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.360]   but I've taken it, I've modified it, and adapted it to my own needs over the years, and I want
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.280]   to share it with you now.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.680]   The basic idea of the 1,000% formula is that small daily increases in productivity, repeated
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.820]   consistently, can lead to dramatic and negative consequences.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.980]   The way that Brian would ask the question would be to say, could you, if you really
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:44.160]   wanted to, could you increase your productivity, your performance, your output, and your effectiveness
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.300]   and your work and business today by a mere one-tenth of 1%?
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.100]   Could you get one-tenth of 1% better?
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.240]   Well, I confess that I certainly could today get one-tenth of 1%.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.260]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.340]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.400]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.420]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.440]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.480]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.540]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.600]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.640]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.660]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.720]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.780]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.820]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.840]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.900]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.120]   I would say that's a good idea.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.600]   And I believe that you also could get one-tenth of 1% better, more productive, higher performance,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.780]   more effective, et cetera, in your work and in your business today if you wanted to.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.620]   And I think that that can be repeated over time.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.340]   Well, if you do the math, one-tenth of 1% improvement per day leads to one-half of 1%
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.620]   improvement per week.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.640]   Over time, that makes about a 2% improvement per month and winds up being about a 1% improvement
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.520]   over the year if we use four-week months.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.980]   And that's about a 1,000% improvement in the course of a decade, knowing how these things
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.480]   compound.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.160]   Don't get too bogged down in the specific numbers.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.420]   The idea is that one-tenth of 1% per day, repeated over a five-day work week consistently
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.800]   over the years, allows you to be about 1,000% more productive, more effective in your work
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.240]   life.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.160]   Now, if you wind up...
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.200]   If you wind up being more effective, more productive, then in a capitalist system, in
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.000]   the fullness of time, your own personal effectiveness will be recognized by higher income.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.840]   And so I think that if you're 1,000% better at your job and at your income, then there's
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.500]   a good chance that you'll be able to command a 10-times higher wage, 1,000% higher wage.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.140]   It's not...
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.560]   It's not automatic.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.480]   It's not linear.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.400]   You have to do some significant career advancement moves in order to fully realize the value
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.100]   of this plan.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.900]   But the foundation is in what you do.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.060]   If you want to make more money, you have to begin by becoming more valuable.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.720]   And so how do you do that?
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.220]   Well, step one is reading.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.960]   Every day, you get up at least two hours before you have to be somewhere every day.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.120]   And you're going to be reading.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   And you invest the first hour into yourself by reading something that is uplifting, educational,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.080]   motivational, spiritual, something that's going to help you and improve you and give
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.580]   you ideas and concepts, inspiration in your life.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.220]   As Tracy puts it, reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.680]   Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680]   And so...
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.560]   And so what's cool is that if you spend about one hour a day reading a book...
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.000]   By the way, this should include and can include reading a book with your ears.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.700]   It doesn't only have to be with your eyes.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.480]   But if you spend about an hour a day reading a book, then you'll read on average about
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.100]   a book a week.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.100]   If you read on average about a book a week, you'll read on average about 50 books per
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.400]   year.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.580]   If you go and you look at the world of academia, a formal advanced degree, a doctoral degree,
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.660]   a master's degree, etc.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.660]   will often require you to read and absorb and synthesize something around 30 to 50 books
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.040]   and then write a dissertation on those books.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.240]   And so if you do this per year, you're getting the equivalent of about a master's degree
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   or a doctoral degree of information, training, etc.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.980]   in your field every single year.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.980]   Now, I think that you should have a deeper strategy.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.920]   Which I won't go into here.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.420]   But the basic idea behind what you choose to read is that you should read in your field
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.500]   and read towards your goals.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.620]   So read anything that you want.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.980]   But I think there should be a good variety in your reading materials.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.680]   You want to choose books that are going to move you in the direction that you want to
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.360]   go in life.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.300]   This does not have to all be how to become a better manager.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.080]   But if you are a manager, it should include some books on how to become a better manager.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.960]   But it should also include books.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.880]   Books on other areas of goals that you have or directions that you want to take yourself.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.180]   Do not keep all of your reading light and fluffy.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.140]   Instead, focus on learning the real meat of your industry.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.180]   Study the textbooks.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.500]   Study the formal textbooks, the deep level content, the fundamental texts that are available
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.280]   in your field.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.940]   I say this because in our modern day, we have access now to so much great information through
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.440]   podcasts, videos, etc.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   But this kind of information in any field is often the most surface level information.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.820]   And there are many of us who consume that information.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.120]   And that's a great start.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.640]   Better than not consuming it.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.320]   But if you don't go deeper, you're never going to wind up being a thought leader.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   So when you consume information and education and learning in an area, you should go a little
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.680]   deeper and say, how can I get back to the core fundamental sources of this area?
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.920]   So make sure that some of your reading is in the core fundamental sources of this area.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.780]   Make sure that your reading is at a deep level.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.200]   Make sure that you are looking up, again, the college textbooks that are in use in the
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.040]   classes that are related to something that you want to improve at.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.400]   Make sure that you're going back to the source materials.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.160]   Make sure you're reading the old books and the new books.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.480]   Incidentally, this is one of the things that is most important about making sure that you
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.600]   have habits of reading with your eyes as well as with your ears.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.500]   For modern popular level texts, you can often find an audiobook.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.640]   And so I find this a very convenient format.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:33.560]   I like to consume books in while I'm out walking, jogging, hiking, etc., doing exercise, doing dishes.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.180]   I like to consume modern popular level texts in the form of an audiobook.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:45.800]   But when you go to your serious reading and you're reading a textbook, a college level textbook in
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.720]   your field, or you're going back to the primary sources and you're studying the doctoral
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.320]   dissertation that somebody wrote, or you're reading a book that was written in 1950 that continues to
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.880]   be a book that you're reading, you're reading a book that was written in 1950 that continues to be
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.940]   the basic book that explains everything you need to know about a subject, it's unusual to find those
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.100]   books in an audiobook format.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.700]   So you need to make sure that you have time to read with your ears, but also that you have a basic
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.020]   habit of reading with your eyes on a daily basis.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.000]   Now, step number two of Tracy's thousand percent formula is to make a list.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.980]   You make a list of everything you have to do that day.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.260]   It's important to have a physical list of the things that you need to do.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.780]   And then you take that list.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.700]   Then you organize it and you prioritize it.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.480]   You organize your list by priorities.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.520]   You determine which task is of number one importance, number two importance, et cetera.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.320]   As Tracy says, if you will simply plan and prioritize your activities every day in advance,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.400]   you'll increase your productivity by 25% on your very first day.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.020]   This is a habit that's easy to know about.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.360]   It's harder to do consistently.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.800]   And yet it remains the fundamental action that you and I can,
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.540]   take on a daily basis to improve our effectiveness,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:07.380]   prioritize the things that we need to do and always do the most important things first.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:15.900]   Step four, start on your most important task and work on it single-mindedly with concentration,
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.080]   focus and discipline until your most important task is done.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.480]   As Tracy says, if you will concentrate on your most important task,
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.820]   you will increase your productivity.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.660]   You will increase your productivity by 50%.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:38.040]   So the point of combining these things together is that the reading provides you with creative fodder and information,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.500]   but reading is never enough to advance and to be useful.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.320]   Productivity is the key.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.380]   And so notice that listing out what you need to do, prioritizing it,
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.720]   starting on your most important task and working on it single-mindedly with concentration,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.400]   focus and discipline and until it's done,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.800]   that's where you're going to be able to do the most important task.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.860]   You get action.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.200]   Action.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.040]   Step number five, listen to educational audio in your car.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:12.220]   For most people, historically, I haven't seen this data updated in a very long time,
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.520]   but back in the 90s and the 2000s,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.220]   it was said that the average person spends about the same amount of time in his or her car
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.860]   as the average college student spends in class.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.780]   Let's say that's how you get there is let's say that a full-time college load
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.660]   is considered to be 12 to 18 credit hours per week.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:40.620]   So 12 hours per week divided over seven days would be 1.7 hours per day of time in the car.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.120]   That's probably not too far off of what many people commute.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.180]   Frequently, people commute 35 minutes back and forth to work
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.560]   and then all the other little time, little trips here and there.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.800]   And so if you turn your drive time into learning time,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.760]   you can spend about the same amount of time learning
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.260]   as a college student does while you're also doing other things.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.840]   And of course, many of us have other activities as well,
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.720]   doing dishes, cleaning up, doing yard work, et cetera.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.680]   And so you want to listen to educational audio.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.000]   Now, my answer here is, or my suggestion,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.680]   is that you choose your learning materials, again,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.180]   based upon your goals and what is valuable to you in the moment.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.200]   And so your content should include podcasts.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.560]   Podcasts have a lot of benefits.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.020]   Some significant disadvantages.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:35.120]   A great benefit of a podcast is the access to current cutting-edge ideas and conversations.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.960]   The problem of podcasts is they're not all very content-rich.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.900]   There's a lot of time that can be lost due to the minimal preparation
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.460]   that is put into the production of many podcasts.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.980]   And so you want your listening time to be efficient.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.700]   And so you want to consume the things that are going to be the most,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.080]   most efficient.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:03.580]   Podcasts are most useful to you to dip your toe in something new.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.920]   And that's how I tend to consume podcasts,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.440]   is simply to take an area of interest of mine and go and look for a podcast on it.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   Because there's no financial cost, I don't have to make a big commitment to it.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.420]   I don't have to go and buy a bunch of books.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.420]   I just, eh, here's a podcast on it.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.560]   And then because of the way podcasts are often done,
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.760]   in an hour of podcast listening, you can get an overview of a subject
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.700]   that may be hard to understand.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.820]   It's hard to get in an eight-hour audio book
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.340]   that is trying to provide information in a more comprehensive manner.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.560]   So choose podcasts to listen to that fit your goals
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.980]   and that are based around things that are valuable to you in the moment.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.520]   There are classic audio programs that are available.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.960]   I've been a big consumer over the years of Nightingale Conant programs.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.820]   They were a provider of audio programs, self-help programs.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.680]   They're still really good.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.040]   A lot of the good old stuff.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.560]   And this is where Tony Robbins got his start and Brian Tracy programs, etc.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.260]   And there's lots of other programs that are available from places like that.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.300]   I think audio books are in many ways a superior option to either of these options.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.660]   Because an audio book gives you superior quality and insights into a subject
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.440]   because of the nature of its creation and editing.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.000]   When an author sits down and writes a book,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.920]   unless it's just a quick, you know, $1.99 Kindle book,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.320]   he generally will invest thousands of hours,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.000]   definitely hundreds and generally thousands of hours
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.260]   into the actual creation of that book.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.700]   Systemized research process, preparing for it,
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.940]   a very careful organization principle behind the book.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.920]   He will engage in very careful editing to make sure that all of the fluff is gone
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.580]   and the real meat is there.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.320]   This is why books are such a superior option
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.900]   for your book.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:01.120]   For your learning, because they are giants standing on the shoulders of giants,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.440]   standing on the shoulders of giants,
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:09.800]   giving you their insights and education for a mere $10 or $15 or $20, etc.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.600]   And so here, your best options are an audible subscription,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.220]   as well as something through your local library, such as Hoopla,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.320]   where you gain access to free books.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.500]   So if you have a local library card,
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.460]   a lot of times,
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.500]   most local libraries now have some kind of audiobook service.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.240]   Hoopla, there are others as well,
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.320]   but Hoopla seems to be the leading one at the moment,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.460]   where now you can listen to audiobooks for free
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.640]   based on your library subscription.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.580]   It's a really great option.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.180]   Next, I really love YouTube University.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.260]   And by that, I just mean going to YouTube and looking for videos on things.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.620]   I think that a YouTube premium subscription
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.660]   that allows you to skip all advertisements
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.520]   and to download videos
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.180]   so that they're always available to you.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:55.680]   And I think that a YouTube premium subscription
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.180]   that allows you to skip all advertisements
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:56.180]   and to download videos on things
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:56.520]   that are always available
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.960]   is some of the best money that you can make.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.080]   YouTube is fantastic because of its cutting-edge nature.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.860]   You can often get some of the most current insights into a field,
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.420]   get involved with some of the current debates,
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.880]   current best practices, etc.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.400]   Downside of YouTube is it can be time-consuming
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.160]   and hard to filter for quality.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.580]   There's not a really great quality filter.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.600]   And this is, again, why I think that something that has been vetted
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.820]   by a lot of people,
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.980]   by trusted editors,
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.280]   is of higher priority.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.900]   But because that vetting process is so time-consuming,
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.940]   you often don't get cutting-edge information.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.560]   So they should go together.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.220]   And then, in addition to YouTube University,
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.460]   of course, iTunes University, quite literally,
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.760]   leads into free online college courses.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.880]   So iTunes University or Coursera,
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.880]   all of the online courses available from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.800]   It's all available.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.300]   You simply go to the website and you can consume the college courses.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.240]   And I think this is really important to do for areas that you have interest in
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.820]   because you want to make sure that your learning is not ignorant,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.640]   that you are not ignorant of what is considered to be
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.860]   the general standard of knowledge in a subject.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:22.020]   You want to make sure that you're not ignorant of the corpus of information
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.780]   that a skilled and trained person in that area would be.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.260]   And so going and consuming college lectures
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.160]   and consuming all of the college lectures for courses
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.660]   will help you to make sure that your learning
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.920]   is not unduly influenced by the one book you found that you really liked
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.380]   or the author that you latched onto,
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.920]   but rather that you understand what is taught at the college level.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.500]   And college teachers are,
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.760]   by virtue of their screening process,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.420]   they are experts in their domain.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.700]   And they have a duty to their students
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.760]   to represent all of the different aspects
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.740]   of their particular course content.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.940]   And so it's a really great way of making sure
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.320]   that your knowledge is compendious
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.120]   and that you yourself have a broad education
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.400]   that complements your deep education
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.540]   in the self-chosen materials.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.120]   So those are all things that are available to you
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.060]   to listen to in your car.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.600]   I would encourage you also to make certain
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.620]   that not all of your learnings
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.920]   are self-directed.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.620]   And that's why I would encourage you
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.900]   to consider engaging in formalized courses
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.100]   and credentialization in your field.
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.080]   While self-directed learning
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.240]   is the most powerful form of learning
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.980]   because of your engagement with it,
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.420]   self-directed learning is not always recognized
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.720]   immediately in the business world.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.540]   And so formalized learning that comes with credentials
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:51.760]   is a really important component of your overall package.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.380]   It may be,
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.380]   you know,
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.720]   hip to despise a college degree
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.980]   or despise an MBA,
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.960]   but those formalized credentials
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.240]   and the achievement of those formalized credentials
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.320]   is still one of the most reliable way
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.960]   for individuals to raise salaries.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.160]   Pay attention and go ahead
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.080]   and get your formalized credentials as well.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.280]   Now Tracy's number six in his thousand percent formula
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.040]   is to ask yourself two questions after every activity.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.340]   And these are two questions
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.000]   that I consider to be incredibly useful
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.340]   for self-coaching.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.900]   Question number one is,
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.820]   what did I do right?
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.000]   You can do this every day.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.200]   What did I do right today?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.280]   You can do this after every meeting.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.840]   What did I do right in that meeting?
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.600]   You can do this after every date.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.000]   What did I do right on that date?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.760]   Do this after every trip.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.140]   What did I do right on that trip?
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.500]   What did I do right?
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.760]   It's important to take a moment
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.640]   and acknowledge the things that you do well,
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.100]   the things that went well
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.580]   and celebrate your successes.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.720]   Question number two that you ask yourself
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.840]   after every activity is,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.600]   what would I do differently next time?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.040]   What would I do differently next time?
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.120]   Notice the wonderful tone,
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.320]   not judgmental, but informed.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.540]   What would I do differently next time
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.300]   if I had the chance?
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.560]   And if you just ask yourself those two questions
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.320]   after every activity that you're involved in,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.680]   what did I do right?
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.200]   And what would I do differently next time?
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.420]   You can coach yourself
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.940]   in the direction of your goals and dreams.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.940]   Now Tracy's point seven of his thousand percent formula
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.700]   is treat everyone you meet and interact with
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.160]   like a million dollar customer.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.440]   Treat everybody with respect,
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.160]   with kindness, with esteem.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.200]   Treat everyone you meet and interact with
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.300]   like a million dollar customer.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.700]   And if you do that,
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.000]   you go around through the world
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.040]   surrounded by a pleasant haze of happiness
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.680]   and respect and appreciation
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.640]   because it comes from you.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.180]   Now over the years,
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.420]   I've taken those seven points,
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:53.740]   which are three,
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.420]   which are Tracy's original seven points.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.920]   And I've just added just a few things to them.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.780]   So again, Tracy's are read two hours a day,
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.460]   sorry, one hour a day,
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.520]   or first thing in the morning,
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.040]   list what you need to do that day,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.120]   prioritize your list,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.600]   start on your most important task,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.740]   work on it single-mindedly,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.220]   listen to educational audio programs in your car,
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.520]   ask yourself two questions after every activity,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.020]   and then treat everyone you meet
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.580]   and interact with like a million dollar customer.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.440]   That was Tracy's.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.460]   As I've modified it over the year,
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.920]   I have a tendency to divide it into education and action.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.160]   And so for education,
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.440]   I've always added a couple of things.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.860]   Number one, you have reading and listening,
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.200]   but I've always recommended to people
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.540]   that they also attend conferences.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.180]   I think that having a goal
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.060]   of attending four conferences per year in your field
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.200]   is a really useful goal.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.320]   And I've benefited from this so much.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.820]   I have not done this myself over the last few years
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.380]   because of having a bunch of babies in the house,
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.320]   hard for my wife for me to be away.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.340]   And so I actively avoid being away
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.280]   very much.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.140]   Of course, today we can do online conferences,
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.120]   which are a great option.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.920]   But the point of a conference
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.700]   is that you can have in one single conference
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.520]   a very concentrated exposure
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.880]   to all of the activity in your field.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.520]   You can not only meet the movers and shakers,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.000]   not only harvest the current cutting edge ideas,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.540]   but get a broad overview of the topics that are of interest.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.140]   I love to take a brochure from a conference,
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.080]   and read through the titles for the talks
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.820]   and the presentations.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.880]   And that'll give me an idea
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.380]   of what are the current areas of focus
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.760]   for this particular industry
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.940]   or this particular movement.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.300]   You also, of course, have access to an expo hall.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.120]   You can go and you can find out
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.240]   who all the companies are
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.960]   and the vendors that are involved in your industry.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.260]   And these things are the threads that you can pull on
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.980]   to start to push yourself
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.420]   in the direction of new opportunities.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.140]   Conferences are,
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.760]   wonderful ways for you to make connections with people,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.500]   to start to build friendships.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.940]   They are the best way for you to dig your well
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.460]   of friendships before you're thirsty.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.080]   You always want to dig your well before you're thirsty.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.560]   And you want to dig your well of contacts
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.340]   and connections and friendships in your industry
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.240]   or in an industry that you aspire to join
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.840]   long before you need them.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.640]   It's difficult to go to a conference
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.740]   with a folder full of resumes
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.220]   and go booth to booth and pass them out.
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.820]   That's difficult.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.740]   Not impossible, not a bad idea, but difficult.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.600]   It's much more effective
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.360]   for you to go to an annual industry conference
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.040]   for two or three years in a row,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.180]   making connections, making friends intentionally
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.420]   while at that conference.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.400]   And then three years from now,
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.460]   let it be known that you're looking for more opportunities.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.280]   But in order to have the best opportunities,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.460]   you have to have been digging that well of connection
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.540]   and contact, et cetera.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.140]   I have a whole class that I teach some people
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.860]   on how to maximize conferences.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.760]   They're very underused by many people in today's world.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.920]   And yet, as we increasingly are isolated physically,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.820]   their importance of industry conferences is only rising.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.360]   And so making good use of them is really important.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.120]   I want to give you just a hint though.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.760]   One of the best things that you can do at a conference
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.560]   is use it as a way to gain access
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.180]   to all of the people you're talking to.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.480]   All the people who were involved in that industry.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.660]   And so your best friend in making good use of conferences
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:34.160]   is for you to take the brochure
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.660]   and systematically write down the speakers of the conference,
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.120]   their names, connect with them in some format,
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.860]   write down the companies that those speakers work for,
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.180]   get familiar with their work,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.040]   and then go through the vendor list
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.900]   and be connected with all the people
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.900]   who are supplying that industry.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.880]   And if you do that,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.380]   and you start systematically making connections at a conference,
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.920]   all you need is one conference
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.360]   to give you your connection roadmap,
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.780]   which can be a tremendous roadmap for your opportunities.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.620]   Now, another thing that I urge people to do
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.200]   is to learn how to be an effective public speaker.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.040]   I really love still to recommend Toastmasters International
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.160]   as the single best, most available organization
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.560]   for you to practice and polish
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:21.880]   both your skills and your skills.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.200]   Both your public speaking skills
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.500]   and your leadership skills
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.320]   in a structured, safe, risk-free environment.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.360]   And if you do that,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.040]   then conferences will ultimately become
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.660]   one of the most important ways
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.720]   for you to gain exposure for yourself and your ideas.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.420]   After all, think of what we've said.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.960]   You've read, if you've read 500 books in your field
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.860]   over the next decade,
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.900]   and you develop polished public speaking skills,
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.120]   how is it possible that anyone at that conference
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.400]   is going to know more than you?
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.480]   And why wouldn't you be one of the most
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.320]   sought-after speakers in that field?
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.940]   If you're doing the hard work of genuinely preparing yourself
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.080]   and you're implementing on a daily basis
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   these ideas into your actual work,
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.500]   thus building a resume of success on a daily basis,
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.220]   why wouldn't you yourself be one of the sought-after speakers
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.960]   on the industry conference circuit?
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.240]   That's the 25-minute version
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.060]   of the Toastmasters International.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.700]   The 1,000% formula.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.260]   Brian Tracy taught that to me in high school.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.800]   I have implemented it pretty decently over the years,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.720]   and the formula has worked pretty decently.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.500]   And I think that this can be repeated
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.160]   multiple times during somebody's career.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.340]   I think that it's very reasonable
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.320]   for somebody to start off as a young adult,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.140]   early 20s, mid-20s,
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.100]   make a 10x increase in income
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.040]   over the first decade of his or her career,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.440]   I think it's very reasonable
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.040]   to make another 10x jump over the second decade.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.780]   At that point in time,
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.260]   your selection of an industry
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.360]   seems to make a much bigger difference
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.440]   than some other factors,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.080]   and your willingness to do the hard work.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.160]   So let's put some numbers on this to get an idea.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.820]   Let's say you come out of,
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.000]   let's say that you're 25 years old
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.300]   and you're making $60,000.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.880]   Well, going from 60 to $600,000,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.240]   is very doable in a decade in many industries.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.040]   Again, there's a lot of strategic shuffling
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.720]   that has to happen.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.260]   You need to be good at promoting yourself and your ideas.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.640]   You need to be good at moving for opportunities.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.220]   You need to be good at choosing companies
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.760]   that are on the upswing,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.020]   choosing industries that are on the upswing, et cetera.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.800]   It's not automatic,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.780]   but I think that's a very reliable path.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.880]   I've seen it done again and again.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.280]   Making another jump from $600,000 a year
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.860]   to $6 million a year is very doable.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.100]   Very doable.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.320]   Very doable.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.300]   But in order for it to be done,
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.280]   you need to be in an industry
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.020]   where you are directly rewarded
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.600]   for your great effectiveness.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.800]   And so you're either gonna be
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.000]   in upper levels of management at a company
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.020]   where you have good bonus compensation, et cetera,
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.880]   or you are gonna be in a place
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.200]   where you have a direct connection
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.340]   between your impact and your effectiveness.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.640]   And that's only possible
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.100]   in certain highly compensated areas.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.820]   So if you are involved,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.360]   you're involved in sales,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.600]   you're involved in marketing,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.260]   and you have a piece of the action, so to speak,
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.440]   then you can definitely justify
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.260]   excellent multi-seven-figure salaries.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.060]   To go by another 1,000% jump
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.180]   from $6 million to $60 million
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.740]   is certainly possible,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.620]   but it becomes very difficult
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.540]   to predict the exact pathway.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.440]   So eventually this formula does,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.800]   I think,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.980]   break down in terms of its predictability.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.120]   I can't promise this four times over.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.900]   But there are definitely many people
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.980]   who over the course of three decades
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.100]   have been able to repeat the formula
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.560]   three times over.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.360]   There are a shockingly high number
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.200]   of businessmen earning $60 million a year
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.500]   after a three-decade career.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.600]   A shockingly high number.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.580]   There's a shockingly high number of people
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.680]   making $600 million a year
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.720]   on the end of a four-decade career.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.180]   But again, this has to do
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.520]   with your willingness to do the work,
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.000]   your willingness to take the risk, etc.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.160]   So I don't present this to you
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.000]   as a perfect description
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.440]   of what you can expect,
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.000]   but I think it's a useful
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.100]   and compelling mental model,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.660]   which when combined with other ways
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.040]   of making sure that you're moving
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.120]   in the direction of a business,
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.840]   you're working at a highly valuable skills,
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.600]   you're working at the highest levels of value, etc.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.980]   I think it's a very useful model.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.460]   And at the end of the day,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.600]   it helps you and me to focus on what we can control.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.120]   We can control what time we go to bed today
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.100]   so that we can get up tomorrow
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.020]   and read for 30 to 60 minutes in our field.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.620]   We can control the list that we make today
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.040]   of everything that we need to do tomorrow.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.900]   We can take a moment and we can prioritize that list
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.020]   based upon those things
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.900]   that are of the highest priority
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.220]   and those that are lowest priority.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.300]   Tomorrow, we can start on our most important task
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.020]   and we can work on it single-mindedly
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.720]   with concentration, focus, and discipline
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.520]   until it's done.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.520]   Today and tomorrow, when we have time,
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.000]   we can line up some useful and helpful educational audio
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.040]   to put in our ears and in our car
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.480]   when we're driving, walking, etc.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.840]   Today and tomorrow,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.880]   you can ask yourself those two questions.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.460]   After every activity.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.140]   And today and tomorrow,
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   you can start treating everyone you meet
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.560]   and interact with like a million-dollar customer.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.440]   I hope these ideas in one specific place are useful to you
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.700]   and I hope that you experience great success
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.260]   from the application of them.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.740]   As I close down today's podcast,
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.740]   I want to remind you of the event that I am hosting
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.160]   in January of 2024 in Panama City, Panama.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.140]   And I would love to extend to you a personal invitation
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.680]   for you to come to that event.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.260]   I've teamed up with my friends,
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.820]   Gabriel Custodiate and Mikkel Thorup
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.060]   to do a one-week,
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.120]   we're calling it an investment tour,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.360]   an expat exploration and investment tour of Panama.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.540]   And this will be a one-week tour.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.840]   We're going to have events in Panama City.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.340]   We've got conference presentations
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.960]   on various aspects of investing,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.120]   internationalization, banking, taxation,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.520]   cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, etc.,
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.480]   wealth protection, family foundations,
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.520]   offshore planning.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.160]   We have several tours planned
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.400]   of a couple different communities.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:49.660]   We have a couple of different events
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.080]   as well as like a gold storage vault
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.200]   that we're going to be visiting, etc.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.660]   It's going to be an amazing time.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.420]   And not only will it be full of information,
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.040]   inspiration, education,
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.980]   but it's going to be full of fun.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.840]   I'll be there hanging out with you the whole time
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.520]   as well as 39 of your fellow listeners.
