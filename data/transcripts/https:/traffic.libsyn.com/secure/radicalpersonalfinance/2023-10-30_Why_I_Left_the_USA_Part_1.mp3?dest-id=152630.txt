[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560]   insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.920]   and meaningful life now while building a plan
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.180]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.680]   I'm your host, and on today's podcast,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.160]   I'm going to introduce a series here
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.220]   called Why I Left the United States.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.280]   But don't worry, I'm not just simply sharing my story
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.180]   or just telling tales.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.820]   I'm going to be teaching you a series of lessons
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.980]   that I think are useful and appropriate as to think about,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.740]   and these lessons are going to be intensely financial.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.600]   My two of my three reasons as to why I left the United States
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.860]   almost five years ago and why I've stayed gone
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.600]   for most of that time are specifically financial,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.100]   and so I believe this is appropriate content
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.320]   for a personal finance podcast.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.440]   You might think that I've talked a lot
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.640]   about internationalization,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.040]   but long-term listeners of the podcast will know
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.960]   that I've never really shared a lot
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.440]   about my own personal experiences and feelings here
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.820]   in this podcast.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.240]   In this public format, in a couple of my courses,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.800]   I've shared more, but here in this format
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.760]   on the public podcast, I've not shared a lot
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.160]   of my own personal experience.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.780]   I've done that for the privacy of my family,
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.380]   and more than anything, just simply because
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.220]   I want to test things.
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.580]   I think one of my own virtues and also challenges
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.420]   is that I don't want to say things
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.940]   that I'm not confident are worth saying,
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.640]   that I'm not confident are true.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   And so that's kept me from,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.560]   I'm probably speaking about things
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.280]   that I should have spoken about earlier
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.900]   because it takes me time to become convinced of something.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.200]   When I left the United States five years ago,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.360]   I of course shared here in the podcast
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.760]   that I was doing so, but I didn't say to anyone else
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.440]   that you should leave and here's why,
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.760]   because I wasn't confident in that opinion.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.840]   And I still would never say to someone flat out,
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.760]   you should leave a country.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.040]   It's a very nuanced discussion
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.480]   that has so many different levels and layers.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.380]   But I do sometimes fear
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.140]   that I've not been a good leader
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.380]   by waiting so long to be sure of something.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.120]   Kind of the same way,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.140]   if you remember my Bitcoin apology podcast
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.440]   where I talked about how Bitcoin probably could have
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.400]   and should have been a central part
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.540]   of my personal finance content from the beginning.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.900]   But I don't like to be one of those guys
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.000]   that just gets into something
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.220]   and starts blurting out things
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.000]   and then turns around five years later and says,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.400]   oops, I was wrong, sorry guys.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.180]   And that slowness is both a benefit,
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.660]   but it's also a disadvantage.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.060]   And in many ways,
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.100]   some of the internationalization stuff
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.600]   that maybe some of the lessons that you'll learn today
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.640]   are more relevant than they ever were.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.440]   When I left the United States five years ago,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.660]   the world was peaceful.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.120]   The country was doing really well.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.900]   All the trends were pointed in the right direction.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.880]   I didn't leave in protest of a political administration
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.900]   or anything like that.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.760]   I just said, hey,
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.380]   things are really good.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.480]   Things are really good in the United States right now,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.640]   but there's a possibility that in the future they may not be.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.600]   And so I want to be prepared for that.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.640]   And as I talked about in a recent podcast episode,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.460]   I believe the time you prepare for bad times
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.640]   is easiest when there's simply no clouds of bad times.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.360]   Whereas today, I think many more people are interested.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.240]   And that interest is fine.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.260]   It's not too late.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.340]   And I'm not advocating just leaving your country.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.560]   I'm going to talk about this in a thoughtful and nuanced way
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.420]   and bring in some current events
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.460]   as indications of what I saw
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.360]   five years ago.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.260]   Five years ago is concerns for me.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.200]   But it's not too late.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.820]   There's plenty of preparation that could be done.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.660]   And I'm going to be doing this series
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.620]   and also promoting heavily my upcoming event.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.280]   Remember that in January of 2024,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.320]   I am co-hosting an event in Panama City, Panama.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.140]   It's a one-week event
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.740]   talking about internationalization broadly in Panama,
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.900]   specifically that I'm hosting with my friends,
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.800]   Mikkel Thorup and Gabriel Custodiat.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.760]   And I want to urge you to sign up for that.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.460]   We're down to the final days for registrations.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.500]   This is the time.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.580]   Go to, if you want to sign up now,
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.360]   I'll get into more details.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.340]   Just go to
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.680]   expatmoney.com slash radical.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.100]   URL, slip me for a moment.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.220]   expatmoney.com slash radical

[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.100]   It's a great event, great price.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.920]   Come spend a week with me
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.160]   talking about this stuff in person.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.980]   But let's get to the meat
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.380]   of what I want to share with you.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.880]   Before I go into the details
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.300]   of why I left the USA,
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.320]   I want to talk about
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.400]   a few comments on current events
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.980]   and current events in my own life.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.680]   Thank you for your patience
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.060]   with the paucity of podcasts
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.860]   that I have released over the last two weeks.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.780]   The reason there have been no shows
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.600]   during that time
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.760]   is that my family and I have been traveling.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.780]   And we're on the tail end
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.940]   of a six-week world tour
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.300]   that I dreamed up
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.380]   as part of my attempts
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.300]   at world school.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.840]   And I'm sure you've all heard
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.540]   of the term world schooling.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.080]   I don't know about you,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.260]   but I've always been fascinated
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.640]   with the topic of world schooling
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.200]   as someone who has great interest
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.680]   in education broadly,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.500]   schooling specifically,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.700]   homeschooling, et cetera,
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.700]   and has the resources
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.400]   and time and interest
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.980]   and inclination to try to give my children
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.680]   everything I possibly can give them.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.180]   I've always been fascinated
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.240]   with this term world schooling.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.280]   It's such an event
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.140]   and it's such an evocative term.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.260]   It immediately pictures something in your mind
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.640]   that I think most of us would say,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.020]   yes, if you've traveled abroad,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.600]   no matter the age,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.040]   no matter the format of your travels,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.200]   I'm certain you've learned something.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.000]   Foreign travel is one of those things
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.840]   that has a tendency to open our eyes
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.360]   in a way that few other things can
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.160]   and broaden our horizons,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.220]   broaden our perspectives,
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.120]   challenge our concepts.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.100]   And when you compare that
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.260]   to the almost,
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.320]   certainly dull experience
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.140]   that you had in school,
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.980]   there's just a sharp comparison
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.020]   and contrast there
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.320]   between the evocative nature
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.340]   of world schooling
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.940]   and government schooling.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.340]   One is dreary and dull
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.980]   and death by lecture.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.480]   The other is exciting
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.840]   and innovative and imaginative.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.020]   But I myself have always been
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.440]   a cautious,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.540]   implementer of world schooling
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.420]   versus a full-throated supporter of it.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.600]   I respect a lot of people
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.640]   and a lot of the different theories
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.420]   that people have
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.120]   in the homeschool community,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.040]   some of the different things
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.840]   that people are testing.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.940]   I think it's lovely to have
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.680]   these things tested and tried.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.640]   And one of the more interesting
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.120]   segments of the population
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.940]   of home educators
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.220]   that I've studied a lot,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.220]   has been those of the so-called unschoolers,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.680]   those who basically try to throw out
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.180]   everything associated with
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.040]   formal forced schooling
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.660]   and substitute something else
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.460]   that is frequently dubbed unschooling
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.420]   for lack of a better name.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.560]   And one segment of that
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.000]   is often world schoolers.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.880]   And I just imagine, you know,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.320]   a kid sitting under a palm tree
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.760]   in Nicaragua eating coconuts,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.720]   surfing on the beach every day
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.200]   and, you know,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.520]   his mom saying,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.980]   well, we unschool our children.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.020]   I'm not pillorying this.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.500]   This is truly what many people talk about.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.540]   And I've always been quite skeptical
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.500]   of the educational value
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.780]   of pure traveling,
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.520]   pure, you know, going around.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.980]   A museum is great,
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.680]   but a museum does not substitute
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.240]   for a well-written book
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.700]   explaining things at a level
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.300]   of understanding
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.180]   and understanding
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.900]   and depth
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.680]   that a well-written book,
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.760]   even a textbook, can provide.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.120]   And I think that a lot of times
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.620]   what I observe that many world schoolers do
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.160]   is they substitute laziness
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.260]   for depth of education.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.480]   And I myself think that academics
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.880]   are very important.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.640]   But I do think that
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.420]   so-called world schooling
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.280]   can be and probably should be
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   an equivalent of
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.760]   an extraordinarily useful tool
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.640]   in the hands of
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.600]   a thoughtful educator
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.860]   because
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.840]   I'm convinced that the simplest way
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.940]   to think about learning
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.740]   is simply the process
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.060]   of making connections.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.180]   And those connections,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.420]   I mean that in a metaphorical,
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.340]   abstract sense,
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.240]   but I also mean it
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.400]   in a quite physical sense
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.160]   of connecting neurons in your brain.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.940]   The more layers there are
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.420]   to our knowledge
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.640]   and to our life experience,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.660]   the more we can learn
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.940]   because the more connections
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.840]   we can make.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.380]   And so the process
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.660]   of forming connections
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.740]   to information,
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.440]   to knowledge,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.620]   is the simplest understanding
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.420]   of education.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.840]   And the process
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.020]   of forming connections
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.440]   is best done
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.800]   when we meet ideas
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.160]   in a variety of contexts.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.840]   Rather than always
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.860]   in the same context.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.280]   Learning researchers, for example,
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   have done some experiments
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.360]   and they claim that
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.520]   your learning
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.800]   of new material
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.680]   will be more effective
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.640]   if your physical place of study
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.800]   changes
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.920]   at different times.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.700]   So this is obviously hard
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.280]   because we all know that having one place
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.880]   that we study every day at one desk
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.220]   and a good routine is probably
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.140]   the cornerstone of good learning,
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.440]   having a good routine.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.060]   But the truth is,
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.420]   if on Monday you study
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.120]   at the desk in your home
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.900]   and on Tuesday you study
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.780]   at the desk or the table
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.420]   in your backyard
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.680]   and on Wednesday you study
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.500]   at the local library
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.620]   and on Thursday you study
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.480]   at grandma's house
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.380]   and on Friday you study
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:42.900]   at school,
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.120]   then you'll retain information
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.800]   more effectively
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.480]   because there's variety
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.280]   and diversity
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.800]   in your study location.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   And so you want to have
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.680]   variety.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.800]   And I've found this so frequently
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.480]   with my own study
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.180]   of things like foreign language vocabulary.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.720]   If you just have a word
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.900]   printed on a word card
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.280]   that you're trying to learn,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   you could see that word card 20 times
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.460]   and it sometimes just doesn't sink in.
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.580]   But then the instant you see it
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.540]   in the wild
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.140]   or the instant you hear it
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.340]   in a movie you're watching
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.780]   or a book you're reading,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.340]   then immediately that word
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.960]   is cemented on your brain forever
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.520]   and you never need the word card again.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.780]   And so seeing,
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.180]   seeing things in different contexts
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.440]   is very, very impactful.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.700]   And this is, I think,
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.100]   the opportunity of world schooling.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.100]   If you are an educator
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.080]   of significant motivation
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.880]   and significant financial means
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.680]   and you can employ the world
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.720]   as part of your educational process,
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.860]   then I think your ability
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.040]   to build connections to knowledge
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.380]   and to experience it,
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:57.420]   to learn about it,
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.460]   to learn about it,
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:57.940]   to learn about the meaning
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.540]   in your students' lives
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.300]   is going to be so much more powerful.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.020]   And I think that is something
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.560]   that those of us who care deeply
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.220]   about these subjects
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.160]   should experiment with
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.260]   and should work on.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.600]   And so this six-week tour
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.120]   has been part of my own efforts
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.740]   to do that.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.320]   I've dismissed the idea
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.440]   at this point
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.420]   of the value of a lifestyle
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.000]   of nomadism.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.720]   When I was younger,
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.440]   I wanted to be a backpack worker,
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.600]   a digital nomad
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.880]   traveling around with just a backpack.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:27.500]   And I was like,
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.740]   maybe that's appropriate
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.760]   for a single guy.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.780]   I still don't think
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.540]   it's very effective as a lifestyle.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.820]   But maybe that's appropriate
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.420]   as a single guy,
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.940]   but that's too much work for parents.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.580]   And I don't think
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.700]   that long-term constant nomadic travel
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.900]   adds much of anything positive.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.420]   I think having relatively modest trips
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.280]   done frequently,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.080]   but having a good solid home base
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.320]   where you can build academic connections
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.980]   on a deep academic level,
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.780]   and then reinforce those connections
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.440]   with experience,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.840]   and then go back and reconnect them
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.640]   with deep academics,
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.540]   to me that seems the ideal way
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.360]   to approach a topic like world schooling.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.400]   And maybe in some other format,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.420]   I'll share more of what I've done
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.080]   to try to make good use out of it.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.840]   We've tried to read various books,
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.480]   living books,
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.360]   about each of the destinations
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.380]   that we've had in mind.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.180]   The destinations have all connected
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.340]   to something that we've studied.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.400]   And then we've tried to really embrace
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.100]   all of the world schooling opportunities
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.800]   along the way.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.340]   So I'll share some of that at another time.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.500]   But the relevance at this point in time
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.900]   has to do with the importance
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.520]   of internationalization.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.220]   So my family and I recently found ourselves
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.440]   caught up in the events,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.160]   the tragic events happening in Israel.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.480]   We weren't personally in danger in any way,
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.620]   but we were scheduled on this trip
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.720]   to travel to Israel.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.320]   That was a core component.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.840]   I myself have never been to Israel.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:56.940]   I've never been to Israel.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.640]   I have been wanting to go for many years,
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.920]   but it has not worked out.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.700]   And so finally I worked it out.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.380]   I said, okay, we're going to go to Israel.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.360]   And I had everything planned, everything booked.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.980]   It was going to be a great trip.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.260]   So we went to Italy first.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.720]   And our plan was to fly from Italy to Israel.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.000]   Italy is important because obviously
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.740]   with our studies of the Roman Empire
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.060]   and Latin language and classical history, etc.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.940]   Italy is a core component of that.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.920]   And it's just very powerful.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.560]   It's very powerful to be in some of the Italian cities
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.820]   where so much happened
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.260]   and see those things to provide relevance to your studies.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.480]   But then along the way,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.920]   lo and behold, all the events in Israel unfolded.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:49.200]   And challenging, a horrific situation.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.640]   And I had to decide, okay, what do we do?
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.460]   Do we continue to go?
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.900]   After all, I'm not going to go.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.940]   I'm not that concerned about my own safety in Tel Aviv.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.560]   You're probably pretty safe in Tel Aviv
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.720]   and in Jerusalem, etc.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.400]   But the logistics of travel were insurmountable.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.820]   Airlines canceling flights, etc.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.420]   So I canceled the Israel trip.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.240]   And instead of that, we went to England.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.480]   And I was struck by how easy that decision was
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.560]   based upon all of the modern tools,
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.560]   all of the modern implementations,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   all of the modern travel,
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   all of the modern travel,
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:27.600]   all of the modern travel,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:27.680]   all of the modern travel,
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.340]   and simply being able to travel the world freely.
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.480]   And then along the way,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.640]   as you'll hear as I talk about in this series
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.520]   of why I left the USA,
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.960]   I've worked with so many people
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.840]   who simply don't have that privilege,
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.240]   don't have that easy time of coming and going.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.720]   As a US citizen,
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.120]   I just canceled my flights here,
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.600]   booked some cheap flights,
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.100]   flew from Italy to England,
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.740]   and okay, here we are in England.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.480]   We'll go ahead and do this portion
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:56.540]   of the trip.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.360]   And quickly adapt and adjust.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.420]   No prior planning necessary.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.540]   Nothing other than grab a few airlines,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.700]   charge them with a credit card,
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.160]   book an Airbnb, boom, done.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.960]   As an American citizen,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.800]   I can enter England for six months.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.000]   I can come back and forth.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.120]   I'm pretty much footloose and fancy free.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.840]   And what an amazing circumstance to be in.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.420]   Now contrast that with the challenge
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.600]   just of this very day.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.420]   This very day, we see the video
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.900]   of from, where was it?
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.000]   Dagestan, Russia, something like that,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.080]   where the local population
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.420]   of I think Russian Muslims
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.880]   finds out that there is a plane
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.540]   flying from Tel Aviv to their city.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.920]   And they go and they stop the plane
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.720]   to basically waylay anybody
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.720]   who has an Israeli citizenship.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.080]   And here they are taking away a guy
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.140]   with a mob,
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.040]   baying for blood,
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.120]   a guy who's got an Israeli passport.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.060]   Unbelievable.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.460]   And so this stuff
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.400]   hits close to home
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.500]   in terms of your ability
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.020]   to come and go internationally,
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.100]   your ability to move around the world freely.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.420]   And there have been many times,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.580]   while right now,
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.740]   it's easy for me to travel
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.420]   with a US passport,
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.800]   and I'm grateful for that,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.200]   there have been many times
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.440]   in which that's not the case.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.440]   Just recently, I was reminded of the story
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.640]   of the hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.720]   back in 1986.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.780]   And there was a heroic flight attendant
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.000]   named, I don't know how to pronounce her name,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.900]   Neeraja Banat,
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.200]   who she was, she had to go,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.040]   she was told, she did a bunch of things,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.280]   but she was told to go and collect
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.260]   all of the passports of all of the passengers
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.720]   because the hijackers there in Pakistan,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.680]   the hijackers were hunting for Americans.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   And she hid the passports of the Americans
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.180]   and saved many, many lives with her bravery.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.520]   She was killed protecting the lives of,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.400]   I think, three children later in the hijacking.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.920]   And just, you know,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.580]   one among many stories of times
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.720]   when your American passport
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.440]   can have you being hunted.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.040]   And so this is not something
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.880]   that is only applicable to Israelis,
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.420]   in the current world.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.860]   So my summary simply is to say that
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.860]   this stuff matters.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.740]   And it matters in all times,
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.700]   but especially in these times.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.260]   And so when I share with you
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.480]   why I left the United States,
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.800]   I just want you to think about your own situation
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.640]   and think about what that would mean
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.740]   to the specifics of your life
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.120]   and how you could increase more resiliency
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:55.820]   in your international life.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.660]   And I want to share with you my reasons
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.040]   as to why this became important to me.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.600]   And as always,
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.000]   even as I teach in my international escape plan course,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.660]   just know that you don't have to,
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.180]   you don't have to move abroad.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.700]   Let me share a little bit of that backstory with you
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.480]   to set the context for my reasons.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.040]   When I chose to leave the United States,
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.420]   it was not part of a long-term plan.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.180]   I didn't plan to move abroad and stay abroad.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.640]   I was not looking for, you know,
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.280]   a new home.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.800]   I didn't have a list of all the countries of the world
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.960]   that I was going to go to.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.980]   It was much more spontaneous than that.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.920]   As it so happens that my wife and I
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.300]   had reached a point in our lives,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.860]   we'd lived in one place for a long time.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.820]   We'd had a bunch of babies
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.700]   and we hadn't traveled much.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.600]   And we decided, you know what,
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.100]   let's go travel around the United States.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.260]   And part of it is we were open to,
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.920]   there was nothing wrong where we lived from.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.100]   I just, where we were from.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.660]   I just couldn't see the long-term future.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.580]   I couldn't see my life.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.860]   You know, 30 years later living in that place.
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.820]   And I wondered if there was something else
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.020]   or something different that I should be pursuing.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.840]   So we got rid of our stuff,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.400]   bought a camper,
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.680]   started traveling around the United States.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.720]   All of that is chronicled here
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.500]   in the annals of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.760]   And on that trip,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.080]   we were open to moving to different places.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.280]   We found some places that we thought were interesting,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.160]   cultures that we liked,
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.080]   specific things we were looking for.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.100]   I had a list of places that I wanted to go and check out.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.280]   But along the way,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.100]   there wasn't any,
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.340]   specific kind of urging that we had
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.360]   to choose this particular place
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.780]   and set up shop there.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.160]   Along that trip,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.040]   we conceived a baby
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.020]   and we needed to be somewhere for the birth.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.220]   Didn't want to have a baby in an RV.
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.200]   And so we were heading back towards Florida.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.320]   And then I was thinking about birth tourism.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.140]   And I said to her,
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.400]   hey, you know what?
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.820]   We should do this
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.360]   because I had grown uncomfortable
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.740]   with the idea of relying solely on one country,
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.200]   the United States,
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.380]   as I share my,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:55.820]   my reasons.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.480]   And I thought,
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:56.920]   you know what?
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.460]   Let's do this.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.720]   We went abroad for birth tourism.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.920]   When we went abroad,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.680]   I didn't know if we'd be gone a few months
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.920]   or if we'd be gone a few years.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.940]   I didn't have any strong commitment to it.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.100]   I didn't see how it would be possible for me
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.260]   to make those kinds of plans.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.740]   And so we went abroad,
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.300]   had a baby.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.100]   Things worked out.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.840]   So we were there for a while
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.180]   and then COVID hit soon after we had the baby.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.300]   And it just was easier to stay where we were.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.020]   We had a good living situation.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.900]   We had everything we needed.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.760]   We had a good network.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.380]   And so we stayed where we were.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.080]   After a couple of years abroad,
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.400]   we went traveling again.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.720]   And then unfortunately,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.000]   those travels ended prematurely
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.740]   because I underestimated
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.020]   the COVID closures in the world.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.740]   I thought that COVID was done.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.820]   We went traveling,
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.900]   discovered that most of the world didn't agree with me
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.900]   and traveling was very unpleasant.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.440]   And so we moved back to the United States.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.140]   I had the intention of staying for a while.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.140]   And then for a variety of circumstances,
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.420]   turns out that about three months later,
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.400]   we left again and moved abroad again.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.040]   And so in that kind of,
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.400]   in those wanderings,
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.140]   I've gone through a lot of the emotions,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.280]   a lot of the experiences
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.840]   that many of you have not.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.040]   And that's the perspective
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.340]   that I'm sharing this from.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.700]   And if I had to guess,
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.340]   I would guess that in the future
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.100]   we'll wind up back in the United States.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.180]   But I don't have a clear plan for that at the moment
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.100]   for reasons that I'll share with you
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.400]   in this series.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:24.880]   So let's get,
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:25.620]   let's get to it.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.500]   Before I get to the three reasons
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.160]   why I left the United States,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.040]   I'm going to begin
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.660]   with some of the reasons that I,
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.000]   that are not part of my reasons,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.500]   but things that I hear frequently.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.160]   There are various things
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.960]   that I frequently hear from others
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.900]   as good reasons to leave the United States
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.060]   or good reasons to leave,
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.180]   you know, Great Britain
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.960]   or wherever you happen to be from
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.640]   and go abroad.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.060]   And these are not my reasons,
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.240]   but I want to talk about them.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.440]   The first reason that I did not leave the United States
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.900]   was for a lower cost of living.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.540]   Many people who live
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.840]   in a wealthy,
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.720]   developed country
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.140]   believe that
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.680]   if they just go
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.220]   to another place,
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.140]   they just move to Mexico
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.680]   or move to Costa Rica,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.460]   move to Panama,
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.680]   then they'll just have a lower cost of living
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.060]   and everything is going to be great.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.620]   And they sit down
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.140]   and look at the cost of buying a house
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.580]   or the cost of renting a house
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.120]   or the cost of having a maid,
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.600]   et cetera.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.120]   And they say,
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.140]   this is going to be fantastic.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:22.860]   I'm going to do this.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.880]   I'm going to go and have a lower cost of living.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.920]   And that you can go
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.520]   and get a lower cost of living.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.780]   And there are some limited circumstances
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.680]   in which I myself would recommend this.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.880]   But those circumstances,
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.300]   I would say,
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.400]   I would recommend them generally
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.100]   for a short time,
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.140]   a limited duration.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.460]   And I don't think that moving abroad
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.960]   is strictly necessary for them.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.440]   And done poorly,
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.420]   moving abroad can
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.700]   do very poorly for you.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.460]   So, for example,
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.900]   I've commented that,
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.460]   you know,
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.760]   if I found myself wanting to start an internet business
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.380]   and I just lost my job,
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:04.900]   I was broke,
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.040]   I want to start an internet business.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.980]   One thing I would consider would be
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.120]   hopping on an airplane,
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.340]   going to Thailand
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.000]   and finding a place I could live
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.740]   for under $1,000 a month
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.640]   so I could start my internet business.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.160]   And there are many people who've done that.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.280]   I say Thailand specifically
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.020]   because interestingly,
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.540]   there's been quite a community
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.520]   of digital entrepreneurs
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.560]   who've gotten together
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:23.840]   in,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.140]   in various places in Thailand
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.600]   and built kind of an incubator
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.780]   ecosystem
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.640]   where they support one another
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.940]   and engage with one another.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.340]   Bali is quite popular for this.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.120]   Other little hubs around the world
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.280]   that you can plug into.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.940]   And many times people go
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.060]   and they celebrate the fact
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.160]   that they don't need much money
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.560]   and they're,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.780]   and it sounds like a dream.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.180]   Here we are making money online,
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.880]   hanging out in a beautiful place,
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.240]   making,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.600]   spending only a little bit of money
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.860]   and it sounds like a dream.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.520]   And I think in some cases,
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.580]   that can be appropriate.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.500]   But there are a few big cautions
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.520]   that I have observed
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.120]   that you really want to be thoughtful
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.280]   and careful about.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.200]   Caution number one is this.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.900]   When one category of expenses goes down,
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.100]   it's frequently the case
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.960]   that another category of expenses
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.000]   increases significantly.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.540]   So the guy who gets on an airplane
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.240]   and flies to Thailand
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.140]   so that he can live in,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.400]   with,
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.140]   with living expenses
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.900]   at less than $1,000 a month,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.200]   will not infrequently find himself
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.140]   on an airplane
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.280]   flying back to the United States
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.080]   for family holidays
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.720]   or for an important connection
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.400]   with somebody
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.660]   and spending thousands of dollars a year
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.160]   in airfare
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.780]   that he wouldn't otherwise have spent.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.200]   I'm not saying
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.940]   that the living expenses are not lower.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.840]   They can be.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.940]   But often you wind up
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:48.960]   spending more money
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.980]   on another category.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.600]   And so you want to be
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.820]   really thoughtful about this.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.360]   It's a big,
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.800]   big concern.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.580]   The second thing is that
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.720]   in lowering expenses,
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.880]   especially if you're trying
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.040]   to be hardcore frugal,
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.840]   when you lower your expenses,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.880]   frequently,
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.180]   the actual lower costs
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.920]   come from a downgrade
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.300]   in lifestyle.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.160]   So, yeah,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.580]   I moved from a place that,
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.340]   you know,
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.920]   I moved from a place
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.940]   where it was super expensive
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.060]   to a place where the,
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.060]   the,
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.960]   the rent is cheaper.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.440]   But in reality,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.200]   I'm taking a big downgrade
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.040]   in terms of
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.940]   moving from a tier A city
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.500]   to a tier B city.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.000]   I'm moving from
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.420]   a big comfortable apartment
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.500]   to a small apartment,
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.860]   downgrading my appliances,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.140]   downgrading many things.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.280]   And this is much more palatable
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.100]   to some people
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.680]   in an international context
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.740]   than it is in a domestic context
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.600]   because it feels exotic.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.660]   If you,
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.160]   could live in Louisiana
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.840]   or Mississippi on the beach
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.820]   and not have an air conditioner,
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.360]   it would feel like you're suffering
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.060]   because you know the American culture
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.520]   and you're suffering
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.540]   without an air conditioner.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.000]   But on the other hand,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.080]   if you move to,
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.000]   you know,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.160]   the beaches of Costa Rica
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.680]   and you don't have an air conditioner,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.960]   then you say,
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.900]   well, this is exotic.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.060]   This is what the locals do.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.000]   You have the same experience,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.740]   but because it's exotic,
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.400]   it's different.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.500]   You're more willing
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.540]   to accept hardship.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.580]   You're more willing
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.000]   to accept,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.520]   accept a downgrade in lifestyle.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.280]   And that's fine.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.080]   And in fact,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.140]   this is a strategy
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.100]   that I frequently recommend to people
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.220]   as a way of getting out
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.460]   and a way of resetting.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.120]   But you should face it honestly.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.380]   And I'm not,
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.700]   I'm not denigrating the strategy.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.160]   I,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.920]   I do frequently recommend this.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.300]   You'll have a family
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.260]   that's kind of stuck
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.460]   in their,
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.420]   their lifestyle
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.940]   and they've got a certain house
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.040]   at a certain cost of living.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.360]   They got a certain neighborhood,
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.440]   a certain set of friends.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.960]   Everything's basically locked in.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   And then for whatever reason,
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.680]   could be on the downside,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.740]   there's job loss,
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.280]   could be on the,
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.600]   just we're not getting ahead
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.000]   and there's no career prospects
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.800]   or something like that.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.900]   We're not saving any money.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.860]   We're not making progress
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.780]   or is treading water.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.780]   And yet the family is unwilling
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.760]   to make any significant changes
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.900]   because of the fact that
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.000]   we're kind of just stuck
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.740]   in this lifestyle.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.000]   It would feel like deprivation.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.940]   Well, one of the strategies
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.680]   I turn to in situations like that
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.260]   is to say,
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.780]   how can you make it exotic?
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.180]   How can you move into a motor home?
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.940]   How can you move into a car?
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.920]   How can you move abroad?
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.040]   And in so doing,
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.220]   transform your entire budget.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.680]   But due to the fact
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.800]   that it feels exotic
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.760]   and you're substituting
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.040]   all these other kinds
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.980]   of life experiences,
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.240]   you kind of cut yourself
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:36.980]   free of this
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.200]   and you embrace the hardship
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.660]   as, hey, this is fun
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.240]   and this is different.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.400]   And then you cut your expenses
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.520]   in half so you can finally
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.320]   start to get ahead
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.400]   and make progress
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.500]   towards your financial goals.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.520]   This is a useful tool,
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.160]   but it's also one of those things
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.420]   that people don't think about.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.200]   They don't recognize
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.600]   hey, you know,
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.420]   I'm saving money,
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.180]   but I'm saving money
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.520]   because of a lifestyle downgrade.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.840]   So let's approach it open-mindedly.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   One of my other big concerns
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.040]   of people who move to
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.480]   a lower cost of living place
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.980]   is many times
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.420]   that causes them
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.580]   to stop being productive.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.680]   And this is a big concern
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.600]   that I have for young men,
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.360]   especially,
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.220]   and I've seen it
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.940]   even in my own life.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.520]   I'm very sensitive to this
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:23.900]   because it has been
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.320]   and it has affected me personally.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.360]   If you need to make,
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.140]   you know, $15,000 a month,
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.560]   $10,000 or $15,000 a month
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.360]   in the United States
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.520]   to live a great lifestyle,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.780]   and then you say,
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.580]   I'm going to check out
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.080]   and I'm going to go
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.780]   where it's cheap,
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.800]   where I can live on,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.440]   you know, $3,000 a month
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.740]   or $5,000 a month,
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.980]   and you go
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.360]   and you start living on less,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.200]   then you drop your income down
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.020]   from $15,000 a month
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.880]   to $8,000 a month.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.180]   And you say,
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.480]   look, I don't have to work so much.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.820]   The problem is
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.620]   then you get used
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.940]   to not working so much
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.880]   and your skills
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.680]   start to atrophy
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   and your motivation
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.560]   starts to wane
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.720]   and it gets easier
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.380]   to drink beer
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.100]   and sit on the beach
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.320]   at 3 o'clock in the afternoon
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.220]   instead of hustling.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.000]   Do that for a decade,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.320]   especially during the decade
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.540]   of the most important
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.660]   building years
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.740]   of your own life.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.780]   All of a sudden,
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.480]   you wake up
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.400]   and you look around
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:10.920]   and you say,
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.800]   I haven't,
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.940]   I'm not where I should be.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.140]   I'm not where I'd like to be.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.060]   I'm not where my peers are.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.180]   And that's really concerning.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.960]   And you look at it and say,
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.860]   well, but wasn't I better off?
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.160]   Well, sort of.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.800]   But you walked away
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.180]   from the hustle and grind
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.580]   way too early.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.240]   And now the idea
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.900]   of going back
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.980]   to the hustle and grind
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.620]   is very,
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.300]   it's just not as appealing.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.400]   You don't have as much energy.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.960]   You've got more demands on you,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.840]   et cetera.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.720]   And so I get really concerned
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.820]   about people just pursuing
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.800]   low cost of living
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.620]   for its own sake,
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.000]   especially on a long-term basis
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.200]   versus buckling down
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.740]   and improving their skills
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.840]   and increasing their
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.500]   earnings,
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.300]   working harder,
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.060]   building the connection,
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.860]   building the business,
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:57.260]   et cetera,
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.200]   that can support
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.160]   a higher cost of living.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.540]   And I keep a sign on my wall.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.700]   I'm not in front of my wall right now,
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.260]   but basically it says something like,
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.380]   it's not expensive.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.580]   You just can't afford it.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.420]   And that's your problem, right?
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.320]   It's not expensive.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.940]   You just haven't made it cheap
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.060]   and it's your problem.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:17.840]   So fix it.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.720]   Fix that.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.840]   Don't complain
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.000]   that it costs too much money.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.140]   Be upset that you don't have more of it.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:23.820]   Money,
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.480]   is relatively straightforward
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.240]   to come by.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.280]   And so if you can go get some,
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.660]   then you can fix
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.420]   some of those issues.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.180]   And so I don't want to labor
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:33.820]   on that today,
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.180]   but it is a concern.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.360]   So lower cost of living
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.360]   is not one of the reasons
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.560]   that I myself left.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.300]   There are benefits to it,
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.700]   but I've probably experienced
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.200]   more of the downsides
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.220]   of lower cost of living
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.000]   than the upsides.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.260]   I think the best way
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.420]   to handle lower cost of living
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.460]   is if you need it
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.120]   for a specific period of time.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.720]   So you say,
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.900]   I'm stuck where I'm at.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.240]   I need to reset.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.760]   I'm going to move abroad
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.620]   for one year.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.340]   And during that year,
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.820]   I'm going to do A, B, C, and D.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.160]   I'm going to enjoy
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.040]   the lower cost of living.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.200]   I'm going to stash money.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.460]   And after one year,
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.280]   I'm going to go back
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.340]   and do this.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.700]   Or I need, you know,
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.620]   relief until I can get out of that
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.500]   or until I can get this
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.380]   internet money going and et cetera.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.160]   But lower cost of living
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.180]   for the long term,
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.860]   I don't think is a great goal.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.420]   It should be a means to an end
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.280]   rather than an end
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.140]   in and of itself.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.240]   You don't want to get accustomed
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.680]   to low earnings,
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.540]   low productivity,
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.960]   relaxed lifestyle, et cetera.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.380]   I don't see that stuff
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.400]   as being positive.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.460]   And you want to be really careful
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.580]   about putting yourself in that.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.620]   It's kind of the same problem
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.500]   with welfare, right?
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.660]   We know that welfare damages men.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.320]   When you're given free money,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.060]   easy money, easy life,
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.020]   you lose your motivation.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.600]   You lose your motivation.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.140]   And yet the same thing happens
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.200]   when you set yourself up
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.040]   on easy street.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.860]   All of us would much rather
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.740]   sit on the couch and eat salty foods,
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.760]   salty, high calorie, fake food
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.720]   that somebody else paid for for us.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.760]   But if you start sitting on the couch
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.920]   and eating salty, high calorie food
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.240]   that someone else bought for you,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.660]   then a few months later,
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.660]   you can't get up off the couch.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.860]   And so most of the good things
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.020]   in life worth having
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.140]   require you to go out
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.480]   and do something hard,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.460]   to face something difficult.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.400]   And yet in so doing,
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.740]   that changes you.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.500]   It changes you for the good
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.540]   and makes you capable
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.040]   of going and doing more things.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.440]   So lower cost of living
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.640]   is a useful tool,
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.140]   but it's not a goal.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.300]   Now, my other comment
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.100]   on lower cost of living
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.720]   is that what I've frequently said
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.400]   to many people
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.900]   who I've consulted with,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.360]   et cetera,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.820]   is before you necessarily move abroad,
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.300]   look for lower cost of living
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.440]   in a context you know.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.720]   You could,
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.380]   I think the cheapest possible lifestyle
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.520]   you could live
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:53.720]   is a low cost of living.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.240]   It would be to get yourself
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.000]   a little single wide
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.360]   in Mississippi somewhere,
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.680]   Alabama,
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.380]   some rural part of southern
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.660]   or western United States
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.920]   out in one of the desert places.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.040]   I think you live there
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.420]   cheaper than almost anywhere else
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:10.920]   in the world
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.500]   with a higher degree of safety,
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.380]   higher degree of security,
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.100]   higher degree of convenience
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.060]   than most places.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.120]   Speak the local language.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.140]   It's all easy.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.260]   Everything is great.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.940]   I think you should really consider
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.980]   those kinds of things
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.300]   before you just jump
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.860]   and move abroad.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.300]   Moving abroad solves
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.940]   a different set of questions for you.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.280]   And the biggest one
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.540]   that it solves in that situation
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.020]   is the exotic nature
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.360]   and the challenge.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.980]   And so that can be a great,
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.440]   it can be a great tool for that.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.020]   But lower cost of living
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.500]   was not one of my reasons.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.600]   Second reason that I want to discuss
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.180]   that is not one of my reasons
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.540]   was concern about the collapse
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.440]   of the United States
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.620]   or various,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.920]   sub-collapses within that, right?
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.920]   A collapse of the dollar,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.180]   collapse of the economy
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.740]   or hyperinflation, et cetera,
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.520]   things like that.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.220]   I believe that these are all
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.580]   real risks and threats
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.680]   and they are worth preparing for.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.340]   And internationalization
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.700]   is an effective way of preparing
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.920]   for many of those things.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.340]   But that's not why I specifically
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.180]   left the United States.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.480]   The reason for that has to do
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.800]   with my
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.660]   my
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.660]  , my inability to accurately time
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.660]   any particular catastrophe such as that.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.060]   I grew up,
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.300]   and for whatever reason,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:36.900]   I was always,
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.300]   I guess probably the sensationalism,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.100]   I was always interested
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:43.040]   in the collapsed people and whatnot.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.400]   And so I've read a lot of literature
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.220]   from probably about the 1970s
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.040]   where it really got going
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.820]   in the United States.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.860]   But at the end of the day,
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.660]   very few people want to face the fact
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.500]   that the collapse has been predicted
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.620]   for 50 years
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.100]   and it hasn't happened.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.400]   Now, that doesn't mean
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.760]   that it won't happen.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.300]   After all,
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.400]   anything which cannot continue
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.020]   will eventually stop.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.720]   So we know that
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.860]   anything that will,
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.740]   that cannot continue
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.640]   will eventually stop.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.600]   So some form of collapse
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.200]   or crisis or whatever
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:16.880]   is inevitable.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.160]   But we don't know when.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.780]   And what I came to the realization of
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.340]   in my own life,
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.180]   is he is a fool
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.220]   who gives up that
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.640]   which he can never get back,
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.940]   meaning the time of his life,
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.340]   to pursue something
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.200]   that he doesn't want.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.500]   And so because of my interest
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.240]   in preparedness
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.180]   and survivalism over the years,
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.800]   I've watched a lot of people
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.500]   that seems to me
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.320]   they walk away from really good life
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.220]   out of a hardcore extreme fear,
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.600]   go and put themselves in a situation
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.060]   where their life stinks,
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:53.880]   but they're,
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.000]   and it only works
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.060]   if everything goes wrong.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.380]   And they wind up,
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.000]   in some cases,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.480]   miserable.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.020]   Or they wind up just doubling down
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.040]   and a few decades later,
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.680]   I ask, you know,
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.980]   are you really living the life you want?
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.920]   Wouldn't you rather go back
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.800]   and do something different
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.560]   with those decades?
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.200]   I think where this impacted me the most
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.640]   was when I,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.800]   a number of years ago,
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.740]   I followed quite closely
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.680]   a lot of people in the,
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.880]   I'm just gonna call it
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.920]   the preparedness space,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.960]   where they were focused very much
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.000]   on move out of the cities,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.540]   move to a rural place, et cetera.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.800]   And there were three leaders
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.040]   in that space that I looked up to.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.900]   I appreciated some writers,
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.000]   some content creators, et cetera.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.060]   And I'm not gonna name their names.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.740]   It's not important,
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:43.860]   but there were three of them.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.820]   Fascinating thing to me,
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.520]   all three of them moved from the city
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.540]   out to the country
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.600]   because of collapse of society,
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.260]   blah, blah, blah,
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:52.820]   you know,
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.560]   imminent catastrophe situations.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.640]   All three of them,
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.100]   their wives left them
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.660]   after several years of being gone,
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.600]   divorced them,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.640]   and moved back to the city.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.160]   And I thought to myself,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.200]   isn't that like the perfect example
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.000]   of catastrophe?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.900]   Now, none of them,
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.620]   as far as I know,
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.220]   I stopped following them at that point.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.280]   A man who won't,
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:14.600]   you know,
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.220]   a man who will destroy his family
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.560]   and let that happen
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.540]   over, you know,
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.340]   belief in the collapse of,
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:22.760]   you know,
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.300]   American society to me
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.180]   is not a man who has anything worthwhile to say.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.720]   So I haven't followed any of their stuff since then.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   But it just shows like this fundamental
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.020]   lack of perspective
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:46.600]   of the imminence of certain catastrophes
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.500]   versus others.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:52.200]   Here you are with your wife leaving you
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.420]   because you moved to the middle of nowhere
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.420]   and you were worried about societal collapse.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.740]   And then a decade later,
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.300]   society is still ticking along.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.580]   And yet you've had a collapse of your own society.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.880]   And so all of that,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.700]   much of that kind of collapse thinking and whatnot,
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.800]   while it may be true,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.380]   it needs to be judged very carefully
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.500]   and held in perspective.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.720]   I think the best way to approach this
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.640]   is using,
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.020]   using the motto of Jack Spirico,
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.960]   the guy who runs the Survival Podcast.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.580]   His motto from the inception of his show,
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.560]   his tagline of his show was
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.460]   helping you to live a better life
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.280]   if times get tough or even if they don't.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.080]   And all of your plans should reflect
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.480]   the ability for you to love your life
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.460]   to the extent possible
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.480]   or to be enthusiastic about the way
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.820]   and the where and the how you're living.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.120]   Now,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.580]   if everything is going great,
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   as well as if everything
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.460]   doesn't go great,
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.600]   you don't want to go and do something
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.280]   that you would only do
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.380]   if you,
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.240]   if there were a collapse of some kind.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.900]   You don't want to go and lose years
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.120]   and decades of your life
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.500]   over something that probably won't happen
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.000]   because collapses when they happen
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.800]   are very slow
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.620]   and they're very uneven in their effects.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.520]   And so I believe in the importance
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.280]   of preparing for financial collapse,
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.360]   catastrophe, crisis, et cetera,
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.240]   hyperinflation.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.060]   I believe that's all important.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.080]   I got a whole course on it.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.540]   But you don't have to go and move abroad
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.860]   for 35 years waiting for the collapse.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.840]   And I think that thinking
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.180]   is poisonous to progress
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.120]   because what it causes you to do
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.060]   is to rejoice over bad news
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:46.100]   and to rejoice over conflict
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.460]   because it's going to vindicate you in some way.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.360]   When a man makes a commitment,
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.060]   a commitment to a certain position,
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.360]   then it causes him to only see things
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.700]   that are going to vindicate him.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.120]   And so that guy who moves to the middle of nowhere
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.900]   and because he's concerned
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.440]   that the world is going to fall apart,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:15.200]   all he sees is confirmation of his viewpoint.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.920]   That's why he won't move back to the city
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.080]   to keep his marriage together
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.940]   because for him to do so
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.140]   would mean to admit that he was wrong.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.960]   And he won't do it.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.800]   And so all he sees is non-stop
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.480]   ever-continuing confirmation
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.380]   of his viewpoint.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.300]   He won't see anything else
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.200]   because as human beings,
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.220]   we don't believe what we see.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.480]   We see what we believe.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.260]   We all do.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.300]   And so we need to be really thoughtful
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.340]   and careful about forming our beliefs
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.680]   because we're going to see what we believe.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.320]   We're not going to believe what we see.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.980]   It's a very unusual process
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.660]   and it's a very unusual personality
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.180]   and or skill
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.980]   that allows someone
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.140]   to disassociate himself from his beliefs
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.940]   and study something factually.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.560]   I believe it's something
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.960]   that we can develop in ourselves.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.620]   I would like to think
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.000]   that I've done that to some degree.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.120]   I don't want to fool myself
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.880]   because of course,
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.440]   maybe I just am seeing what I believe.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.720]   I believe that about myself
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.760]   and so therefore I see it.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.300]   But I do my very best
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.760]   and that's all any of us can do
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.600]   is try to account for this weakness
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:21.760]   that we have.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.340]   That we have as human beings.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.000]   But we need to be very careful
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.180]   and try our best
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.900]   to disassociate from our own interests
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.540]   in a scenario
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.600]   and study the facts
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.460]   as best we understand them
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.820]   in order to do our best
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.580]   to make a plan with those facts
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:43.220]   for any decision that we're making.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.000]   And if we do that,
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.600]   then I think we can make better decisions.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.840]   If your thinking process
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.800]   requires you to believe something negative,
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.480]   be very thoughtful about that.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.580]   And even if you think
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.840]   that's the most likely outcome,
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.620]   in many cases,
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.380]   you should reject that thinking.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.260]   Let me give you an example
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.780]   of a heuristic that I use
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.920]   and I teach my children
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.120]   that I think is really important.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.980]   I do this because
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.280]   in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 in the Bible,
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:15.740]   it says,
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.900]   love believes the best,
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.360]   a once-in-one translation of love.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.040]   And I believe that I,
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.580]   as a Christian,
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.740]   all Christians,
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.960]   should always believe
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.040]   the very best thing possible
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.920]   about other people.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.720]   And I'm imperfect at it.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.760]   It's very hard to do in some circumstances,
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.500]   but I continually remind myself.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.940]   So let's say that something happens to you.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.200]   Someone offends you.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.460]   Someone says something to you
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.120]   or whatever.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.100]   Someone does something.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.140]   You need to always discipline yourself
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.540]   to believe the very best interpretation
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.360]   of that event
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.560]   that you can possibly believe.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.400]   And so if somebody cuts you off in traffic
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.080]   and you have two choices,
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.940]   choice A is this guy is a careless jerk.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.240]   Choice B is this guy is driving
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.420]   his pregnant wife to the hospital
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.380]   and she's screaming,
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.740]   the baby's coming.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.340]   And that's why he cut me off.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.000]   Then just discipline yourself
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.340]   to automatically choose B.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.680]   Man, that guy is sure in a hurry.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.420]   He must have some good reason to do that.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.160]   Now we all know that this is probably not true
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.420]   in 80% of the cases.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.540]   But the beauty of this kind of thing
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.800]   is it frees you
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.780]   from any kind of negative reaction.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.960]   So if somebody cuts me off in traffic
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.000]   and I just say,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.800]   man, that guy sure is in a hurry.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.300]   He didn't see me.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.040]   You know, he must have a real reason
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.160]   why he's got to go there.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.720]   Then it completely transforms
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.480]   my experience of that event
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.440]   in a positive way.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.280]   Now there's zero emotional stimulation.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.580]   There's zero reason.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:50.080]   And if I have anything negative to say,
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:50.680]   it's just gone.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.520]   It's gone.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:51.820]   It's gone.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.300]   Now notice that I said
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.160]   we want to believe
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.080]   the very best possible version
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.460]   of anything that you can believe.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.920]   So if somebody,
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.040]   if somebody, you know,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.200]   cuts you off in traffic,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.260]   stops his car,
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.900]   gets out and starts waving a gun at you,
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.040]   I'm not saying you tell yourself
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.600]   some ridiculous thing
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.800]   like he's waving a gun in my face
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.820]   and he's waving a gun in my face
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.980]   because his wife is pregnant
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.500]   and he needs to go to the doctor.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.140]   He needs to go to the hospital.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.000]   Believe that this guy is going to kill me
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.020]   and so what do I need to do in this situation?
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.700]   But at the end of the day,
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.460]   discipline yourself to find
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.880]   the best possible version
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.320]   of the events that you can.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.740]   And so after you deal
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.400]   with the immediate threat of that situation,
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.260]   you're going to say,
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.220]   what happened?
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.960]   And you're going to do your best
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.500]   to find a way to believe the best
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.240]   about other people.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.640]   If you're wrong in that direction,
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.780]   let's say that you know you're wrong
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.720]   in that direction.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.040]   And 20% of the time,
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:51.480]   people are going to say,
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.220]   they're going to abuse you.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.060]   They're going to take advantage of you
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.360]   in some significant way.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.680]   You are so much better off
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.640]   having that mindset about life
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.920]   than you are the other
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.340]   where you go through life
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.780]   thinking that people are out to get you.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.840]   I know some people that are like this
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.220]   and I try to believe the best about them
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.920]   and I also try to disassociate myself
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.320]   from them as much as is possible
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.220]   because it's toxic.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.780]   They go through life
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.500]   thinking that people are out to do them ill.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.280]   And it's like they,
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.020]   actively choose the worst possible
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.300]   explanation in any situation.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.900]   The best that I can believe about those persons
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.380]   is that they just don't recognize
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.980]   what is happening to them
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.200]   and they haven't asked me for my input on it.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.460]   And so this is,
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.460]   forgive me,
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.700]   I've lost my train of thought.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.260]   I guess what I was trying to say is
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.440]   that if you,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:51.880]   you can,
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.680]   I think,
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.140]   forgive me,
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.880]   I think what I was trying to say is that
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.200]   if you can look at circumstances,
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.820]   you can possibly interpret them in a positive way,
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.080]   then do that.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.700]   And so look for reasons why things are getting better.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.920]   Look for reasons why collapse won't happen
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.260]   and then just prepare,
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.860]   but don't commit your life
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.240]   to that kind of negative perspective.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.840]   Prepare for what is possible
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.140]   while believing in what is,
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.420]   what you want to happen.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.980]   And I think that even if you're wrong,
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.520]   it's a much better solution.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.060]   And I'm not criticizing people
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.420]   who genuinely believe the best that could possibly happen
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.380]   is total collapse.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.880]   But those people will make their decisions
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.920]   and they'll be happy with it.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.540]   They'll live in a rural area because they love it
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.980]   and they'll be thrilled with it.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.320]   You know, James Wesley Rawls,
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.600]   who I've interviewed various times on the show,
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.020]   is absolutely convinced that collapse is certain.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.500]   And he is living a great life
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.840]   and he wouldn't change anything
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.760]   because his day-to-day lifestyle
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.180]   is a lifestyle that he loves.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.500]   He lives in a beautiful place,
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.980]   has a wonderful family,
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.160]   has a great business,
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.740]   works hard every day,
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.500]   enjoys the outdoors.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.440]   He wouldn't change a thing
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.240]   even if collapse never happened.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.080]   And so I'm not accusing you of
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.180]   saying you shouldn't go
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.820]   and live in a beautiful place.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:09.640]   What I'm saying is
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.740]   believe the best that you can
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.320]   and constantly challenge those beliefs.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.420]   So I didn't leave the United States
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.260]   because I was concerned about
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.560]   the collapse of the United States.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.820]   I didn't leave the United States
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:21.260]   because of the collapse of the United States.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:21.800]   I didn't leave the United States
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.680]   because of my concern
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.100]   over growing government debt.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.640]   That's kind of a subset of collapse.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.380]   I don't think that the growing government debt
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.460]   is likely to relate to end in so-called collapse.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.120]   Now, decisions could change.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.060]   But at the moment,
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.160]   I think that that is bad
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   and it'll have many harmful effects.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:41.800]   It's not great,
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.060]   but it's not going to lead to a two weeks
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.840]   and the whole country collapses type of scenario.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.740]   That's fiction stuff.
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.120]   That's not how the real world operates.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.560]   That's not how countries collapse in general.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.820]   If circumstances continue to change,
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.620]   then of course we will assess further.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.600]   Those are not some of the reasons
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.120]   that I left the United States.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.700]   Final reason I did not leave the United States.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.160]   I did not leave the United States
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   because I had some kind of beef
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.520]   with the culture of the United States.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.640]   I do think in many cases
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.320]   this is probably the best reason
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.240]   to leave your country
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.300]   is because you don't like the culture
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.320]   and you just don't fit in there with you.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.000]   It doesn't fit in with it.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.260]   I've mentioned,
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.480]   I don't think I've said it to him,
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.660]   but I've mentioned this
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.960]   in the context of Andrew Henderson,
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.920]   the nomad capitalist.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.660]   I think one of the reasons
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.180]   that the best reason
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.540]   that Andrew left the United States,
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.480]   and he said this publicly,
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.860]   I've just listened to enough of his stuff
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.920]   to hear it clearly,
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.980]   is that he never felt comfortable
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.160]   as an American.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.080]   And one of the great things for him
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.440]   was that he has found
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.420]   much greater peace in his life
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.540]   and in his persona and his culture
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.500]   by leaving the United States
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.480]   and not being an American.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.700]   And I think that's,
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.460]   I think that's fantastic
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.860]   that if you don't fit in your home culture,
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.360]   in your home country,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.960]   then you should leave.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.900]   And some of the best Americans
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.840]   that I have met,
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.580]   the people who most thoroughly embody
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.320]   the American spirit
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.260]   and American values, etc.,
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.840]   are those who have left their country
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.600]   and come to the United States
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.080]   because of what it offers them.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.840]   And they do not identify
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.020]   with their home culture
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.480]   and their home country.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.440]   They have nostalgia over it,
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.640]   but they don't want to be part of it.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.340]   And I think that's one of the best reasons
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.320]   to leave a country.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.900]   But that was not my personal experience.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.780]   I'm very thoroughly culturally American.
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.640]   Regardless of my U.S. citizenship,
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.760]   I'm very thoroughly culturally American.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.760]   I appreciate the United States so much.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.200]   And I'll never be anything else.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.880]   I can't imagine culturally
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.600]   how I could change to the degree
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.240]   that I wouldn't connect
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.960]   with being an American.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.160]   I've always been successful
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:48.940]   in the United States.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.620]   I've always felt good
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.740]   and comfortable in the culture.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.800]   And so even though that culture
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.360]   has massively changed
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.460]   and I don't really recognize
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.060]   the country of my youth anymore,
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.920]   what I do observe
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.940]   is that there's another 100 million people
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.300]   in my home country
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.080]   that pretty much think and act
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.220]   just about like I do.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.740]   And when you think about a tribe,
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.800]   having a tribe of 100 million people
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.760]   that pretty much think and act like you do
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.820]   is way more powerful
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.500]   than having a tribe of 100 million people
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:20.860]   in the world.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.120]   It's a tribe of a few thousand people
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.500]   that think and act like you do
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.780]   in some other corner of the world.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.760]   And so this is my thing
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.200]   that when I come back to
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.680]   those cultural issues
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.900]   that affect all of us,
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.180]   simply that where am I going to go
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.200]   where I'm going to find
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.420]   another 100 million people
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.800]   who think and act like I do
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.380]   for the good.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.980]   And for all of the frustrations
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:42.920]   that I have about
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.120]   quote unquote my culture,
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.140]   I've got more cultural compatriots
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.400]   in the United States of America
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.540]   than anywhere else in the world.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.480]   And so I'm going to find
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.800]   and so I didn't leave
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.420]   to run away from those people, etc.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.460]   And I think that many people
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.460]   probably shouldn't leave
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.380]   for that reason.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.020]   Again, I think COVID
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.220]   was a great example of this.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:04.020]   That what you saw in COVID
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.720]   was you saw a splitting of cultures
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.380]   based around an issue.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.160]   And while of course individuals
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.660]   all have their own,
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.520]   you know, ability to think,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.360]   ability to process,
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.520]   ability to discern, etc.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.300]   At the end of the day,
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.160]   people split widely
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.440]   into several camps.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.460]   And those camps
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.520]   often found themselves,
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.060]   their lives impacted by
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.760]   not who their president was,
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.300]   but who their governor was,
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.380]   or who their mayors were,
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.760]   who their county sheriffs were.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.440]   And by living with like-minded people,
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.780]   you can live pretty well.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.820]   And so on a lot of the cultural issues
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.280]   that matter a lot to me,
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.460]   I don't want to, you know,
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.220]   brush my hands off and walk away.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.840]   I want to stay where I got
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.440]   100 million friends.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.840]   Or even if it's 30 million friends,
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.240]   or whatever.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.100]   When you recognize a country
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.800]   like my country that's so large,
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.540]   I think the third most populated
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.460]   country in the world,
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:03.000]   having 50 million people
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.400]   that think like you
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.120]   is going to be your biggest
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.640]   asset in the world.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.940]   So be careful before you walk away
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:10.580]   from that,
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.720]   especially long-term,
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.480]   for sure.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.440]   There are good reasons
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.560]   to live near friends.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.440]   And because of the tremendous diversity
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.820]   of living lifestyles
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.980]   and living conditions
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.980]   and places you can live
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.780]   in the United States,
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.520]   you can get around
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.400]   a lot of your friends
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.340]   and live a pretty happy,
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.260]   insulated life
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.300]   in the United States.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.120]   So that's another reason
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.380]   I didn't leave the United States.
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.380]   But I know that it's a reason
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.100]   that a lot of people
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.500]   are concerned.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.920]   In the next episode,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.100]   I'm going to get into
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.100]   reason number one,
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.860]   why I did leave the United States.
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:49.740]   And...
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.460]   And to be clear,
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.200]   this is not to invalidate
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.980]   any of these previous reasons
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:58.800]   as being enough
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.340]   for someone else to go.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.580]   At the end of the day,
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.520]   you choose your own life.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.560]   And any reason...
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.920]   You don't have to give anybody
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.400]   any reasons for anything that you do.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.960]   Just do what you think is best.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.660]   You don't have to justify it.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.700]   You don't have to justify it to me.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.180]   It doesn't...
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.400]   You just do what you think is best.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.700]   My goal is to talk you through
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:17.620]   some of my thinking
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:18.980]   so that you can have
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:19.720]   an external mirror
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.080]   for some of your own thinking.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.420]   And you can consider
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.460]   your thoughts.
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.020]   That's how I view content like this.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.060]   I like to hear
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:26.960]   how other people think
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.560]   so I can assess
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.280]   how much I agree with them,
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.140]   disagree with them,
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.860]   empathize, etc.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.980]   And this is a really good way
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.800]   to do that in a...
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.060]   It's a two-way conversation
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:39.380]   in which I do the speaking
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.240]   and you do the thinking.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.000]   And so my goal is just
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.160]   to clarify my thinking
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.320]   for you
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.380]   so that you can use that
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.240]   as a foil for your own thinking.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.820]   And then the last comment
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:49.320]   I want to make,
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.540]   is that the biggest lesson
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.340]   that I have learned
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.220]   in all of this
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.540]   has been
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.120]   that
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.720]   my own internationalization journey
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.680]   and what I've recommended
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.720]   to a lot of people
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   is not something
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.100]   that is either or.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.400]   It's not
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.800]   the way it was
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.480]   in the old days.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.260]   Just with my children,
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.040]   recently as part of our
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.660]   travels in England,
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.700]   we were talking about
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.920]   Ireland, England,
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.100]   the Irish potato famine, etc.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.680]   And I was just thinking about that
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.180]   afresh.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.000]   Like here you are
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.220]   in a country where
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.720]   your food has been gone,
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.420]   everything's been taxed away from you
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:26.320]   and you're starving,
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.300]   literally starving.
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.720]   And you,
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.000]   so many Irishmen
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.560]   went to America for that.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.160]   Huge, huge waves of emigration.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.160]   To emigrate in those days
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.040]   meant leaving and cleaving.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.700]   Leaving and separating
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:44.340]   and you were done.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.900]   You may find an Irish group
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.340]   or community in the United States
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.660]   for you to join in
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.040]   but you weren't going back.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.920]   There was no, you know,
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.520]   pop on an airplane and go back.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.920]   There was no people with, you know,
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.960]   money who could just
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.320]   go back and forth and visit.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.620]   I mean, but my experience
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.300]   of internationalization
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.160]   had been very different.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.800]   I can buy airline tickets.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.520]   We can go back
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.960]   in 12 to 24 hours
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.960]   from any corner of the world.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.260]   I can be back in anywhere, anywhere.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:15.160]   And so we have a very different lifestyle
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.780]   than anyone did back then.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.700]   From a paperwork perspective,
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:19.640]   that means,
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   that things are in some ways harder
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.520]   than they once were,
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.560]   but in some ways easier
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:25.420]   than they once were.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:29.020]   And so virtually all of internationalization
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.660]   can be done in stages.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:32.880]   And as I share with you,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.060]   or as I already shared with you
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:35.540]   in the beginning,
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.620]   my own internationalization journey was,
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.000]   hey, let's go abroad and have a baby.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.440]   And then after a few months abroad,
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.820]   baby was doing well.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.900]   We thought, hey, things are good.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.220]   Let's stick it out for a bit.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.760]   I stuck it out for a bit,
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.900]   decided to leave,
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.320]   went traveling.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.180]   That didn't work.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:49.620]   Decided to go to a hospital.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:50.580]   Decided to go back to the United States
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.880]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.380]   Decided to change again.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.700]   Left again.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.040]   And so you can do that if you need to.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.100]   And you don't have to make
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.140]   these long-term decisions.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.540]   So be wary of building this stuff up
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:02.480]   too big in your mind,
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.620]   thinking that any of this is unchangeable.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.640]   It's not.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.200]   And you'll learn more about it
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.460]   by doing it yourself,
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.460]   step by step.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.640]   And the same thing
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.500]   with all the specific steps,
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.220]   the legalities of getting a residence somewhere
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.920]   and becoming all the stuff,
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.600]   getting a residence,
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.860]   getting a citizenship, et cetera.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.440]   It's just step by step.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.120]   And very rarely
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.360]   does it ever require you
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.000]   to make these huge decisions.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.720]   It's just little decisions
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.600]   moving along the way.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.700]   And every stage
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.460]   gives you infinitely higher levels of freedom.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.480]   Step one is get a passport.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.720]   If you don't have a passport
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   from your home country,
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.800]   get a passport.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.780]   Do it today.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.240]   Get a passport for all your children.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.040]   That in and of itself
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.920]   gives you infinite levels of freedom
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.660]   as compared to people
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:48.660]   who don't have a passport.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.560]   And so start the process today.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.960]   In closing,
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   I want to remind you
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.520]   that if you're interested in this stuff,
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.420]   I have a course called
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.800]   internationalescapeplan.com
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.620]   where I teach step-by-step internationalization
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.200]   using exactly this philosophy,
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.720]   phase one, phase two, phase three, phase four,
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.160]   and how you can start
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.500]   with a passport and a credit card.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:09.940]   That's it.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.820]   Phase one.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.940]   So go to internationalescapeplan.com,
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:14.940]   sign up for that course.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.020]   Huge feedback on that
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.900]   of how much people have learned from it.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:19.500]   You've heard some of them
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.780]   on Q&A calls, et cetera.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.840]   Number two is I want to encourage you
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.040]   come to my event in Panama in January,
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:26.840]   January 2024.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.480]   Sign up at expatmoney.com slash radical.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.800]   It's going to be a great event.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.060]   Even if you just come
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.580]   because you want to hang out with me for a week,
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.120]   come and do that.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.600]   I'll be fully available for an entire week.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.680]   This is not a family event.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.640]   My children won't be there.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.300]   I'll just be there hanging out with you.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.260]   And we'll talk about all this stuff.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.380]   And we're using Panama
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.400]   as a starting point
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.080]   because Panama is a great solution
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:49.180]   for many people.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:49.420]   It's a great solution for many people.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:49.860]   It's a great solution for many things.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.840]   But our conversation and our discussion
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.460]   and our planning is not limited to Panama.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.760]   It's not just about Panama.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.920]   That's just a way of having an excuse
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.420]   to profile a particular destination
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.240]   that has certain things to offer
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.420]   and then giving us an organizing benefit
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:03.700]   to the tour.
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:04.840]   So sign up.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.180]   Bring your wife.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.240]   Bring your husband.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.260]   Make it a couples event.
