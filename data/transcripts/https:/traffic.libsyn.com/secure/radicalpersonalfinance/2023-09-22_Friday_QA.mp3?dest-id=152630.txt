[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860]   Hey, Radicals, remember, time is short for you to sign up for my event coming up in January
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.880]   of 2024.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.380]   I'm hosting an investment tour, a private event, one-week tour of Panama with my friends
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.240]   Mikhail Thorup and Gabriel Custodiat.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.840]   If you have any interest in internationalization generally, meaning that you would like to
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.040]   learn about second passports, multiple residencies, foreign bank accounts, foreign asset management,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.280]   et cetera, to internationalize your life so you're not entirely dependent upon one
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.680]   nation, you should come to this conference.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.340]   We're going to be talking about Panama specifically, but our sessions and our discussion and just
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.360]   frankly the time together is going to open up a world of possibilities beyond that.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.720]   Sign up today.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.200]   Go to expatmoney.com slash radical, expatmoney.com slash radical.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.240]   Sign up for the conference.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.780]   Time is short so we can get our final reservations and everything done.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.000]   I don't know specifically the date that we're going to close off registration.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.880]   I need to talk to my partners about that, but time is short.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.660]   Go to expatmoney.com slash radical.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.460]   Sign up.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.140]   Come hang out with me and my friends for one week in Panama.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.100]   I think it's a great deal.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.360]   Everything all included.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.780]   We work out all the details for you.

[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.100]   Sign up today.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.880]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.120]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.260]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.680]   I'm your host.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.400]   Today is Friday, September 22, 2023.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.780]   We are doing Friday.
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.260]   Friday Q&A today, although it will not be a live Q&A.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.080]   I don't have the recording technology this week to record a live show.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.020]   So I sent out a message to the patrons of Radical Personal Finance and said, hey, I
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.900]   can still do Q&A, but I can't do it live.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.840]   Send me your questions.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.440]   And I have a lot of questions coming in.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.560]   So I'm going to take today's show, answer several questions, and then I will answer
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.600]   all of the rest of the questions over coming days on individual shows here and there interspersed
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.140]   through the standalone podcasts.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.960]   Thank you all very much for your questions.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.940]   If you would like to gain access to a Friday Q&A show, you can do that by going to

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.320]   That will give you access to these Friday live shows when I do those or things like
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.660]   today where we have a question.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.860]   First question comes in, Joshua, how do I make the decision on whether to either fix
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.660]   up or sell as is a house I bought that needs lots of work?
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.780]   I don't think I would be able to recoup losses.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.000]   Either way, but I'm not happy in the house and would honestly prefer to rent at this
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.300]   point because of all the headaches it has given us.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.040]   I feel I have not been able to focus on going back to work full time as planned since the
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.880]   house needs so much attention.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.820]   I've been a stay at home mom for the past six years with a 15 year old and a four year
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.020]   old.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.100]   We are really feeling the financial effects lately along with tons of regret.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.200]   So this is a really important question and I appreciate the details.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.600]   Obviously,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.660]   I don't have a live kind of back and forth here,
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.560]   but I think this particular listener has given me enough details that I think we can do a
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.700]   pretty good job with it.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.600]   The first thing is I think the most useful mental heuristic for you to use in all of
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.880]   your decision making is that of zero based thinking.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.400]   I learned this when I was a teenager from Brian Tracy who drilled it into my head and
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000]   I'm trying to drill it into as many other people's heads as possible.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.120]   Zero based thinking is basically asking yourself a question that goes something like this.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.100]   Knowing what I now know,
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.040]   if I had to do this all over again,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.660]   would I do anything differently?
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.220]   So knowing what I now know about this particular house that I own,
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.520]   if I were going to do this all over again,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.900]   would I do anything differently?
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.340]   And I think what is obvious from this particular question is simply that knowing what I now know,
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.780]   if I had to do this all over again,
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.860]   I would not buy this house that I'm living in.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.880]   And that's useful to make it clear because we need to start with the first step.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.780]   To start by being clear with ourselves on the ultimate goal of where we want to be.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.520]   Knowing what I now know, if I were going to start this business over again,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.960]   would I do anything differently?
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.360]   And again, notice that I'm trying to use kind of soft and welcoming language.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.020]   I'm not saying I definitely would do something differently.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.160]   I'm not trying to say I have to get completely out of it.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.880]   I just want to know, like knowing what I now know,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.200]   if I were going to start this business over again, would I do anything differently?
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.340]   Or knowing what I now know, if I were going to,
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.960]   enroll my child in this school again, would I do anything differently?
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.160]   Or knowing what I now know, if I were going to hire this employee again,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.400]   would I do anything differently?
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.760]   And it's a good way of getting at what you actually know about the situation,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   while not falling prey to all of the emotions of,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.560]   I have so much time and energy invested into this house.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.020]   I have so much money involved in this house, et cetera.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.040]   One of the biggest fallacies,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.080]   especially with regard to money that we are prone to committing is that of the sunk
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.200]   cost fallacy, where we look at all of the costs that we have sunk into a certain project or into
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.720]   a certain decision, be they costs of time, be they costs of money, be they costs of energy,
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.280]   be they costs of broken dreams.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.020]   And we say, but I've got so much riding on this, I have to make it work.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.520]   And yet that's a fallacy because the past and all of those costs that we have sunk into something
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.440]   are, they don't exist anymore.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.560]   Once they're done, they're done, they're gone.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.220]   The past does not exist.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.000]   And so we have to discipline.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.020]   Our minds constantly perpetually to think only about the present and where we are looking to go
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.600]   in the future.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.560]   And I have found those, that type of question to be the most illuminating way to get at that.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.040]   Knowing what I now know, if I were to get into this house again, would I do anything differently?
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.520]   So what we see from this listener's question is the answer is an absolutely clear and unqualified.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.560]   Yes, I would do something differently.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.680]   The answer is I'm not happy in the house and I would honestly prefer to rent at this point
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.840]   because of all the headaches it, meaning this house has given us.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.920]   So we understand that we're not happy in this house.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.280]   I'm not happy in this house and I would prefer to rent given all the headaches of this house.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.740]   So let's break down the decision-making criteria a little bit more orderly.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.780]   And the first question we ask,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.280]   is there a way that I could be happy in this house?
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.660]   Because notice the zero-based thinking question didn't say I have to sell the house and move.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.960]   Knowing what I now know, if I were going to do this all over again, would I do anything
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.380]   differently?
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.200]   The answer might be absolutely.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.780]   I would completely gut and transform this house.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.680]   Maybe I love the location.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.360]   Maybe I love the neighborhood.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.860]   Maybe mom and dad live across the back fence.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.600]   My best friends live across the road.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.540]   On the other side, this is an up and coming neighborhood where we can easily walk downtown
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.980]   and have a beautiful dinner three nights a week with our family.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.380]   And we just love being in this place.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.420]   But the house is a wreck.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.440]   So then, of course, we consider the situation.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.360]   Knowing what I now know, if I had to do it over again, I would completely transform this house
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.920]   on the inside and make it into a place that I would like to be.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.260]   Or the answer might be obviously no.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.600]   Knowing what I now know,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.000]   if I were to do this over again, I would never buy this house.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.800]   I hate the neighborhood.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.720]   I hate the neighbors.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.060]   I really despise the bones of the house itself.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.380]   There's no way I could transform the house.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.540]   In which case, the answer is obviously move on and sell.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:41.220]   Now, when the zero, the magic question, the zero-based thinking question reveals to you
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.940]   that you should do something differently or that you would do something differently if
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.780]   you had to do it over again, that does not mean that you now have to be stupid.
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.360]   For example, if you had to do it over again, you would have to do it over again.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.400]   You would have to do it over again.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.440]   You would have to do it over again.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:50.500]   You would have to do it over again.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.560]   You would have to do it over again.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.600]   You would have to do it over again.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.660]   You would have to do it over again.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:59.040]   For example, knowing what I now know, if I had to get into this job again, I would,
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.360]   or if I had to get into this career again, all over again, I would never get into this
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.640]   career.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.500]   That doesn't mean that today I need to turn in my resignation with no backup plan, nothing
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.980]   else that I'm going to do and walk out the front door and flip the boss a bird on my
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.420]   way out.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.700]   Those aren't necessarily the right things.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.940]   Rather, the question is designed to say, okay, what would I do differently again?
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.640]   I would go in a different direction.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.920]   I might go ahead and stick out the job for a couple of years while I'm retraining, while
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.220]   I'm interviewing, and then when I have another job lined up, a little bit of money in the
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.940]   bank, then I'll make an intelligent transition.
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.340]   The goal is to get out of the situation, but the goal is to get out of the situation as
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.580]   quickly and as intelligently as possible.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.760]   In order to do that, you need to collect the information.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.540]   You might have three scenarios in this case.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.540]   Scenario A would be, what would be necessary for me to make this transition?
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:56.160]   this house, the kind of house that I would want to live in. So you might sit down, analyze the
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.060]   bones of the house, figure out what you like about it, what you don't like about it, make a budget,
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.560]   maybe invest a couple hundred or thousands of dollars into having somebody draw up some
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.580]   renovation plans, shop those plans around with a couple of contractors, get a couple of quotes,
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.220]   et cetera. That might be some thousands of dollars very well invested into seeing if this is a house
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.040]   that we could make better. And if you knew that your price tag for fixing this house was, say,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.660]   $50,000 and you really like a lot of things about the house, it's just, you know, it needs
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.260]   renovation desperately or it needs landscaping or it needs something, but you like the neighborhood,
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.020]   you like the location, et cetera, then now we know it's $50,000. And when you go through the
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.760]   exercise of switching houses, you can burn through $50,000 in no times and realtor's expenses and
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.200]   closing costs and fix-up expenses and taxes and all kinds of things. And if you knew that you
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.460]   and then moving expenses, et cetera. So if it's $50,000 and you could make the house the one that
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:59.460]   you love, great. So that would be option A. Option B would be something like fix up the house and get
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.840]   it into top saleable condition. So what could we do to the house in order to make it very,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.180]   very saleable? Maybe you would spend $20,000 on the house, but it has the potential of
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.180]   having a final sale value of X number of dollars. So get clear on option number B. And then option
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.760]   C would be simply, let's just sell the house. We're not doing anything to it. We're just going
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.700]   to sell it to fixer-upper as is. We want out how quickly can we get out and at what price
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.780]   and get clear on those numbers. And then look at your alternatives. What would we do? Well,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.580]   sounds like we would move to a rental house. So what specific rental house would we move to? Why
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.380]   would we choose that rental house, et cetera? And what would we have available for us?
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.660]   When you write a question like this and you say things like, I want out of the house,
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.160]   how do I make the decision? But I want out of the house and I
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.720]   just like to go into a rental. It's a good sign that you already know what to do,
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.600]   but you're trying to either justify it to yourself in some way, or you're seeking
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.220]   some kind of external affirmation of the decision that you know is right. I'm not saying that's for
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.640]   sure the case, but a lot of times we already know what to do. But taking decisions and actually
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.400]   making decisions requires courage and commitment. And that can take some time.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.100]   If you want to justify selling this house, not doing anything,
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.720]   just getting out of it and then moving into a rental house so that you can go back to work
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:28.060]   and start making income, the way you justify that to yourself is based upon your new salary.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:34.040]   Let's say that you don't have any huge skills where you're not going to be making hundreds and
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.720]   hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, but let's just say you're going to be able to get
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.960]   a job making $60,000 or $80,000 a year. If you were able to make your transition out of this house
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.120]   fast and you have a job two months from now, you're going to be able to make a job that's
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:54.320]   then probably three months from now, you will recoup in your wages all of the money that
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.980]   right now has just been frittered away fixing up the house. I find that harnessing emotional
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.940]   energy is something really worth paying attention to. And if you have the ability to sit down,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.400]   recognize, I don't like the situation that I'm in and I want to change it,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:16.100]   and there's an opportunity to change it fast, even if it costs money, you could often make
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:22.460]   up for the money loss with the emotional energy of the new thing. So one of the reasons why with
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:28.080]   zero-based thinking, I think in many cases, people should move fast with it. If you recognize,
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.920]   you know, if I were going to start this business all over again, I wouldn't start it over again,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:37.380]   then cut your losses or profits, just cut things short and move on. Because if you can just quickly
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.360]   get a job and next month, you got a brand new job that you really love, or next month, you're
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.640]   working on a new business that you're excited about, and now you can pour in your 16-hour days
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.860]   of excitement instead of a place of obligation, then you can be in a good situation. Now,
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:56.400]   prudence demands that I point out that, of course, we should be cautious. We don't want to walk away
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.740]   from something that's good if we can make it better. We don't want to just say, well, maybe,
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.920]   maybe, and move, bounce from thing to thing to thing like a pinball, never actually building
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:16.060]   up momentum. I think a lot about that little meme graphic that you see online where there's two
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.880]   diamonds in the hill, and the guy is carving, carving, carving, and he's almost to that pocket
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.120]   of diamonds, and he just gives up because he's halfway into the hill and turns around and goes
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.460]   backwards. So there's times in which we just need to press through the difficult phases. But then
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.660]   there are also times in which we realize, I don't care about the diamonds. Even if I knew the
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:40.980]   diamonds were a couple of strokefuls away, this is not right for me. In which case, better off to go
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.180]   and buy a cow and start your farming instead of being a diamond miner.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:54.860]   So the way that you justify it to yourself is simply saying, honestly and clearly, let's move.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:00.520]   Let's simplify our life and our lifestyle, and let me get a job. Because in three months or six
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.360]   months, we'll not only recoup all of the financial cost of getting this house that this house is
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.660]   costing us with new wages, but the emotional benefit is going to be huge. And I think that
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.020]   when somebody is involved in a very, an all-consuming, all-consuming, all-consuming
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:22.560]   house, just the emotional benefit of moving into an apartment, being able to start over again,
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.880]   can be really, really a blessing. I remember when I moved out of a house that we owned into an
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:34.160]   apartment, and I was able to just be done with a lot of the stuff. It was a huge load off my mind.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.580]   I think homeownership is generally should be the default. It's generally the best thing long-term
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:45.880]   in terms of financial benefits, in terms of lifestyle benefits, etc. But the ability that
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.940]   you have to walk away from something that's just consuming your weekends, and now go and spend the
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.560]   weekend at the local park with a free heart, knowing that there's nothing hanging over your
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.540]   head, is really, really valuable. So that would be my thinking process, is practice zero-based
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:06.260]   thinking, lay out the alternative options, and if you'll discipline yourself to lay them out on a
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:12.420]   piece of paper with actual numbers involved, then the answer as to what you should do will probably
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.980]   be fairly clear to you. And once it's fairly clear, you can start to think about what you should do
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:23.280]   to justify it to yourself based upon focusing on the higher amount of income. If it turns out that
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.920]   justifying it to yourself based upon a new income is not, in fact, the right solution,
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.260]   that'll be obvious from putting it down on paper. And now you'll have more energy to say, no,
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.000]   we're going to spend the next three months getting this house into tip-top shape. We're going to work
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.940]   day and night. Everyone's in it all together. We're canceling everything else and use the
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.860]   emotional energy to get the house fixed, and then get it sold, and then move on to the next place.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:53.480]   Next listener question comes in. Can healthcare sharing ministries monthly shares be a business
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.700]   expense? Can there be a business expense in an S corporation, in a C corporation, etc.?
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:05.680]   So for the uninitiated, Christian healthcare sharing ministries are a type of organization
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:15.000]   that has been created to help people plan ahead for large unexpected medical costs. The way the
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:22.220]   is in the name. They are Christian, which means that these organizations, because they
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:30.280]   are religious in nature, they receive a small carve-out exemption from some of the other types
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:37.580]   of health insurance. And the religious basis of these programs creates basically an affinity group.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:45.920]   They are healthcare sharing ministries. So these are not for-profit businesses. These are ministry
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:53.160]   organizations that are trying to bring together like-minded persons who want to coordinate their
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:59.260]   health expenses together and basically, in a way, create an organization that helps all of the
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:05.340]   members collectively bear the load individually one with another. And then they are healthcare
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:11.080]   sharing organizations in that they are not insurance companies. The way that they work
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.900]   is that you have a membership in the organization, and then you have a membership in the
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:22.220]   organization. And then each month, you make contributions to the organization, and those
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:28.960]   contributions are funneled to somebody who has had medical expenses. The umbrella organization,
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.420]   or the parent organization, is responsible for coordinating those sharing contributions among
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:45.880]   the members. There are different ways that those coordinations happen. Sometimes you send your
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:55.840]   monthly share directly to the other member, but the organization takes an administrative fee for its
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.740]   usually about one month out of 12 worth of shares. So they take an administrative fee for coordinating
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:08.040]   everything, etc. And then the members support one another if they have large medical bills that are
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.000]   qualified for sharing among the members. That's what a Christian healthcare sharing ministry is.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.860]   I love these organizations because I believe that they are a great way to share with others.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:21.640]   They provide a really valuable and useful alternative to health insurance. However,
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:28.500]   they are not health insurance, nor are they a perfect replacement for health insurance.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.960]   Unlike health insurance contracts, where you have legal rights and the company has legal
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:40.080]   responsibilities, these organizations give you virtually no legal rights. You don't have any
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.300]   legal right to make a demand upon your fellow members that they pay for your health costs. All
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:45.840]   of your own health costs are paid for by your fellow members. So you don't have any legal
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.100]   personal health costs. You don't have any legal rights. You don't have any legal rights. You don't
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:53.460]   personal health costs are your responsibility and your responsibility exclusively. The organization
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:59.140]   can share those costs and other members can willingly donate to those costs. And you can
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:05.160]   have an expectation that in a time of need, they probably will do it. But this is not insurance.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:12.840]   And thus, you do not have any contractual or legal rights to obligate your fellow members to pay for
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.760]   your medical expenses. The reason I'm pointing this out,
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:24.900]   is that only health insurance is deductible as a business expense under the IRS regulations
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:34.740]   of related to health insurance. Contributions that you make to a Christian ministry are not
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.980]   health insurance contributions. They are not, excuse me, I misspoke. Contributions that you
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.800]   make to a Christian ministry are not health insurance premiums. And I'm not saying that
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.900]   under the tax laws, health insurance premiums to an insurance company are deductible. But
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:59.160]   contributions that you make to a Christian ministry are not deductible. And by the way,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.240]   they're not deductible as a charitable expense either. So the answer is no, they're not deductible,
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.840]   legally speaking, because they are not health insurance premiums. The fact that you yourself
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.500]   view them as synonymous with health insurance premiums doesn't matter. They are not health
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:15.780]   insurance premiums. They are not health insurance premiums. They are not health insurance premiums.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:23.760]   Thus, they are not deductible. So the letter of the law is fairly clear. I would guess that all
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:29.000]   across the United States, there are people who deduct those contributions as health insurance
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.860]   payments. And that only comes out when they are audited. But the letter of the law is absolutely
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:41.200]   clear that no, they are not health insurance premiums. People have tried to make an exemption,
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.700]   tried to adjust the tax code. But to my knowledge, that has not yet been accomplished. By the way,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.020]   why are they not charitable deductions? Well, they're not charitable deductions because
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:57.360]   you expect to have a good or a service in return for your contribution. So you expect those
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.580]   contributions to pay for your medical expenses. So you cannot deduct your contributions to the
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:08.940]   Christian Healthcare Sharing Ministry in the same way that you would your contribution to a local
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:15.740]   food pantry because you're expecting to receive benefit from the organization. So it's not deductible
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:21.240]   in any way. That said, it still can be very smart and still can be a wonderful way for you to provide
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.220]   for your unexpected medical expenses, which is the purpose of health insurance. But it is not a
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:37.580]   perfect replacement for health insurance. California's top casino and entertainment

[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:08.000]   Next question, Joshua, what is the scope of your periodic finance meetings with your wife?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.600]   That's a challenging question because it changes and it has changed over the years. And I don't
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:21.820]   think that is the type of question where my personal answer of what my wife and I do this
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:27.340]   month will be particularly helpful because what we do this month is different than what we did a
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.680]   couple years ago. And it's probably different than what we will do a few years from now. I'm not
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.620]   ducking the question, but I want to just emphasize that a marriage relationship is a relationship.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:44.500]   And in that marriage relationship, we want to understand the basic principles, but not fall
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.680]   prey to trying to use the same principles that we use to solve the same problems. So I think that's
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:23:15.660]   a really important question. And I think that's a really important question. And I think that's a really
