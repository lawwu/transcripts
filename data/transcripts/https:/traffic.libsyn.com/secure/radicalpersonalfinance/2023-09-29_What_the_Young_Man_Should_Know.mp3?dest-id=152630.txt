[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   Glancing out the window, I can see the subject, an eventual victim of this inquiry,
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.600]   dangerously perched in the crotch of an old chestnut tree about fifteen feet above the ground.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.400]   Should I rush out and tell him to get down, or should I let him be, hoping that he won't climb
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.720]   any higher, or, if he does climb any higher, hoping that he will not fall? It is probably
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.240]   all right, so I shall not bother him. Tree climbing is one of the things he has learned
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.500]   all by himself. There aren't many things he will have the fun of learning all by himself.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.020]   Most of the things he is going to learn will be hammered into him—Latin, and history,
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.100]   and grammar, and mathematics, up to the binomial theorem. I am not worried about his progress up
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.280]   the ladder from high school or boarding school to college, and from college to law school or
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.540]   medical school. It seems incredible that the young biped, now perched in the chestnut tree,
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.480]   will, some day, without stupendous effort on my part or on his, eventually graduate from
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.940]   college or even become a Ph.D. But he will, almost certainly. The strictly educational
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.960]   side of his life, once he gets his hands firmly on the lowest rung of that ancient ladder,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.020]   will take care of itself. What concerns me is something entirely different,
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.020]   a good deal more like tree climbing. I have never heard of a school or college that gave
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.680]   a course in tree climbing, and human life is full of useful accomplishments and rewarding
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.900]   experiences like tree climbing, like making a speech, for example, or being able to take care
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.560]   of oneself on a camping trip—abilities that seem to me at least as valuable as a knowledge of
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.680]   conjugations and the dates of battles, perhaps, if one is to become a self-sufficient, well-rounded
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.820]   human being, much more valuable. What are those abilities, skills, or accomplishments,
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.700]   those extracurricular proficiencies that every man should have in order to be a good man?
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.300]   To be rounded and self-sufficient? And when can he acquire them, and how?
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.800]   Let me return, without looking at him, for he is probably by now thirty feet above the ground,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.620]   to the seven-year-old imp in the chestnut tree. Impartially adding up to myself his
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.800]   skills other than tree climbing, I find that he cannot count money or give change,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.680]   that he is unable to tie his own shoelaces, that he would most certainly starve if,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.720]   left alone in a well-stocked kitchen, but, on the other hand, that he can perform a rather
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.700]   startling back-summersault off a diving board, that he speaks and understands elementary German,
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.000]   and can sit down at the piano and play with only a few mistakes a Mozart minuet.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.440]   Clearly, to this handful of skills and accomplishments he must add others,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.080]   many others, before he is even on the road to becoming a self-sufficient and
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.660]   well-rounded human being.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.300]   Leaving all formal subjects out of consideration, he should learn how to swim, handle firearms,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.900]   speak in public, cook, typewrite, ride a horse, drive a car, dance, drink, and speak at least one
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.500]   foreign language well. The list does not end there. There are several dozen mental and physical skills
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.360]   that I should like him to acquire. He will acquire some of them in the mere course of growing up.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.640]   He will acquire some of them in the mere course of growing up.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:57.620]   He will acquire some of them in the mere course of growing up. He will acquire some of them in the mere course of growing up.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.620]   It is up to me to see to it that he gets them, because they are skills of hand, eye, ear, or brain,
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.600]   which will enlarge, deepen, and ripen him as a human being.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.520]   But how, you may ask, can a young man be enlarged by learning to handle firearms?
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.020]   In what conceivable way will he be ripened by knowing how to cook or drink?
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.740]   Patience.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.260]   In asking what these things are that every civilized, intelligent,
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.600]   educated, and educated man can learn, I will ask him to learn how to cook and drink.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.940]   In asking what these things are that every civilized, intelligent, educated, young man should know,
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.600]   remember that I am thinking of skills, not contents.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.240]   Of outside interests and non-scholastic activities,
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.100]   rather than of the stream of Latin, Greek, physics, social science,
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.960]   Jacobean poetry, and elementary beekeeping,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.700]   which, from kindergarten to senior year,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.360]   will moisten, but not clog, the sieve that is his mind.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.380]   And so, let me hasten to turn away from the mountain range of modern education,
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.580]   which, from kindergarten to senior year, will moisten, but not clog, the sieve that is his mind.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.640]   And so, let me hasten to turn away from the mountain range of modern education,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.700]   which, from kindergarten to senior year, will moisten, but not clog, the sieve that is his mind.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.720]   And so, let me hasten to turn away from the mountain range of modern education,
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.860]   which threatens to cast its shadow over this discussion.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.480]   Let me mention once, and then not mention again,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.780]   the project method, John Dewey, intelligence quotients, and the Dalton plan.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.400]   The average high school or boarding school is not modern,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.780]   and will give your son and mine little beside formal education,
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.820]   and even more formal sport.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.320]   One will get him into college, and the other may leave him with a
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.740]   peculiarly atrocious form of hick-athletic patriotism.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.360]   If we parents do not supplement what is given to us,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.980]   what is given by the usual schools,
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.920]   our sons will come out of them mere Christian stockbrokers,
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.920]   with an abnormal craving for bodily exercise.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.780]   If we want our sons to be able to drive a car,
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.940]   speak French fluently, play the piano, set a broken leg,
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.740]   and make horses do their bidding,
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.940]   we shall have to look outside of these schools and colleges.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.540]   And I submit that he who cannot do these things is not completely educated.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.700]   The list of skills, as distinct from book learning,
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.140]   does not include the fact that they are not taught by the teacher,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.020]   but that they do not include mere parlor tricks,
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.140]   such as playing the ukulele, fortune-telling,
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.500]   a startling acquaintance with the insides of the Encyclopedia Britannica,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.140]   or other accomplishments whereby the fear psychology advertisements
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.600]   promise to make their victims the life of the party,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.040]   or a successful salesman in ten lessons.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.200]   And the list does not include the special aptitudes necessary to a man
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   in this profession,
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.900]   or the accomplishments which aim at the development of his character.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.780]   The skills I have in mind may fortify character,
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.720]   but chiefly as a byproduct.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.120]   They will make life richer and therefore happier,
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.800]   though happiness itself is usually a byproduct.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.260]   They are tools which will help a man to mine his own vein of gold
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.320]   and some of the gold in the world about him.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.180]   Some of them will save him discomfort.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.340]   Some of them will bring satisfaction and pleasure.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.500]   Some of them will help him avoid danger
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.700]   and give him the joy of life.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.180]   Some of them will give him the joy of mastery over animal fears.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.740]   Some are elementary and taken for granted.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.620]   Others are rarer accomplishments,
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.500]   not always striven for.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.080]   It seems obvious that our young man should know how to swim.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.520]   More specifically, he should know how to swim at least a mile,
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.180]   dive creditably,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.860]   and not feel panicky underwater.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.100]   No parents will disagree on this point,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.080]   since anyone who does not know how to swim
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.480]   stands in some danger of being drowned.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.180]   Swimming is valuable,
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.640]   not only to preserve life,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.340]   but because the fear of water is instinctive,
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.200]   and the most civilized man is the one who has conquered all
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.040]   that makes him afraid and that can be conquered.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.060]   Not only should our young man be able to dive courageously and neatly,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.280]   but he should be able also to revive those less skillful than himself
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.100]   by rolling them on a barrel and pumping their helpless arms,
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.260]   though I do not know how to do that.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.680]   Do not insist that every young man should be a lifeguard.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.540]   If he learns all the other accomplishments expected of him,
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.880]   he will have little time left for that.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.380]   He should be able to drive an automobile well.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.380]   By well, I mean far better than most people do now.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.200]   Of all our conveniences,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.900]   the automobile is the most docile
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.860]   and the most dangerous.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.940]   It seems to encourage a perilous discourtesy.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.700]   People who always answer letters,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.040]   smile when spoken to,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.840]   and rise when ladies enter the room
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.920]   think nothing of hogging the road or passing on a curve.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.880]   Our young man should drive safely or not at all,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.960]   and he should not be altogether helpless when a car breaks down.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.000]   He must know how to change a tire
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.180]   and offer some sort of diagnosis when the engine sputters and dies.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.080]   My list does not include a knowledge of how to pilot a plane.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.800]   Good pilots are born, not made.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.740]   A man should stay on the ground
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.820]   unless peculiarly,
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.600]   peculiarly fitted for the air.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.480]   He may be as air-minded as you please,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.500]   but unless he is air-bodied and air-reflexed,
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.740]   this modern skill should be left severely alone.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.360]   He ought to know how to clean, load,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.160]   and shoot a revolver or a rifle.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.580]   Someday he may have to in self-defense.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.100]   And shooting at a target is also good fun
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.460]   and an excellent discipline for hand and eye.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.660]   I should like my son to be able to hit a silver dollar at 50 yards.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.780]   And I should,
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.780]   but insist that he be able to manage a gun
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.060]   so as to injure no one but the target.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.980]   He must not be the kind of duffer who makes bystanders nervous.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.620]   I do not advance shooting as valuable
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.380]   for reasons of citizenship or military training.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.740]   I prefer that what he shoots at be inanimate.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.320]   He may develop a passion for shooting duck, grouse, and deer
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.460]   without my blessing,
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.880]   for it seems to me that the longing to assassinate wild animals
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.740]   is a barbarous and childish method of asserting the superiority
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.300]   of the human race and considerably less civilized than dueling.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.620]   As for self-defense,
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.440]   a man should certainly be able to take care of himself in a scrap.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.580]   He need not learn jujitsu.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.680]   Old-fashioned boxing will be enough.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.100]   He will get some of this in school.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.280]   He should get enough of it so that he can give and take
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.300]   a good smack on the jaw, whether in friendship or anger.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.560]   No matter how short the list of his accomplishments,
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.660]   this should be one of them.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.320]   Soviet Russians, who have seldom hesitated to use firearms
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.580]   against those whom doctrine forces them to consider enemies,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.900]   hold boxing to be brutal and forbid it to their young men.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.440]   Let us register our disagreement and pass on.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.700]   He should learn how to take care of himself in other ways.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.100]   He ought to know the rudiments of camping,
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.180]   how to build a fire, how to chop wood,
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.240]   how to take a cinder out of his eye,
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.420]   how to deal with a severed artery,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.660]   how to doctor himself for ordinary,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.620]   how to deal with ordinary ailments.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.020]   He should also be able to take care of other people in emergencies,
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.820]   to apply first aid, set a broken bone,
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.060]   revive a drunk or a victim of gas,
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.540]   deal with a fainting fit,
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.440]   administer the right emetic or antidote for a case of poisoning.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.860]   And he should be able to feed himself,
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.060]   to cook, not only because someday he may need to,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.700]   but because cooking is one of the fine arts
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.380]   and a source of infinite pleasure.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.460]   He should be able to scramble eggs,
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.100]   brew coffee, broil a steak,
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.520]   dress a salad, carve a chicken,
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.780]   and produce on occasion one first-class dish,
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.280]   such as onion soup.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.760]   The more he can do in these days
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.800]   of the delicatessen store and the kitchenette,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.640]   the better.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.600]   It is not effeminate, it is not beyond him,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.540]   and the best chefs are all men.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.360]   Our hands, originally the keys used by man's brain
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.640]   to unlock the whole wide world,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.540]   are in this age of patent appliances
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.380]   in some danger of withering through disuse.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.580]   A man may go through life,
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.000]   without using his hands,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.520]   for anything more difficult than
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.900]   gripping a golf club,
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.680]   signing letters,
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.740]   fumbling for coins,
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.580]   lighting a cigarette,
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.460]   opening a bottle,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.840]   and holding a telephone receiver.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.520]   When the furnace goes out,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.600]   or the radio goes dumb,
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.740]   or a door won't close,
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.600]   or a pipe leaks,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.560]   he has to send for an expensive expert.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.780]   Therefore, our young man should learn to be handy
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.000]   in repairing the trifling faults of his home.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.940]   Of course, he may live all his life in apartment houses
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.780]   and be spared such attention to trifling faults,
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.540]   but if he must live in a place where he can live,
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.820]   I had rather him do so from choice
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.060]   than from incompetence.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.440]   He should know how to use paintbrushes,
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.900]   a saw, a hammer, and other common tools.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.220]   It is much more fun than he might think.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.000]   It adds to his self-respect,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.480]   it satisfies the throttled manual ape,
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.840]   and it supplies one of his few contacts
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.420]   with the remote world of physical labor.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.120]   One of the best tools he can use
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.180]   is practically unknown among those
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.520]   who have not spent some time in a newspaper office
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.900]   the typewriter.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.360]   Our young man should also have a beautiful
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.920]   and distinguished handwriting.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.780]   He will not learn this in any school.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.260]   Schools are as likely as not to ruin
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.200]   whatever handwriting he might have had.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.700]   But handwriting should be reserved for special occasions.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.200]   The bulk of his writing,
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.300]   particularly if he is a professional man
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.480]   who has much of it to do,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.340]   should be done on a typewriter.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.980]   I do not mean poking at the machine with two fingers,
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.340]   but full-fledged touch system
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.480]   capable of turning out 3,000 words an hour.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.960]   This talent will be enormously useful.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.380]   Spread widely enough,
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.220]   it might even revive the lost art of letter writing
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.300]   and undo some of the harm, the laziness,
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.760]   the mental as well as verbal sloppiness
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.540]   induced by the appalling habit
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.280]   of dictating to a stenographer.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.440]   He should play one outdoor game well
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.300]   and have a workable smattering of several more.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.740]   To my eye, an American who cannot throw
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.900]   and catch a ball seems pathetic and grotesque.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.760]   Perhaps I am prejudiced.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.080]   And baseball, except for boys
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.480]   and a small band of professionals,
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.660]   is a lost cause.
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.260]   The usual American game is golf.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.140]   So let him learn, for the sake of human contact
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.520]   and outdoor recreation,
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.400]   to go around the course in at most 110.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.540]   If it were a question of my own son,
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.720]   I should try to steer him toward tennis,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   a livelier game and prettier to watch,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.660]   and one with more possibilities of mental release than golf,
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.400]   which often undoes,
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.760]   in discouragement, obsession, and emotional strain,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.500]   the good it does as exercise.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.880]   A game should not be an end in itself,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.120]   as is often true of golf,
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.240]   but a relaxation and a complete contrast to the sedentary.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.540]   There is something a little sedentary about golf.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.520]   The bicycle is gone,
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.580]   yet every boy should know how to ride one.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.760]   Don't ask me why.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.740]   He should also be able to skate,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.260]   sail a boat, and handle a canoe, passably.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.320]   Skiing is a specialty like chess.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.960]   Those who have it in them
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.940]   will eventually find themselves doing it.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.460]   Those who do not feel the call need not bother.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.860]   It is a singular commentary on college athletics
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.840]   to realize how few sports a man can get along with
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.400]   quite happily after graduation.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.320]   How quickly the vast array of football, soccer,
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.720]   pole vaulting, basketball, water polo, lacrosse,
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.300]   hurdling, handball, rowing, wrestling, fencing,
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.340]   shrinks in after life.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.080]   To,
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.180]   golf or tennis,
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.700]   or surprisingly often to occasional sweat
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.080]   in a steam cabinet.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.820]   Walking is a noble but neglected sport.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.000]   Americans hike once in a long while,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.380]   but seldom walk.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.980]   And biking easily becomes hitchhiking.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.700]   The automobile,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.420]   organized athletics,
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.460]   and the fact that American cities
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.660]   and American suburbs are dismal places to walk in
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.200]   have caused American feet to abandon the roads.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.280]   For every,
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.840]   every climber in an American national park,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.540]   some of which are quite as beautiful as any Alps,
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.560]   there are 10 hikers,
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.920]   50 who pack on horses,
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.300]   and 10,000 who survey the wonders of nature
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.920]   from the windows of a sedan.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.060]   Walking in this country is a lost cause,
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.280]   yet walking is one of the habits
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.920]   I should wish my son to acquire.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.840]   No other exercise,
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.300]   if indulged in several days at a time
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.400]   in pleasant, moderately wild country,
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.200]   has greater power to,
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   to remake a man,
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.220]   to iron out his creases,
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.400]   to produce deep health and spiritual calm.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.460]   The first steps in this elementary course
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.820]   had best be taken in Europe,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.800]   where the natives do not look upon people
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.560]   with heavy shoes and knapsacks
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.020]   as slightly cracked.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.980]   Everyone should know a great deal about animals.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.240]   It is natural for boys to collect stray dogs,
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.620]   and all children seem instinctively
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.060]   to be much more interested
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.580]   in every other branch of the animal kingdom
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.480]   than their own.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.560]   It is equally natural for the city
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.120]   and suburban boy to grow up
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.840]   with no more contact with animals
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.740]   than Mickey Mouse
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.040]   and an occasional trip to the zoo.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.240]   Kindness to animals
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.580]   and an understanding of them
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.880]   has become in modern life
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.520]   a skill that must be nourished
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.560]   and artificially trained.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.800]   I do not expect my son
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.900]   to become a Raymond Ditmars
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.120]   or a William Beebe,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.100]   but I shall think him lacking
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.160]   unless he has much to do with animals
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.480]   and gets on well with them.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.000]   Civilization,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.520]   has hustled us all horribly fast
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.820]   and horribly far away
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.060]   from our primitive state,
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.360]   from the time,
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.380]   biologically not very long ago,
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.760]   when man's life depended a great deal
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.820]   on animals.
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.220]   A certain return to nature
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.140]   is healthy and desirable.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.600]   The best animal for the purpose of this
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.080]   return to nature is the horse.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.620]   I insist, then,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.880]   that a boy should have many horses in his life
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.380]   and should learn how to stay in a saddle
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.540]   with pleasure to himself
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.340]   and a minimum of annoyance to his mount.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.020]   Riding is one of the required studies
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.820]   in my curriculum,
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.560]   valuable both as one of the possible victories
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.900]   over physical timidity
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.120]   and as a source of pleasure.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.560]   With riding should go some knowledge
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.940]   of how to take care of a horse,
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.160]   but I should not like my son
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.720]   to become horsey.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.540]   Horsey people are victims
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.640]   of an obsession even worse than golf.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.180]   They lead mentally four-footed lives
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.460]   and the spiritual aroma
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.760]   of the noblest of beasts
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.020]   clings to them as the smell of
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.640]   straw and manure clings to the stables.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.020]   It is a clean, time-honored smell,
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.720]   but a bit too pervasive.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.780]   I have three fears for the future of my son,
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.360]   that he will join the army,
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.800]   enter the church,
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.580]   or become horsey.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.020]   Trivial but important
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.760]   because one can be so uncomfortable
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.060]   if one does not know them
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.180]   are the parlor amenities.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.480]   A boy should learn how to dance.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.080]   Good dancers, like aviators,
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.000]   are born.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.400]   But anyone can learn to do
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.280]   modern real estate dancing,
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.480]   that form of rhythmically
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.540]   bumping into other people
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.660]   in a small space
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.020]   with a technique dictated
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.240]   by the high land value
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.400]   of the places where dancing
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.740]   is usually to be found.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.160]   The kind of dancing that is really fun
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.940]   is extinct in America.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.620]   Social dancing is no great art,
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.480]   but essential if one wishes
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.660]   between the ages of 16 and 22
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.840]   to become acquainted with
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.900]   more than a few specimens
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.100]   of the opposite sex.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.980]   As to carding,
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.920]   I play bridge so badly myself
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.860]   that I am prejudiced against it.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.460]   If one plays bridge
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.580]   well enough to enjoy it,
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.600]   one probably plays too much of it
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.320]   to the exclusion of better things.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.360]   As a refuge from boring conversation,
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.840]   it is without equal.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.360]   Backgammon,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.520]   though useful for the same purpose,
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.460]   is a monotonous blind alley.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.660]   Pool and billiards are specialties.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.780]   From these indoor pastimes,
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.740]   our student can pick
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.960]   one optional element
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.800]   to the elementary course,
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.940]   which will be given
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.280]   at the pleasure of the instructor.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.720]   Even more trivial,
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.740]   but infuriating if one is clumsy at it,
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.660]   tipping.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.720]   It would be very pleasant
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   to go through life
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.300]   with a knowledge of how to tip
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.040]   naturally, justly,
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.780]   without fear and without reproach.
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.940]   American social habits
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.720]   being what they are,
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.420]   there is one indoor skill
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.540]   which seems to me
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.980]   not only far more important
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.200]   than bridge or dancing,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.980]   but actually compulsory.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.160]   Drinking.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.660]   A young man who could convince me
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.060]   that his lips really would
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.960]   never touch liquor
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.240]   might be let off
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.020]   my required course in drinking.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.740]   But he would be an exceedingly rare bird,
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.580]   and alcohol is so much more evident
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.860]   to liquid in the United States
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.520]   than water,
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.540]   that it is probably quite as necessary
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.620]   for a young man to learn how to drink
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.020]   as it is for him to learn how to swim.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.960]   If the youth of the country
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.640]   had been taught how to drink,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.660]   just as they were taught
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.140]   not to eat between meals
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.520]   or swallow before they had chewed,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.840]   we should never have had prohibition.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.020]   It is a more difficult art than most,
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.520]   for every man reacts differently,
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.440]   and every man should know
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.880]   long before the time
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.440]   when, according to our customs,
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.960]   he indulges in his first collegiate binge,
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.580]   whether liquor goes to his head,
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.760]   his legs,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.460]   or his morals,
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.540]   whether he is the type that sings,
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.220]   fights, weeps,
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.960]   climbs lamp posts,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.380]   or pinches the girls.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.220]   Furthermore, he should learn
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.960]   his capacity,
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.740]   and stick within its limits.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.080]   He should know something
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.520]   about the different kinds of drink,
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.600]   and which drinks produce chaos
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.000]   within him when mixed.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.400]   By all means,
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.540]   let him leave drink alone
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.340]   if he wants to.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.880]   But, since nine times out of ten
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.760]   he will drink,
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.580]   let him do so sensibly.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.500]   I have omitted from this list
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.580]   all mention of women,
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.020]   not so much because it is a subject
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.380]   of appalling breadth,
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.660]   leading to endless discussions
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.400]   of chastity, frustration,
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.180]   fulfillment,
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.900]   birth control,
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.540]   curiosity,
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.240]   mate hunger,
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.060]   and other less printable
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.620]   but even more important topics,
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.580]   because, in regard to the other sex,
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.780]   the fairly well-educated
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.360]   seem to be at as great a disadvantage
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.800]   as the rest of mankind.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.460]   What every high school,
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.120]   boarding school,
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.780]   and college graduate should know
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.740]   is no different from what every man
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.040]   should learn in this darkest
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.760]   and most unteachable province
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.820]   of human conduct.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.840]   I shall not be the one
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.280]   to tell students of this course
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.380]   what acquired skills
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.880]   can prevent mistakes and heartache,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.140]   where sex is considered
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:24.180]   to be a natural phenomenon.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.180]   I shall not be the one
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.180]   to tell students of this course
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.180]   what acquired skills can prevent mistakes
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.260]   and heartache,
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:24.300]   where sex is considered
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.340]   to be a natural phenomenon.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:24.380]   I shall not be the one
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.440]   to tell students of this course
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:24.480]   what acquired skills can prevent mistakes
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:24.500]   and heartache,
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:24.600]   where sex is considered
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:24.620]   to be a natural phenomenon.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.360]   nature clearly intended us
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.640]   to make many mistakes
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.340]   in her hope that some of them
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.200]   would be productive.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.560]   I shall certainly be
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.100]   in a minority
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.720]   in suggesting that our sons
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.240]   should know the rudiments
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.080]   of gambling.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.260]   Gambling might be placed
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.180]   on the same plane as drink.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.300]   The less use one has for it,
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.660]   the better.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.280]   And the sooner America
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.240]   gives up gambling,
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.920]   not only at card tables,
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.780]   roulette wheels,
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.920]   and slot machines,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.820]   but in stocks and bonds
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.960]   of equally mysterious
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.460]   and unpredictable corporations,
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.880]   the better also.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.080]   But gambling in one form or another
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.660]   seems to be a national habit of mind.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.380]   Almost every American
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.280]   gambles at some time in his life,
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.160]   and there are things valuable
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.460]   in other departments of life
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.020]   which gambling can teach.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.700]   To be a good sport,
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.060]   to be a good winner
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.220]   as well as a good loser,
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.540]   especially when games
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.260]   are played for money.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.980]   Not to brood over the irrevocable,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   not to give way
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.900]   to retroactive daydreams
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.320]   and say,
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.560]   if only I had put a big stack
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.400]   on double zero,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.460]   if only I had sold out
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.260]   in August 1929.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.400]   October of that year
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.420]   was the rout
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.060]   of the amateur gambler,
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.460]   and the crash revealed
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.860]   this country to be singularly full
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.080]   of poor losers.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.060]   Important as it is
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.400]   to be a good loser in public,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.200]   it is even more important
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.220]   to learn not to try
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.960]   to turn the hands of the clock backward
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.820]   in the privacy of one's own soul.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.340]   Higher than almost
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.160]   any other accomplishment
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.140]   on the list do I place music.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.160]   There is no reason why
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.260]   any boy who is not
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.500]   absolutely tone deaf
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.620]   should not learn how to play
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.480]   one musical instrument well enough
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.400]   for it to be a self-resource
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.660]   and a tolerable pleasure to others.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.660]   If it were not for the certainty
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.260]   that our educators would make it
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.660]   as deadly during school
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.740]   and as shunned in afterlife
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.080]   as that badly embalmed language,
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.320]   I should advocate
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.760]   the substitution of music
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.460]   for Latin,
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.760]   as a required subject.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.260]   Music is,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.220]   or ought to be,
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.040]   an essential part
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.060]   of every civilized human being's life.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.720]   Economic necessity,
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.760]   the radio,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.780]   and the phonograph
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.600]   have put the playing of music
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.880]   beyond most Americans.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.360]   Our children should bring this back.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.380]   My choice would be the piano.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.500]   The violin is far more painful
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.180]   in incompetent hands,
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.720]   and most other instruments
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.640]   are not meant to be heard singly.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.780]   The saxophone and the ukulele
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.860]   should be placed on par
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.000]   with the taking of drugs.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.900]   There is much to be said
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.980]   for being able to sing parts decently,
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.320]   and any amateur
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.440]   who knows the words
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.060]   of even the commonest songs
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.020]   is a phenomenon.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.040]   I realize that even this
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.280]   is asking a great deal.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.120]   Perhaps I expect too much.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.740]   My students will receive
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.600]   a passing grade
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.420]   if they can sit
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.640]   and listen to good music intelligently,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.420]   and moderately often
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.200]   without pressure.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.160]   A civilized man
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.160]   should know how to read.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.960]   The ability to read,
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.080]   or rather the habit of reading,
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.720]   is very rare,
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.400]   even among intelligent people,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.220]   and has to be taught and kept up
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.620]   if it is not to become rusty.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.340]   The educators tumble over one another
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.140]   with new methods of teaching children
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.540]   how to make sense out of print.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.620]   But not a single pedagogue,
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.560]   so far as I know,
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.000]   has successfully tackled the problem
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.180]   of how to keep people reading books
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.320]   once they have learned
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.340]   that it can be done.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.540]   Incidentally,
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.220]   if someone were to write a little book
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.080]   called How to Read the Newspapers,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.940]   he would earn the undying gratitude
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.600]   of those who search hurriedly
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.420]   for the sports,
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.380]   the market,
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.480]   the obituaries,
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.460]   glance at the headlines,
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.680]   and then throw all the newspaper
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.240]   on the floor.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.920]   If the young man
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.020]   over whose head
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.740]   hangs this list of accomplishments
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.080]   could not find time
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.480]   because of the necessity
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.000]   of healing for the news
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.100]   or keeping dates with co-eds,
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.900]   for more than a few of these skills,
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.380]   let a fluent reading
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.600]   and speaking knowledge
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.160]   of at least one foreign language
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:13.940]   be among them,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.320]   French or German,
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.420]   preferably both.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.000]   A parent must expect
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.120]   no help from schools
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.480]   in the teaching of foreign languages
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.660]   or a round-up
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:21.900]   rather,
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.200]   such is the impression
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.700]   of the student
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.040]   who goes to the average school,
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.740]   in the teaching of irregular verbs.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.940]   Governesses and tutors,
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.280]   little trips abroad
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.600]   in adolescent summers,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.460]   can start a false spring
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.120]   which withers and dies
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.060]   as soon as the child
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.360]   goes to a regular school.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.460]   Everyone learns one language
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.460]   as he learns to walk.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.740]   The learning of more
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.200]   ought not to be so hopeless,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.700]   but hopeless it is for Americans.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.800]   Parents should form
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.860]   a foreign language study association
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.620]   and divide the language
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:51.920]   into two parts.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:51.960]   The first part
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.120]   is to learn
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:52.380]   how to use
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.040]   and combat
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.860]   the schools.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.340]   German children
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.680]   learn an amazingly good
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.380]   brand of English
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.260]   without ever crossing
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.900]   their borders.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.160]   Why can't we?
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.720]   For one thing,
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.660]   we don't really want to,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.920]   yet we should.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.660]   An American who knows
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.280]   only English
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.780]   is blind in one eye.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.740]   Corollary to this
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.400]   are the skills
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.920]   and experiences
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.060]   that come from travel
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.540]   and the tolerances
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.700]   and curiosities
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.880]   about other sorts of people
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.360]   that only travel can produce.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.960]   To travel well,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.600]   efficiently,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.660]   without fuss or complaint,
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.660]   without asking why porters
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.580]   are so stupid
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.220]   or blaming the Italians
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.640]   for speaking their own language
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.280]   is no small accomplishment.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.100]   But what I have in mind
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.620]   is a wider mental habit,
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.160]   an ability to think
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.460]   as a citizen of the world,
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.580]   to meet foreigners
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.720]   upon their own terms,
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.420]   to circulate freely
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.780]   and receptively in London
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.820]   without giving in
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.940]   to that curious
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.600]   chameleon temptation
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.760]   to be, at the same time,
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.460]   a little ashamed
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.480]   of one's own country
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.320]   and to imitate the British.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.620]   The British have it over us
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.800]   in two particulars.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.540]   Their educated men
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.700]   talk well in public
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.700]   and handle their own language
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.900]   and speech and writing
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.660]   as if it were
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.900]   a familiar object.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.380]   Our young man
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.020]   should be able
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.120]   to express himself
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.940]   clearly before
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.020]   a crowd of strangers
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.200]   without shyness,
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.900]   muddle,
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.700]   or a pathetic resort to
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.580]   so much has been said
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.580]   and well said
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.660]   or I did not expect
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.500]   to be called on.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.080]   Children somehow
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.920]   get over the terror
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.500]   of saying
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.180]   how do you do?
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.840]   to strangers.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.480]   But the American adult
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.820]   who can get to his feet,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.020]   propose a toast,
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.740]   introduce a stranger,
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.140]   voice a civic protest,
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.360]   heckle a windbag politician,
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.740]   and give utterance
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.500]   to an unembarrassed thought
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.980]   is a museum piece.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.700]   And a man should command
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.780]   the elementary tool
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.760]   of written language
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.920]   and be able to put
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.180]   simple things on paper
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.400]   in clear words.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.200]   For in its essentials,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.220]   writing is not
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.340]   a mysterious art,
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.680]   but a human function
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.000]   as possible to learn
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.280]   as a human being
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.200]   walking or eating.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.400]   On the borderline
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.980]   between skills like these
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.780]   and book learning
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.420]   are all such things
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.640]   as a sound smattering
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.460]   of the theater,
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.280]   painting,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:02.880]   opera,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.620]   a good workable understanding
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.020]   of the structure of business,
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:06.780]   investments,
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.560]   and banks,
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.940]   which in real life
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.100]   are not quite as they seem
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.860]   in the textbooks
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.300]   of economics.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.660]   To these skills
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.420]   and knowledges
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.500]   I would emphatically
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.100]   add certain experiences.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.020]   The educated
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.040]   young American male
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.260]   is a man who is
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.240]   in peril of too much shelter,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.900]   too little danger
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.840]   and privation,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.220]   and would be the richer
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.740]   if he had at some time
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.320]   in his life
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.360]   been without money
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.740]   and gone hungry
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.920]   for several days,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.160]   been lost or shipwrecked,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.220]   been robbed,
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.440]   been in jail,
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.760]   and spent a few months
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.560]   working as a common laborer.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.300]   This last I place
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.140]   high on the list.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.280]   Let every educated man
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.600]   as a necessary part
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.400]   of his education
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.440]   be thrown into
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.600]   the muddy stream
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.900]   of American industry
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.240]   and be a part of
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:51.740]   the world's
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.740]   and see what it is like
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.780]   to swim alone
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.180]   on daily wages.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.980]   The list of
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.680]   extracurricular accomplishments
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.840]   must come to an end
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.200]   or our young friend
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.160]   will not pass
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.680]   his board examinations.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.800]   One more desideratum.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.820]   He should,
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.960]   before reaching 22,
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.080]   have done something
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.320]   because he wanted to,
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.800]   whether other people
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.260]   wanted him to do it or not,
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.520]   sailed a boat
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.740]   on a perilous course,
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.720]   or shipped
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.040]   as a common seaman,
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.840]   or taken a job
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.220]   on a new ship,
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.760]   or motored across
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.320]   the continent,
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.660]   or gone off to Europe
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.280]   on his own,
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.880]   or learned boiler making,
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.760]   anything so long
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.700]   as it was
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.620]   his own idea.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.520]   And how does one
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.720]   make healthy young
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.820]   middle-class Americans
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.660]   want to do something
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.720]   if all they want to do
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.800]   is enjoy themselves?
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.260]   Ah, if I knew that!
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.180]   And into the young man's
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:45.780]   bag of tricks
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.760]   I should certainly
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.960]   insert the accomplishment
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.640]   of not acquiring property
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.200]   unless he had
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:31:21.180]   the right to do so.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:51.160]   He is, of course,
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.500]   a desirable skill
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.700]   for any man to have.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.720]   And, like swimming,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.840]   bridge, or German,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.380]   it must be learned
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.480]   and worked at.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.420]   What a ferocious program,
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.120]   you may say.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.700]   And how in the world is it,
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.040]   or even a quarter of it,
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.160]   to be put into effect,
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.480]   granted a normal
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.020]   male specimen of the race?
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.820]   Only a fraction of it
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.060]   will be acquired in school,
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.920]   we all admit.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.300]   Parents are busy,
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.260]   and except in rare cases,
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.360]   parents are the worst
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.220]   possible teachers
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.160]   of their own children
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.140]   who know them far too well.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.960]   Summer camps
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.080]   can do some of it.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.460]   American schools
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.520]   grant long holidays
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.280]   to their pupils
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.560]   from June to October.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.800]   And the pupils,
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.340]   if left to themselves,
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.760]   use the holidays
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.620]   to wipe out
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.520]   as much education
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.200]   as possible
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.140]   with a useless,
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.140]   unsystematic,
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.460]   healthy,
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.320]   good time.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.460]   For this idle summer,
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.860]   the camps substitute
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.880]   a schedule of outdoor skills.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.800]   And the boy
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.860]   who goes to summer camp
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:47.860]   usually comes back
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.760]   knowing how to swim,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.640]   fish,
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.460]   paddle a canoe,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.120]   toss a flatboard,
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.840]   and not cry too much
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.500]   when hurt.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.020]   The skills taught
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:55.800]   by the summer camp
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.360]   end with outdoor sports.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.780]   Yet parents are dimly aware
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.160]   of how little school teachers
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.860]   really teach
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.160]   and cling to
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.480]   supplementary education
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.840]   like that of the summer camps
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.780]   when they can get it.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.100]   Why not enlarge the camps
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.900]   and to their outdoor curriculum
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.580]   add German,
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.000]   taught as thoroughly
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.180]   as they teach canoeing?
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.900]   Why not, in fact,
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.160]   apply the basic principle
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.080]   of Americanism
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.140]   and have two systems
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:19.900]   of education
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.100]   competing against each other
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.920]   on one side,
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.580]   the formal schools
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.900]   pouring contents
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.540]   into rebellious minds.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.780]   On the other,
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.660]   summer camps
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.500]   where the children
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.600]   are taught definite
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.860]   human skills,
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.880]   some of them
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.700]   much better taught
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.320]   than the schools
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.460]   can ever expect to do.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.940]   Who knows?
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.340]   In course of time,
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:39.940]   the competition
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.960]   might be too severe
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.600]   and the schools
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.900]   might go into receivership.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.240]   Ah, I thought so.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.920]   There is one skill
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.780]   I had forgotten.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.720]   When, as the result
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.880]   of some trips to Europe,
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.480]   of much prodding
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.200]   on my part,
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.100]   and of summers spent
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.620]   at the kind of summer camp
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.000]   that does not yet exist,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.500]   I am eventually confronted
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.460]   with a son
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.120]   who can make onion soup
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.980]   like Savara,
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.100]   ride a horse like an Indian,
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.680]   play a difficult sonata,
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.200]   speak French and German
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:09.760]   like a native,
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.140]   and repair a leak in the roof.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.600]   Will not there be
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.200]   something missing?
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.820]   Yes,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.420]   an accomplishment
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.620]   vitally necessary
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.540]   to an American.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.060]   Unusual, though,
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.700]   this young man may be,
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.760]   he should not seem so.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.020]   For his own comfort
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.440]   and for mine.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.560]   Is not a parent's
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.480]   basic ambition
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.340]   for his child
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.000]   that he be
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.260]   very different
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.140]   from other people,
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.460]   yet manage to seem
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.980]   almost exactly like them?
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.460]   This article titled
