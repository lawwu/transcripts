[00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.580]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.060]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.580]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.740]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.240]   I'm your host.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today I want to talk to you about the importance of farsightedness and about the importance
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:28.040]   of your not following any kind of crowd when it comes to a special focus, meaning today
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.960]   on preparation, preparation for bad things and catastrophes to happen, and also with
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980]   a focus on long-term wins, especially in the world of investing.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.340]   I believe that the mindset that leads someone to be perhaps the world's most successful
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.920]   investor is the same mindset that leads someone to be very well prepared.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.480]   And these things should go together, although unfortunately they often don't go together.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.000]   I find that people often veer in terms...
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.020]   One direction or another.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.200]   Some people are very preparation-oriented.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.960]   They go through the world believing that everything is falling apart.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.500]   The whole world is filled with catastrophe and chaos.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.380]   Everything is going to hell, and there ain't no getting out of this.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.200]   There ain't no voting your way out of this one.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.700]   There ain't no getting out of this one alive.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.240]   And so because they see the world in that way, they often don't take any action to invest
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.860]   into something that could grow and could become better.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.860]   They'll stockpile a bunker full.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.260]   They'll stockpile a bunker full of beans, bullets, and band-aids and not invest in a
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.900]   mutual fund.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.940]   And thus, they arrive at the end of their lives, in many cases, or the middle of their
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.700]   lives, and they got a bunker full of moldy beans and out-of-date band-aids and some bullets
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.780]   that still work fine.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.780]   And that's usually the best investment they made because it holds its value and holds
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.300]   its usefulness if properly stored.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.880]   But they wind up with no money.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.800]   On the other hand, there are many people who are filled with optimism, looking around the
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.920]   world and saying, hey, things are going to be okay.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.620]   Things can go great.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.180]   Everything's going to be perfect.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.540]   Everything is going to be wonderful.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.080]   And they are prone to investing into something, and they're believers in the future.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.960]   And they say, look, this town could be fantastic, or this company could really grow, and this
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.380]   technology could be wonderful.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.640]   And they spend all their time thinking about what could go well and what could go right,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.680]   that they never stop to think about what could go wrong.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.600]   And then catastrophe strikes, and maybe they have money or maybe they don't, but for lack
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.640]   of ability to run a couple blocks away, they fall prey to a mugging or a knifing on the
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.960]   street.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:41.740]   For lack of a tourniquet, a wound that could be fixed unfortunately causes someone to bleed
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.060]   out.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.740]   For lack of some food and water, their family gets sick or goes hungry in a time of shortage.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.400]   Or for lack of a second passport, they get stuck in a country where they get conscripted
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.620]   into military service and die in some worthless war, something like that.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.460]   So I've noticed this a lot over the years, and I've noticed it as I've had to tackle
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.700]   my own tendencies.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.200]   When I was younger, I was much more on the pessimistic side.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.180]   I don't know why.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.820]   My parents weren't pessimistic or anything like that.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.280]   I guess just the books I ran into.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.620]   And I always was struck by people who said, the dollar's going to collapse, and all this
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.640]   bad stuff's going to happen.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.940]   And that made a lot of sense to me.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.560]   And so I was prone to pessimism and to preparedness, et cetera.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.760]   I wasn't prone to extreme.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.380]   I was prone to optimism.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.340]   Over the years, I've recognized that, wait a second, optimism is probably the best overall
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.960]   strategy.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.700]   It needs to be carefully filtered.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.800]   It doesn't need to be naive optimism.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.780]   But on the whole, human beings have a certain way that they work, and things can get better,
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.840]   broadly speaking.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.460]   I believe they will get better, broadly speaking, in many areas.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.620]   But that just hardcore, unthrottled optimism is also not a good thing.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.000]   How do you handle this?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.860]   One of the things that I'm sharing with you in today's show is how I have learned to handle it.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.200]   I have realized that the skills of great preparedness and the skills of great investing
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.680]   should draw from the same fount.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.960]   They should not be seen as fundamentally at odds with each other.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.000]   And I think that more than that,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.340]   in fact, they buttress each other.
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.760]   They make one stronger.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.140]   Somebody who is well-prepared can and should be, is prepared to be a better investor.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.960]   And somebody who is a better investor is somebody who should be prepared to be better prepared.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.660]   Because we know that we don't win a lot of times.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.380]   A lot of times, investments don't work out.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.260]   A lot of times, bad things don't happen.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.680]   But we still want to focus on the investments that can and should work out, and we want to
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.320]   focus on the bad things that can and should happen.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.680]   As I see it, the psychology that you and I should adapt, the rational, thoughtful approach
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.080]   is exactly the same.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.960]   And here it is.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.300]   We need to recognize that there are times in which certain actions and behaviors are easier.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.840]   So let's start with preparedness.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.640]   The best and easiest time to prepare for a catastrophe is when there is a situation where
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.580]   there is no catastrophe, nay, not even a sign of catastrophe.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.020]   That is the best time to prepare.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.100]   The best time to prepare is when things are rosy and wonderful.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.780]   Because then, preparation is easy.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:51.040]   The very best time to buy life insurance is when you're about 15 days old.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.880]   You've never been to a doctor.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.700]   You've never had any kind of health condition.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.440]   You're not overweight.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.500]   You don't have diabetes.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.800]   You're not maimed or mangled in any way.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.020]   That's the best time to buy life insurance.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.840]   Long before you ever need it.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.160]   And if you buy life insurance long before you ever need it, everything goes great.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.520]   The best time to buy car insurance is when you've never had an accident.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.420]   Don't think you're going to have an accident.
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.160]   Everything is working great.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.340]   That's the best time to buy car insurance.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.560]   The best time to buy extra food is when you're about 15 days old.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.360]   The best time to buy water purification tablets is when you have plenty of money.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.640]   Food is widely available.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.600]   There are no shortages, nor is there even any indication that shortages would ever happen in the future.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.860]   It's so easy to buy extra food and stock up in that circumstance.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:50.460]   The best time to buy water purification tablets is when you're in the middle of a city
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.040]   and there's no reason to buy water purification tablets.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.800]   Then they're everywhere and they're cheap.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.620]   The best time to buy a gun?
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.320]   Long before you ever need one.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.500]   Any preparation topic you talk about.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.320]   Best time to build a house that is earthquake-proof is 30 years before the earthquake comes.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:19.200]   Best time to look at a map of flood plains and figure out whether it's safe to build a house
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.680]   in this particular place or not is long before the floods ever come.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.680]   And that's probably a decent...
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.780]   example for me to pause on because it's something that we can predict
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.860]   and yet something that is exceedingly rare.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.220]   In Florida, where I grew up probably a decade or so ago, maybe more,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.060]   we had a series of 100-year floods.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:52.240]   And in this 100-year floods, my house was okay, but I had a relative's house that was not okay.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.860]   And there was flood water lapping at the door.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:07.360]   Thankfully, it stopped right at the end because one of my relative's neighbors knew where the ditch was,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.780]   or basically knew where the flood outlets were for the neighborhood,
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.080]   had a piece of heavy equipment and went and dug up the road
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   and literally just dug an enormous channel across the road,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.140]   putting in an impromptu ditch to drain the neighborhood.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.600]   And that saved my relative's house right at the last instant when there was...
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.140]   a couple of centimeters from the flood water coming in and wrecking the wooden floor.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.760]   And I've always thought about that example because here,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.640]   this was quite literally called a 100-year flood.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.680]   And what does a 100-year flood mean?
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.760]   Well, it means two things.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.500]   It means that generally this is a flood that we should only expect,
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.980]   you know, about once every 100 years or so.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.900]   So it would be very unusual to have a flood of this height or magnitude one year
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.560]   and then four years later have a flood of this height or magnitude.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.040]   However, it also means the opposite.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.140]   It means that we should expect one of these floods about every 100 years or so,
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.260]   which means that if we haven't had one in a while,
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.380]   we ought to expect one and we ought to plan for one.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.380]   A 100-year flood means that this area is known to flood
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.880]   probably about once every 100 years.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.740]   But with the way statistics work, we have no idea if that means one year
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.320]   and then the next year there's another flood,
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.720]   and then 20 years later there's another flood,
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.520]   and then there's 150 years of no flood.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.580]   So if we have a flood of this height or magnitude one year or magnitude two,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.980]   we have no idea.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.260]   We just know that this is an uncommon event,
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.980]   but we can't predict with any certainty when it will come.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.660]   And so you can look at something like that and you can say,
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.200]   well, this is an infrequent event,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.480]   so therefore it's not worth preparing for.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.880]   Or you can look at it and say,
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.920]   this event is almost certainly guaranteed,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.080]   so it's worth preparing for.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   And I think the rational perspective is to do the second of those options.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.740]   To look at the event and say,
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.520]   okay, we have 100-year flood level in this area of this watermark, this height.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.240]   So what could I do to be prepared in case of a 100-year flood?
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.660]   Now, based upon the severity of the event,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.580]   you and I might make different decisions.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.480]   One man might say, this is a really great house.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.380]   It's a lovely neighborhood.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.160]   I'm worried a little bit about the 100-year flood,
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.800]   but it's pretty infrequent.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.080]   So what I'm just going to do is I'm just going to buy homeowner's insurance
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.200]   and I'm going to hope that nothing happens.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.440]   I'm going to hope that nothing happens.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.260]   If homeowner's insurance is available or,
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.640]   hey, if my house is destroyed, my house is destroyed.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.700]   That's an acceptable risk for living in this particular neighborhood
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.600]   that I want to live in.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.340]   Another person might look at it and say,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.500]   you know what?
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.980]   I'm going to go ahead and make sure that I have a berm system,
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.060]   some kind of sandbags or better yet,
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.840]   some kind of watertight barrier that I could erect around my house.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.020]   I'm going to make sure or at least block off the doorways.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.360]   I'm going to make sure that I have a pump
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.500]   and I'm going to go ahead and raise my house up a little bit higher
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.040]   than is required by code because I know that, you know,
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.840]   a few extra inches on my pad or on my foundation
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.240]   could help to protect this house.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.800]   And the sky's the limit in terms of preparations
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   that could be made from there.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.200]   But when we know that an area has a 100-year flood line in it,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.900]   we know both of those facts with relative certainty.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.660]   We know that floods are infrequent,
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.660]   but we know that floods are...
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.900]   Floods are fairly certain.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.560]   And the time to prepare for those floods
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.240]   is long before the rains start falling
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.280]   because floods come on you very, very quickly.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.420]   And it's the same with all kinds of preparations.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.960]   If you look at events,
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.220]   and obviously I'm stimulated to do this show
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.820]   different than my normal show that I had planned
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.520]   after watching the events in Israel this last weekend.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.280]   One of the things that I myself try to do
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.400]   is to redeem a tragic event to some degree
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.660]   by learning from it at the very least.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.740]   I often find myself frustrated
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.660]   when hearing bad news from around the world
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.040]   of my inability to do much,
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.120]   inability to really do anything to help.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.040]   I stop and my family and I,
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.740]   we pray for the people involved.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.820]   I pray that God would render help and aid and wisdom, etc.
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.800]   And sometimes that feels like something,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.860]   but a lot of times it just feels frustrating
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.200]   because like,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.840]   I can't do anything.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.520]   I'd like to do something more than just pray.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.060]   And yet there's nothing to do.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.780]   I don't, I may not have any connection with somebody.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.180]   I may not have anybody that I can help.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.920]   I may not be able to jump in my car
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.120]   and go fix a situation.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.220]   But one of the things that I have tried to do
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.740]   is to learn from a situation
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.440]   and by putting myself into the shoes
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.460]   of those who were involved in the tragedy.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.200]   So when something bad happens,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.720]   I think, let me assume that that happens to me.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.060]   Let me assume that that happened to me today.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.520]   What would happen?
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.660]   What would I need to do?
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.520]   What would I do in that situation?
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.820]   And I'm not engaging in superhuman,
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.880]   you know, activities in some way.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.680]   I'm not a superhero.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.880]   I'm, in some cases,
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.460]   I'm just going to be lined up
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.700]   and get shot with everyone else.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.820]   I mean, that's just life.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.180]   We don't always get to be the kind of hero
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.360]   they write stories about.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.800]   So then I say, okay,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.000]   if I'm lined up to get shot with everyone else,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.880]   did I do everything I could to get shot?
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.600]   Meaning that did I do everything
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.240]   that that event would be the best possible?
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.160]   If my family and I are all shot together
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.760]   and murdered in our house,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.640]   as some families were in the past couple of days,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.220]   then I just ask myself,
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.500]   well, are we prepared for that?
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.460]   Are we prepared with our eternal preparations?
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.780]   Have I lived a life that I'll be proud of?
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.440]   Am I ready to meet my maker
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.120]   and give an account of my actions
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.660]   and the time that I've had here on earth?
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.260]   Am I ready to die with braveness
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.380]   and with valor and with a good testimony?
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.600]   So that's a reasonable form of preparation.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.460]   I also ask, is there something that I could do
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.880]   or could have done to avoid me
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.020]   and my entire family being killed in that circumstance?
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.600]   And obviously there's many things that can often be done
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.100]   and I'll go through them.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.360]   So for example, over the times past,
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.180]   I have talked and thought about physical violence,
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.240]   meaning am I prepared to die?
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.620]   Am I prepared to fight?
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.060]   Do I have the tools of warfare ready
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.120]   to defend my family, et cetera?
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.260]   But as I was watching the events this last weekend,
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.300]   I just asked myself, could I have run?
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.360]   Right now I'm traveling.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.440]   I have no access to, I have no firearms,
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.060]   no knives, none of that.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.440]   I have some, I know how to create some improvised weapons,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.540]   but quite frankly, I was just asking myself,
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.440]   am I ready to run?
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.580]   Because in many such violent situations,
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.440]   your best, absolutely the best thing you can do
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.160]   is just run.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.380]   And it's quite difficult to hit a running target
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.880]   when you're running, but am I a good enough runner?
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.340]   Is my wife a good enough runner?
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.580]   Are my children good enough runners that if I said run,
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.480]   that they wouldn't gas out after 20 yards?
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.340]   Am I a good enough runner?
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.540]   And unfortunately, that was my learning from this one.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.200]   I said, I need to be prepared to run more
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.820]   and I'm going to engage in much more sprinting
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.240]   and get my stamina up because there may come a day
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.940]   in which I'm running for my life.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.000]   I hope not, but that was just the one lesson I took away.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.460]   I always,
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.080]   try to take one lesson away that's practical
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.500]   that I can do and respond to when there is a catastrophe.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.840]   And I believe that that's one way
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.580]   that we can gain some good from bad
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:42.380]   is to ensure that that bad is not as severe
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.100]   the next time it happens with us.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.720]   And so that's what,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.080]   so I was thinking about those events.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.420]   But more broadly,
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.280]   this is the theme that we must come back to
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.420]   is to recognize that the time to prepare
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.860]   is when things are good.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.620]   And that in order for you to do that,
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.180]   you have to rationally make that commitment.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.720]   And you're probably going to get little support,
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.800]   which is why I wanted to talk about this
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.000]   in the context of investing.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.400]   And I fear that,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.700]   I think I said this at the beginning,
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.700]   but I don't like to talk about these things too much,
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.960]   but I feel because this is not the radical preparedness show,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.160]   but I think this is one of the themes
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.800]   that is simply under-disclosed.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.900]   Under-discussed in personal finance
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.200]   and yet is so effective
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.460]   is the importance of this.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.740]   And that's where I see the connections
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.480]   to the psychology of proper investing.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.080]   If you're going to be a world-class investor
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.580]   and you're going to be somebody who makes it big,
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.940]   then a couple of things are required.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.720]   By the way, you can be a great investor
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.440]   just buying some good investments,
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.120]   dollar cost averaging into them over time.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.680]   That's fine.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.200]   But if you're going to be someone who makes it big,
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.240]   you're going to have to see
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.200]   an opportunity that few others see.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.420]   And then you're going to have to bet
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.440]   for that opportunity
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.720]   long before others are willing to make their bets.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.380]   And then you're going to have to sit tight
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.920]   and wait and see if others catch up to you
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.360]   and see what you saw long before.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.840]   That is something that is fundamentally opposed
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   to mass human psychology.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.420]   That's not what most of us do.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.460]   That's not how most of us live.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.920]   And yet that's how skilled investors have to live.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.480]   The flip side of that is
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.720]   if you're going to be well-prepared,
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.820]   you're going to have to see dangers
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.960]   that other people don't see.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.920]   You're going to have to take action
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.400]   to protect yourself against those dangers
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.560]   long before other people are ready to take action.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.400]   And then you're going to have to sit and wait.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.820]   Now, the good thing about this is that
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.720]   the good thing about preparation
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.800]   is I think that preparedness is something
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.240]   that many people will be happy not to need.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.100]   Unlike an investment where you buy
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.420]   and you speculate on something,
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.660]   you purchase a speculation,
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.880]   you're hoping and hoping and hoping that it takes off
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.500]   and eventually you finally just say,
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.700]   yeah, this ain't going anywhere.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.900]   This company's a dud.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.900]   This pharma drug that I was hoping would be a winner,
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.920]   yeah, it doesn't work.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.800]   This cryptocurrency that I thought was going to be a winner,
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.880]   yeah, no future here.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.060]   And that stinks.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.980]   But at least, hey, I'm out the money that I'm out,
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.740]   but it's not going to sink me, hopefully.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.460]   With preparedness, I myself look at it and I say,
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.700]   yeah, I'm glad that I didn't need that.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.180]   Carried that gun around every day for 50 years.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.980]   What a hassle that thing was.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.820]   It was uncomfortable.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.280]   I am glad I never once needed it.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.940]   Or we had all that long-term storage food in the pantry
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.160]   and after 20 years,
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.640]   had to just give it all away.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.980]   Or feed it to the dogs.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.660]   But I'm glad about that.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.200]   So preparedness is nice because you're glad you didn't need it.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.520]   You obviously question.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.920]   You buy an insurance policy.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.980]   But buy a term insurance policy
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.480]   and you get to the end of the 20-year term,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.160]   usually you're pretty happy you had it
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.680]   and you're not that upset about the lost premiums.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.460]   And so that's the psychology.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.480]   You're going to have to do it.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.420]   And so here's what I want you to remember.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.000]   Bad things happen.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.020]   And they happen to people like you.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.760]   And if something bad is going to happen,
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.880]   you will probably prefer to have been prepared for it
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.560]   than to not have been prepared for it.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.800]   So let me talk briefly with some very broad outlines
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.040]   about some of the things that you can do to prepare for bad times
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.140]   and bad things.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.020]   The most effective forms of preparedness
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.180]   simply involve foresightedness
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.140]   and making different decisions.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.440]   So for example,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.260]   I don't want to...
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.780]   Let me not use the...
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.740]   Israel...
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.120]   Let me...
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.040]   I don't...
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.440]   It's...
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.760]   The wounds are too raw
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.820]   and there's too many uncertainties and unknowns
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.780]   and the fog of war
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:06.180]   and the situation between Israel and Hamas
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.740]   and all of that is too complex.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.360]   So I'm going to avoid using any more discussion
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.500]   of that particular situation.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.220]   I'm ignorant on most of the details.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.300]   And so let me just use other examples that I know.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.140]   Broadly speaking,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.840]   I classify most preparedness into two categories.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.480]   Category number one is being prepared
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.900]   to be still in a place
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.540]   and survive a bad thing.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.580]   And category number two,
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.060]   getting out of a place where bad things happen.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.620]   I like to start with category number two
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.400]   because in many cases it is more effective.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.260]   After years of teaching preparedness
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.000]   and doing that purely from what I call
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.700]   a traditional practice,
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.380]   I realized that the majority of bad things
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.420]   can just be avoided.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.640]   If you're worried about food shortages,
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.360]   just go to a place where there's lots of food
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.100]   and it's unlikely to be in short.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.340]   And that's what humans have done throughout history.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.660]   They leave places that are barren and without food
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.160]   and they go to places that are lush
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.440]   and produce lots of food.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.300]   And then their need to store lots and lots of food
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.280]   is diminished.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.220]   If you live in a cold climate,
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.540]   then you became very accustomed to
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:21.680]   eating a lot of food.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.940]   You're storing up for winter.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.220]   But if you move to a warm weather climate,
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.300]   then the fruit grows on the trees year round.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.260]   And so that principle is something
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.040]   that I've applied very broadly.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.280]   Similar things happen with crime, for example.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.920]   All around the world right now,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.680]   I was reading this morning some stories
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.820]   about Stockholm, Sweden
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.240]   and the crime rates in Stockholm
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.020]   and look at the crime rates
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.160]   in so many big cities around the world
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.060]   and places that were once safe and amazing
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:51.660]   and then they're gone.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.660]   And you see the crime start to tick up
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.440]   and it to be more consistent.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.400]   Well, when crime rates in an area
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.320]   where you are living start to increase,
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.540]   there's a good chance
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.920]   that you're going to be involved in that.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.500]   Your car is going to be stolen.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.080]   You're the one who's going to get mugged.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.580]   It's your wife who's going to get knifed.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.260]   This is the stuff that happens.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.860]   And so you ask yourself,
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.100]   how can I avoid this?
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.040]   And so in many cases,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.980]   if you move out of the bad neighborhood
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.320]   and move into the good neighborhood,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.680]   move out of the bad city,
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.880]   move into the safer city,
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.640]   move out of the unsuitable,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.120]   unsafe country and move to the safer country,
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.520]   you can avoid a lot of the problems that exist.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.300]   So anything involved with moving
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.380]   can often be good.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.020]   The problem is that
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.580]   there are many good reasons not to move.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.700]   There are many good reasons not to leave,
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.220]   not to go somewhere.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.000]   And so if you have some of those reasons,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.080]   then you can't rely just on running away
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.440]   as the primary strategy.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.860]   I believe it's a good strategy
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.620]   in many, many circumstances,
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.620]   but it can't be
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.280]   the primary strategy in all circumstances.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.660]   And so that's where you go to being prepared
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.800]   to be in a place and weather the storm.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.540]   And so everything associated with that,
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.200]   you look at the basic human needs,
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.940]   the needs for safety and security.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.360]   You think about the protection of your home,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.080]   theft, protection of your property.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.960]   Unfortunately, I don't want to be too doom and gloom,
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.800]   but friends, we don't live in the world
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.900]   that we once enjoyed.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.940]   And so you call the police
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.080]   because there was a theft.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.040]   Well, great.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.080]   You know, welcome to the line.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.540]   Welcome to the queue,
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.940]   which is hundreds deep,
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.520]   and there's very little that's going to be done.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.440]   Police officers do their best.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.040]   People do their best,
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.240]   but there's just not enough resources.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.500]   Many ways kind of feels like
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.040]   we're living in a Charles Bronson movie
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.160]   in many circumstances.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.380]   And so you've got to be prepared yourself.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.160]   You've got to be the one to secure your home.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.320]   You've got to be the one to secure your home.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:51.440]   You've got to be the one to secure your home.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:51.580]   You've got to be the one to secure your home.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.620]   You've got to be the one to take responsibility
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.560]   for your neighborhood.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.220]   You've got to be the one to prepare your home, etc.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.560]   And so I like to think
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.680]   I'm not going to teach an entire preparedness class here.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.480]   I'm going to keep this very focused on the psychology.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.580]   But the idea is that you recognize
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.000]   the electricity may go out.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.660]   So when the electricity goes out,
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.340]   what do I need?
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.640]   And you make sure you have battery backups
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.760]   for the things that are important.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.560]   You might have a generator and some fuel stored.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.460]   You need whatever it is that's going to work with electricity.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:21.660]   You need whatever it is that's going to work with electricity.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:21.720]   You need whatever it is that's going to work with electricity.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:21.780]   You need whatever it is that's going to work with electricity.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.940]   Physical safety.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.920]   Recognize there are times in which physical safety
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.800]   can't be guaranteed.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.220]   So how do I protect myself
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.920]   when that physical safety is endangered?
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.360]   Family safety.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.420]   What plans do your friends and family have?
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.620]   Do you have communications plans, etc.?
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.620]   There's so much that can be done.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.120]   On the ability to fly and to flee,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.060]   number one is things like transportation.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.360]   Do I have an ability to transport myself out?
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.340]   I try to follow the practice of filling up my car
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:51.540]   whenever I can.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.000]   Whenever it's at half a tank of fuel.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.600]   That's a simple thing you can do.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.040]   Just always fill up your car so at least you have a half tank of fuel.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.140]   That will give you, in most vehicles,
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.500]   about 200 miles of range.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.640]   Car gas tanks are generally designed
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.200]   to be around 400 miles of range.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.620]   So if you have a half tank of fuel, that'll give you 200 miles of range.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.580]   I think most people
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.680]   should store excess fuel for their car
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.840]   so that if there's some kind of disaster coming,
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.860]   they can leave early.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.580]   And so what I like to do
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.140]   when I'm able to is
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.380]   I want to have two full tanks
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.440]   worth of fuel
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.860]   stored for my vehicle.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.960]   So let's say my vehicle has a 20-gallon tank.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.420]   I want to keep 40 gallons of fuel.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.100]   And my theory is,
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.220]   number one, let's assume that I messed up
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.700]   and I found myself with a completely empty tank.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.900]   Well, I can put 20 gallons of fuel
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.980]   into my vehicle
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.560]   and that'll buy me 400 miles of range.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.500]   Then I can carry with me
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.920]   the other 20 gallons of fuel
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.900]   and that gives me another 400 miles of range.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.500]   And so now I've got 800 miles of range.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   And 800 miles of range
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.660]   gets you out of most bad circumstances.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.860]   That can solve a lot of problems.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.560]   Paperwork is coming.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.060]   And by the way, I'm coming with a story
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.520]   to show you how applicable this is.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.340]   It's not Israel.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.920]   So stick with me
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.520]   because you're going to want to hear this story.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.840]   Paperwork is a huge deal.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.180]   And so paperwork involves
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.740]   money, having money
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.860]   to get yourself out of a problem.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.460]   It involves documents, IDs.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.500]   We live in a world in which you can't move.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.280]   You can't really do anything if you don't have ID.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.540]   And so having a passport,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.960]   simplest point of preparation
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.920]   that you can make
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.460]   and that virtually everyone around you
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.660]   can and should make
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.660]   is you must have a current passport,
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.700]   a current valid passport for yourself
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.800]   and for every member of your family.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.460]   Why don't people do it?
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.260]   Well, it's expensive.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.420]   In the United States,
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.300]   passport is I think 160 bucks,
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.520]   180 bucks, something like that.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.020]   Trust me, I know.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.580]   I buy seven of them at a time.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.320]   I understand it's expensive,
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.740]   but it's fundamental.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.840]   You must have proper identification
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.760]   for every member of your family.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.380]   The best identification is a passport.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.660]   And even if you don't leave your country,
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.620]   the ability to leave your country
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.240]   is really, really important.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.420]   So you want to have a current valid passport
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.640]   for every member of your family.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.220]   It's a hassle because they expire every five years.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.980]   You still have to have them.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.560]   It's so important.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.600]   Most situations,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.800]   in most situations,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.140]   you will want to stay at home
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.120]   in your home country.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.760]   I teach an entire course on planning,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.840]   on international planning.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.840]   In most situations,
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.700]   you will want to stay in your home.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.240]   But in the situations
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.160]   in which you won't want to stay at home,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.280]   you want to get out fast.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.460]   And you cannot sit there
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.320]   and be waiting 13 weeks
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.740]   for your country's passport administration
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.120]   to send you a new passport.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.880]   So you need to keep and maintain passports,
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.940]   valid passports.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.100]   If your country offers you
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.260]   some form of identity card,
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.960]   in addition to a pay passport booklet,
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   you should get that.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.420]   The way that my family and I
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.900]   do that is I have passports
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.580]   for me and for my entire family.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.820]   And then I have a passport card
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.100]   from the United States government.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.140]   And the way we do it
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.140]   is that when we're traveling,
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.880]   my wife keeps the passport cards
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.880]   and I keep the passports.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.080]   When we're at home,
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.220]   I keep all the passports
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.200]   and the passport cards
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.180]   in separate locations
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.700]   so that if one of them is damaged,
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.600]   one of them is destroyed, etc.,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.080]   then I can move on pretty quickly.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.480]   And having been one
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.780]   who's had his passport stolen,
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.520]   if you have various forms
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.140]   of alternative identification,
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:21.400]   it makes sense
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.080]   and much simpler
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.000]   to pop into an embassy,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.980]   walk out an hour and a half later
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.880]   with an emergency passport
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.280]   and be on your way.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.060]   And so be prepared
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.200]   with multiple forms
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.540]   of identification if possible.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.200]   There's other things you can do.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.800]   You could have multiple passports
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.640]   from your country,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.120]   multiple passports
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.420]   from your country
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.320]   and other countries.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.600]   You could have multiple countries
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.720]   that you are involved in.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.160]   Having money,
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.400]   documents and identification
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.180]   are the key thing
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.640]   because money can usually be accessed
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.980]   from wherever you want to be.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.380]   And unless you're in a situation
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.260]   in which you literally need
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.560]   to bribe your way out of the country,
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:00.640]   then you generally can get your money digitally
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.420]   just like you normally do.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.360]   But the documents are the things
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.840]   that are very hard to expedite.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.100]   So that should be your primary solution.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:13.600]   I'm just pausing to consider the scope.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.940]   I'm going to pause there.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.180]   I'm not going to go through
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.880]   every stage of preparedness.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.640]   What I will say is
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.560]   I want to tell you the story
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.360]   of how
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.860]   this kind of thinking
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.460]   can be impacted.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.660]   And this is not my story,
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.100]   but it's a story I recently heard.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.740]   I was recently traveling
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.900]   with my family
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.520]   in the country of Luxembourg
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.160]   in Europe,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.020]   near France and Germany.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.800]   And small little country,
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.040]   beautiful, wonderful little country.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.380]   And I was connected with a listener
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.000]   when I was there.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.420]   And my listener shared this story with me.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.260]   This listener has his wife.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.140]   He's from Luxembourg
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.840]   and his wife is from Ukraine.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.380]   And he shared with me the story
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.960]   of how preparedness
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.620]   quite literally saved
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.240]   his family members' lives
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.700]   in the course of the recent,
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.900]   or not recent now,
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.660]   a couple of years ago now,
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.580]   but the invasion of Ukraine
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.420]   by the Russians.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.700]   And I felt,
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.060]   I believe the details of this
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.280]   are illustrative of very,
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.020]   very high quality planning
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.380]   on every level.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.860]   So the first thing is this.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.900]   There were tensions.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.440]   Related to
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.860]   the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.560]   As we all remember,
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.220]   there were indications
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.940]   that some people thought
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.040]   the Russians might invade.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.120]   And everyone was saying officially,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.340]   no, they're not going to invade.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.040]   They might invade.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.220]   No, they're not going to invade,
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:36.880]   et cetera.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.580]   Well, my friend,
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.680]   because of his family's connections to it,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.560]   they were paying attention
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.660]   to those indications.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.840]   And they were talking with family members
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.280]   and formulating a plan.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.060]   They were formulating a plan
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.280]   of what they were going to do
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.900]   and what to do if it did happen.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.160]   And they were watching the situation.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.380]   And so as I understand the story,
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.000]   his wife's,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.940]   there were three basic family members
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.580]   that were most important.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.320]   His wife's parents
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.400]   and his wife's grandmother
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.320]   who were still living in Ukraine.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.360]   They had met in Ukraine.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.780]   She was living in Luxembourg.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.100]   But her family was there in Ukraine.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.780]   And her father had a job, et cetera.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.620]   So what do we do?
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.680]   Well, their indication
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.200]   was when Israel closed
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.220]   its embassy in Ukraine
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.560]   because of the risk concern,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.680]   that was their indication.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.460]   He was in contact
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.500]   with anybody who knew military,
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.660]   anybody who might have
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.140]   contact information.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:33.660]   And they said,
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.320]   we need to take action.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.680]   But they weren't ready
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.200]   to take complete and total action.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.660]   For context,
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.480]   her family lived
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.920]   in the Russian-speaking part of Ukraine,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.600]   very near the border with Russia.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.660]   So they were basically
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.100]   on the front lines of,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.560]   where any particular invasion would happen.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.800]   And so he convinced,
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.720]   they rented a house.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.880]   They didn't try to leave Ukraine completely.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.040]   But what he did was
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.980]   they rented a house
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.060]   on the other side of the mountains.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.360]   If memory is right,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.840]   it was the Carpathian Mountains.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.080]   And so he moved the family
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.300]   away from the border
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.640]   but kept them in Ukraine.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.560]   That way, they would minimize
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.380]   the hassles of international travel.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.380]   What if it's a false alert?
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.120]   What if Russia doesn't
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.920]   invade after all?
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.240]   We don't want to have too many issues.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.940]   And so they did a one-month rental
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.440]   in a vacation town
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.580]   on the other side of Ukraine
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.520]   near the border.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.480]   Forget which border.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.760]   I think Slovenia, Slovakia.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.360]   Near the border with neighboring country.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.320]   And so that they could get out
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.940]   fairly quickly if they needed to.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.120]   But they weren't completely gone
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.980]   right away.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.200]   So then
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.960]   they went there.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.400]   And nothing happened.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.600]   They were there for a couple of weeks
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.260]   just enjoying a resort town,
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.580]   enjoying a tourist destination.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.600]   And then Russia went ahead and invaded.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.580]   And the day Russia invaded,
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.300]   obviously, everything changed.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.840]   And they immediately said,
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.640]   time to take action.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.900]   And so they
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.880]   saved their lives
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.580]   but they didn't go with an all-the-way
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.240]   travel far-away plan.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.900]   Just travel across Ukraine
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.500]   and get away from the border area.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.880]   And they were there for a couple of weeks.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.340]   Their town was impacted.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.300]   The Russians invaded.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.780]   Everything became difficult.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.780]   And they would not have been able to get out
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.060]   of that area,
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.960]   especially not with a 93-year-old grandmother
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.500]   with all the other refugees.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.700]   Now, interestingly then,
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.940]   immediately my friend and his wife
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.840]   loaded up the car.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.260]   They had been preparing for this.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.640]   And they immediately started the very long drive
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.500]   from Luxembourg to go and get them.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.560]   They drove day and night.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.320]   And as he expressed it to me,
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.660]   he was very valuable to know.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.040]   All right, I've got food.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.660]   I've got water.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.540]   I've got a cook stove.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.540]   I've got some sleeping bags.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.340]   We can just go.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.080]   And we can drive across Europe day and night
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.720]   until we get there to get them out.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.520]   When they went to get out,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.300]   the Ukrainian government
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.580]   would not let the father leave
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.720]   because they had immediately passed a law
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.860]   stating that all men of a certain age,
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.060]   basically a fighting age,
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.100]   were denied exit from the country.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.420]   And so they wouldn't let him leave.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.280]   But as it turns out,
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.780]   he was a few weeks away from the border.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.480]   It was a birthday in which
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.160]   he wouldn't have to serve anyway.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.060]   Three weeks away or something like that.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.340]   And so I can't remember if they came back the next day
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.060]   and they were able to get out and leave.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.640]   And they got into the neighboring country
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.040]   where my friend and his wife picked them up,
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.840]   engaged in the long drive back across Europe with them
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.100]   back to Luxembourg,
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.380]   got them to safety.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.080]   And they lived with their family
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.100]   for a significant period of time.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.280]   Obviously that was difficult.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.660]   But by having money and being able to do it,
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.800]   they were able to save lives.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.140]   Eventually worked out the residence permits,
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:50.700]   worked out the residence permits,
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.320]   worked out a job,
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.740]   and the family is able to press on
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.220]   and gain some more independence
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.500]   and some more standing.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.660]   But I thought,
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.760]   what a perfect example of good emergency planning.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.420]   The idea is having stages of
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.300]   if an event starts to threaten,
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.420]   if there's some kind of event that's coming,
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.860]   then I have plan A, stage A.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.240]   And then if it gets worse,
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.200]   I move on to stage B.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.560]   And if it gets worse,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.000]   I go ahead and go all the way to stage C.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.380]   That's something that I think
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:20.620]   is very important.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.920]   It's very under-discussed
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.860]   and under-appreciated in disaster planning.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.080]   A lot of times,
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.520]   the reason people don't leave
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.360]   when they should leave
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.720]   is because the consequences of leaving are too big.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.420]   You don't want to call up your job
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.760]   and say, I'm not coming in today
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.200]   and risk losing your job for a false alarm.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.480]   And so you have to come up with some way of saying,
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.640]   how do I make sure that I'm on the other side
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.340]   of the mountains,
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.960]   hundreds and hundreds of miles away
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.800]   when bad things might happen,
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.000]   and I'm not right on the border region
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.520]   without necessarily destroying everything in my life
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.540]   and walking around the city,
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.860]   walking away from everything.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.100]   But if you're not on the other side of the mountains
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.440]   when the neighboring country invades,
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.320]   you've got a problem.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.560]   And so think about stages in your disaster planning.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.660]   If this, then that.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.780]   If this, then that.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.960]   And think about how I could put in place phases.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.320]   That's why in my course,
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.980]   I've talked a lot about that,
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.200]   about having places that you know you can go,
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.000]   that you know that you want to go.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.880]   So if it just turns out
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.740]   you took an impromptu few-week vacation
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.420]   and then everything calmed down again
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.240]   and you went back home,
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:20.460]   that would be a good thing.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.240]   That was fine as well.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.260]   So think about stages.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.560]   And then also notice how important,
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.180]   it wasn't,
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.880]   there weren't shortages of food and water
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.640]   in that scenario,
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.260]   but notice how important
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.420]   transportation and documentation is.
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.100]   The ability to get your family members out
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.820]   relies on transportation
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.980]   and documentation to get them out legally.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.340]   How do you do that?
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.200]   Where do you go?
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.860]   And then where are you going to go
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:46.920]   if something happens
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.020]   when you're dealing with a national conflict?
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.360]   So I'm going to talk about that.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.400]   I'm going to cut off there
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.280]   and not teach an 18-hour preparedness course here.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.920]   But I want you just to recognize
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.420]   that when you see bad things happening around the world,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.060]   you can improve and redeem those bad things a little bit
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.880]   by thinking about what you would do
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.860]   and making a plan for it.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.880]   And even just the process of thinking it through
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.560]   and listening to someone's stories will improve it.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.500]   I would encourage you, do like I do.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.140]   Pick one thing that you're going to change
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.060]   when you hear of a disaster situation
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.260]   that you can possibly apply to.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.820]   Pick just one thing.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.580]   And in addition to that,
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:30.860]   make a resolution to be the kind of person
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.320]   that takes action because it's logically warranted,
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.640]   not because it's emotionally comfortable.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:43.220]   Recognize preparation is logically warranted.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.480]   Houses burned down, you should have insurance.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.220]   People die of heart attacks,
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.440]   you should work on your health
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.060]   and you should have life insurance.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.900]   Countries close their borders,
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.120]   you should have a passport from another country.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.840]   War breaks out, neighborhoods become unsafe to live in.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.340]   Pay attention to those things and take action.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.800]   But in order to do so, you have to do it long in advance.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.200]   And then recognize,
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.980]   you don't have to be a gloomy, pessimistic person.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.180]   Good things happen, things improve,
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.580]   situations turn around.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.740]   So take bets on the places that are doing well
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.120]   and the things that are going well.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.920]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.680]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.300]   So let me promote two things to you
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.480]   and I hope you'll enjoy these.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.700]   Number one, recognize,
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.900]   I teach an entire course called International Escape Plan,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.460]   internationalscapeplan.com.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.280]   You can go there today, you can buy my course.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.960]   It's a careful step-by-step course
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.000]   on how to be engaged in internationalization
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.580]   in a thoughtful and rational way.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.340]   Probably the best money you'll spend in the international space.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.260]   I'll teach you how to think through
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.040]   getting a passport, a SIM card, a credit card,
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.140]   a credit card that'll work overseas,
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.060]   all the way up to second residencies,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.740]   houses abroad, et cetera,
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.060]   but in a really rational, phased approach.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.640]   The reason I love the story from my friend so much
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.400]   is it was a perfect encapsulation
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.180]   of the phased approach of preparedness planning
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.620]   that I talk a lot about in that show.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.920]   So go to internationalscapeplan.com and buy my course.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.460]   Number two is recognize that I'm doing an event
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.940]   in Panama in January.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.340]   You can go to expatmoney.com slash radical,
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.240]   expatmoney.com slash radical,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.020]   and you can sign up for that.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.840]   You should come just to hang out,
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.620]   stay at a nice hotel, enjoy a beautiful city,
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.780]   enjoy good company with me and with Mikkel Thorup
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.820]   and with Gabriel Custodiat
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.960]   and with other listeners of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.840]   We're going to have a great time.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.920]   There's lots of time scheduled,
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.860]   and I'll be fully and completely available to you
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.320]   during the entire course.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.800]   So we'll get a lot of time together,
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.240]   talk about anything that you want,
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.380]   visit together, et cetera.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.760]   But we'll also have a series of sessions planned.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.940]   All the details are on that website.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.820]   And we're doing,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.700]   basically, an investment tour of Panama,
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.380]   looking at some of the options, opportunities, et cetera.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.920]   Panama is not perfect,
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.760]   but it is one of the better options
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.080]   for several pieces of your flags
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   in an international perspective.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.900]   And so it's a really great option,
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.360]   and we'll be talking about it extensively
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.320]   and getting a chance to see it firsthand in January.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.460]   So sign up for that event.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.960]   Go to expatmoney.com slash radical,
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.920]   expatmoney.com slash radical.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.120]   Would love to see you there.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.080]   Bye.
