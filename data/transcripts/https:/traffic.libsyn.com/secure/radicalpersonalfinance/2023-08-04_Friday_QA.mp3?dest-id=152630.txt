[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.440]   We begin with Mark.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.240]   Mark, welcome to the show.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.100]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.980]   Hi, Josh.
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.940]   We're a long time.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.500]   Listener.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.080]   Appreciate everything you do.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.520]   One of the,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.000]   one of the tricks I've used,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.460]   I guess,
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.320]   or tools I've,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   I've used in the last several years is a,
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.840]   is an old rollover IRA.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.620]   So from a,
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.000]   from a previous employment.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.920]   And so even though now I'm in a,
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.680]   in another 401k and,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.740]   and contributing steadily to that,
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.980]   I've got this old IRA.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.580]   And,
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.420]   and as my kids entered college,
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.480]   in the college years,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.520]   I had three kids that I went through.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   That rollover IRA,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.340]   as I learned,
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.760]   I could,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.400]   I could take money out of that
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.960]   for education expenses,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.320]   penalty free,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.740]   was a pretty important resource for me
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.600]   going,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.200]   going through those years.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.540]   And although I know,
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.020]   we generally,
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.720]   nobody,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.880]   nobody talks much about early withdrawals
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.220]   from those types of accounts.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.060]   As,
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.720]   as my thoughts about retirement
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.200]   and retirement savings have changed much,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.360]   much because of,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.380]   of your thoughts and teaching.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.940]   That's been a very good tool for me to dip into.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.420]   And yet I don't hear much said about that exception
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.380]   for taking a penalty free,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.380]   free withdrawals.
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.900]   And so wanted to just get you to react to that a little bit
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.560]   and get your thoughts on,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.060]   on the appropriateness of that.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.940]   Right.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.460]   Well,
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.420]   I think the reason you don't hear much said about it
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.060]   is simply that in general,
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.520]   nobody wants,
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.160]   I don't know of a financial planner in the world
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.740]   who would advise somebody to take money from an IRA
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.360]   and,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.760]   and use it for educational expenses.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.360]   And there's one simple reason.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.520]   You can easily borrow money for college.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.860]   You can't easily borrow money for retirement.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.780]   So it's not that it can't be done.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.500]   Obviously it is a relevant exception.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.120]   You can take the money out penalty free.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.960]   You can use it,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.300]   but in the priority of different goals
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.360]   and the ease of reaching those goals,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   retirement,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.100]   the vast majority of people are significantly underfunded
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.020]   for retirement.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.060]   Retirement is a very large goal.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.680]   That's impossible to borrow from.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.340]   And so,
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.760]   financial planners don't want people taking money
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.060]   from retirement where it's productive and active
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.700]   and using it to pay for college expenses.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.580]   I myself would,
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.260]   I mean,
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.200]   I guess in theory,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.620]   I would come up,
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.800]   I mean,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.740]   there are certainly situations in which I would say,
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.120]   okay,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.300]   but those situations would be simply,
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.080]   I've got millions and millions of dollars in my 401k.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.500]   I'm well squared away for,
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.600]   for an IRA,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.140]   you know,
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.560]   I'm well squared away for retirement
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.680]   and I just need some extra money for this kid's college
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.820]   and for whatever reason,
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.220]   I'm going through a temporary period of hardship.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.560]   But,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.020]   but taking money from an IRA to pay for education
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.240]   would be the very last thing that I myself would encourage someone to do
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.920]   simply because of the ease of borrowing,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.660]   the ease of paying for college,
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.040]   either through cashflow,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.260]   either on the behalf of the student or the student's parent,
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.660]   or the ease of borrowing for college in a worst case scenario.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.000]   And all of that is preferable to taking money out of a retirement account.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Yep.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.880]   That's,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.960]   you know,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.360]   that's pretty,
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.840]   pretty consistent with what I,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.480]   you know,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.440]   I know is kind of the standard financial plan answer.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.400]   I just,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.160]   I've found it useful not being as worried about retirement funding,
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.620]   but it's,
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.660]   it's been useful for covering certain hardships,
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.620]   I guess,
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.980]   or expenses during those years where I'm not,
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.520]   I'm also,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.680]   they're also in college and we're also spending on tuition.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.100]   Right,
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.300]   right.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.000]   And I think that those,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.100]   your exception may be one of those things.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.880]   As long as your other finances are,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.160]   are well squared away and you're looking at it and saying,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.380]   I have a temporary hardship.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.520]   I'd rather use my own assets instead of,
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.820]   instead of,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.600]   of borrowing for this,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.960]   then I think it can,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.200]   it's not a bad thing,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.420]   but because I don't want to repeat myself unnecessarily.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.420]   So I just say it very simply because,
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.620]   because so many people are so woefully behind on retirement,
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.820]   that's the fundamental reason that generally speaking,
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.440]   we don't use retirement accounts for college,
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.280]   that there are so many other alternatives that are superior,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.660]   that though it is possible to take money penalty free from a retirement
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.620]   account in limited circumstances for higher education,
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.840]   it's generally not advised.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.860]   Anything else?
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.480]   Well,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.760]   one,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.360]   one different question too is about,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.780]   uh,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.240]   about how the savings picture has changed in these last couple of years.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.060]   Uh,
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.780]   a few months ago,
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.300]   I encouraged my dad to,
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.380]   to get with his financial planner and he,
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.660]   he had a good bit of money just,
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.140]   um,
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.560]   kind of parked in cash.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.100]   And,
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.540]   uh,
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.620]   he did that.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.140]   And,
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.580]   um,
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.200]   you know,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.000]   lo and behold,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.140]   the money market fund is just under 5% that he's moved his cash into.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.260]   Uh,
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.960]   the financial planner didn't,
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.180]   didn't bring it up or,
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.660]   this didn't happen automatically.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.800]   Uh,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   and so he's,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.120]   you know,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.360]   he's getting another $1,000 a month,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.260]   uh,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.780]   income off of this.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.080]   And so just as you know,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.240]   the,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.860]   these things have kind of crept up over the last couple of years,
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.520]   interest rates.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.660]   And,
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.120]   um,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.000]   and there it's easy to get 5% now on a CD or just almost that on a money
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.340]   market.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.060]   And so,
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.560]   um,
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.320]   I haven't heard,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   I haven't heard you talk much about that change,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:09.300]   but I wanted to get your thoughts on what that changes for people and,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.700]   uh,
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.560]   how to use,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.500]   you know,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.360]   how to make the most,
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.760]   when,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.860]   when to make the most of,
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.980]   of,
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:15.420]   uh,
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.280]   these kinds of higher interest rates.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.520]   Now,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.060]   I was talking about it on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.340]   And the comment I made then was I never thought in my lifetime that I would,
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.840]   I never thought I would see the original portfolio recommendations from the book by,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.400]   uh,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.100]   Joe Robinson or Joe Robbins and Vicky Dominguez or vice versa.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.600]   I can't remember the names exactly called your money or your life.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.220]   Uh,
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:38.780]   I never saw,
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.280]   thought I would see their portfolio recommendation come back into Vogue,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.580]   but we're living in a world in which their portfolio recommendation,
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.540]   uh,
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.820]   is actually doable once again.
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.480]   And for the uninitiated,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:52.860]   they,
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.340]   they wrote this book back in the,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.080]   I mean,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.740]   what was it?
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.360]   Late seventies,
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.940]   early eighties,
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.560]   something like that.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.740]   And basically they encourage people that as an early retirement plan,
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.660]   you should just simply take all your money and put it into government treasuries.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.580]   And that if the government treasuries interest rate was high enough,
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.700]   then that was good to go.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.620]   And I have been watching this and looking at it and trying to challenge my own thinking and say,
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.560]   do I believe that people should do this?
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.700]   Because if you have enough money,
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.260]   you can put money in treasuries right now,
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.460]   sit back with zero risk and collect a pretty decent income right now,
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.380]   just on your treasuries.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:24.980]   Uh,
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.100]   is it still,
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.280]   do I do?
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.000]   So I've been challenging myself.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.060]   I don't have a lot to say other than that.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.380]   I think for someone with enough money,
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.760]   that's certainly a reasonable scenario.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.960]   And in the meantime,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.240]   all of us should be looking for as much return as we can get.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.740]   And so CD rates are going up,
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.300]   got various savings accounts.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.660]   Rates have been going up and we should take advantage of them.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:44.940]   I don't,
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.620]   there's no downside to doing that.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.640]   So I just don't have much to add beyond that.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.280]   Right.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.340]   Thank you very much.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.700]   Love it,
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:52.840]   Mark.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.460]   We move on.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.640]   Welcome to the great state of Utah.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.420]   Welcome to the show.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.340]   How can I serve you today?
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.680]   Hi Joshua.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.280]   Um,
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.160]   can you hear me?
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:01.340]   Okay.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.820]   Sounds good.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.140]   Go ahead.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.020]   So I have a question for you.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.320]   Um,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.580]   revolving around,
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.240]   um,
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.460]   my wife's grandparents house.
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.440]   Um,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.460]   so a little backstory.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.000]   Um,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.960]   they own a house,
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.440]   um,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.700]   in North Dakota,
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.140]   uh,
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.080]   that my,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.860]   my mother-in-law grew up in.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.220]   Um,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.700]   and then,
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.360]   um,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.780]   my wife's grandparents live in now.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.160]   Um,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.240]   and they're getting to the age,
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.140]   that it's a little bit,
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:26.440]   uh,
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.460]   too much work for them to take care of.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.940]   It's gotten a little bit more expensive.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.560]   Um,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.740]   and they've been talking about moving,
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.560]   um,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.680]   just because age and,
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.120]   and positive living there.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.920]   Um,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.800]   so it kind of came up.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.620]   My wife brought it up that we might,
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.740]   you know,
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.620]   we might consider buying house from her grandparents so we could keep it in
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.560]   the family because they're not selling it because they want to.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.820]   They're selling it because it's just got to be too much work for them.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:54.700]   Um,
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.260]   and so we have just kind of been rolling that around.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.700]   Um,
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.120]   and I was curious if you had any suggestions on how to go about like
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.420]   analyzing that opportunity.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:03.920]   Um,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.360]   anything you would look for.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.740]   Um,
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:12.520]   we've kind of talked about keeping a bank out of it and maybe owner financing
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.480]   it for grandparents.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.760]   I don't know if you have any advice on that or any pitfalls we should avoid.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.160]   Right,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.420]   right.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.060]   Let me make sure that I got the,
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.600]   the chain of facts straight.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.980]   You are considering buying a house.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.440]   You're buying it from your family members.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.300]   Uh,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.360]   and would you live in the house yourself or would it be a rental property?
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.100]   What would you do with the house if you did buy it?
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.860]   So the house is in,
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.200]   um,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.900]   a small town in North Dakota and my wife's in the air force.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.640]   So we don't really have the opportunity to live in it for probably eight more
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.020]   years.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.600]   Um,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.420]   the thought crossed our minds that,
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.440]   um,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.200]   you know,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.780]   grandparents could continue to live in the house.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.220]   Um,
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.560]   and,
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.160]   um,
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.820]   we would provide,
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.740]   you know,
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.460]   the lawn care,
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.480]   the snow removal,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.800]   which would take the burden of maintaining the house away from them.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.720]   And then they wouldn't have to move,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.900]   uh,
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.320]   find a new place,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.100]   buy a new house and deal with that.
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.500]   They could continue to live in the house.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.060]   They built,
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.400]   uh,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.300]   and my in-laws grew up in,
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.320]   but we probably wouldn't be living in the house for a while.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.400]   Okay.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:17.840]   Got it.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.920]   How much is the house worth?
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.200]   Uh,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.660]   just in terms of the open market?
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.040]   Um,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.840]   so none of the houses around it has sold,
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.200]   um,
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.100]   for quite a few years.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.540]   So it's not a great estimate.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.980]   They're a little lifted right now.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.280]   Um,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.600]   the two lots that they own at about $750,000.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.380]   Uh,
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.980]   so we had thrown around the idea of other smaller,
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.480]   you know,
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.840]   uh,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.060]   single family houses in the area are about 200,
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.560]   $250,000.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.340]   So we had thrown around the idea that for grandparents,
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.220]   we're going to buy,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:49.880]   you know,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.480]   sell this house and use part of the profits to,
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.000]   um,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.840]   buy a smaller house.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.760]   We could maybe,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.180]   you know,
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.920]   use the offset,
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.600]   the cost of what they would pay,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.620]   um,

[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:40.020]   And then you're looking at the cost of the house.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:41.020]   And then you're looking at the cost of the house.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.020]   And then you're looking at the cost of the house.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:47.020]   And then buy a house when it's just a steal of a deal and is obviously a great thing,
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:51.020]   versus this being a primary goal that I really need to buy a house right now.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:57.020]   The great thing about mutual funds, retirement accounts, etc., is that most of that wealth is invisible.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:06.020]   And you can get really, really rich really, really efficiently without the external indications of wealth that can go one of two directions.
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:11.020]   Either attract a guy who's a deadbeat who's just attracted to you because he's going to be, you know,
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:12.020]   the deadbeat guy who moves around the world.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.020]   The deadbeat guy who moves around the world.
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:14.020]   Or he just goes, "Hey, I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:15.020]   I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:16.020]   I'm going to buy a house."
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:17.020]   Or he just goes, "Hey, I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.020]   I'm going to buy a house."
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:19.020]   Or he just goes, "Hey, I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:20.020]   I'm going to buy a house."
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.020]   Or he just goes, "Hey, I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.020]   I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.020]   I'm going to buy a house."
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:24.020]   Or he just goes, "Hey, I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:25.020]   I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:26.020]   I'm going to buy a house.
[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:27.020]   I'm going to buy a house."
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:28.020]   And then he says, "Hey, I'm going to buy a house."
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:33.060]   awards, but it's not an absolute rejection of buying a house. Is that gray enough for you?
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:39.260]   That actually, I had not thought of that, slowly building up the retirement accounts and have it
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:44.420]   be hidden. That makes a lot of sense. And as far as I know, I could still access that if I needed
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:48.920]   to before retirement. So I hadn't thought of that, so I appreciate that. Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:56.000]   I said what I wanted to say. So I just think the social environment is really important. One of the
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.720]   great problems that young people tend to do is they tend to live on their own, especially in
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.080]   American culture, where you're just pushed to be on your own and to be independent by the whole
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:13.640]   culture around you. I honestly don't understand why most people would ever want to live alone.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:19.800]   You do want to have your own space. You do want to have enough privacy, et cetera. But I would
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:25.240]   always much rather live with people that love me, people that care for me, people who can see how
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:25.980]   I'm doing every day. I don't want to live with people who are not as good as I am. I don't want
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:26.080]   to live with people who are not as good as I am. I don't want to live with people who are not as good as I am.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:32.240]   Being alone is not good for any man or woman on an ongoing, continual basis. And so if there is a
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:39.960]   living environment where you can rent a room from some friends of yours, it's just much better. And
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:46.700]   you don't need to buy a house to build wealth. The house is appropriate at a different stage of life.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:52.120]   And so I would say there's a lot you can do just in terms of, again, fill up your retirement
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.300]   accounts. If you've filled up all your retirement accounts and you still can save more money,
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:55.960]   just save up your retirement accounts. And if you're not able to save up your retirement accounts,
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:02.180]   save more money. And then in three years from now or five years from now or something like that,
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:09.340]   when you find a great house, a really killer deal, and you have real confidence about it,
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:13.600]   then you'll have plenty of money to buy the house at that point in time. So those are my thoughts.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.820]   I hope it helps. That does. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Thank you. And with that, Jose,
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:25.740]   you have been extremely patient. Thank you. How can I serve you today? Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks,
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:34.800]   Joshua. I've enjoyed the call so far today. I've got a couple of things, but maybe I will
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:43.000]   limit it to one. Try to keep this under two hours. So I have a general philosophy that insurance
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:54.760]   is a bad deal in most cases, unless it's insuring a catastrophic loss. And so, for instance,
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.000]   I sell a home and they say, oh, do you want the protection plan for an extra 10 bucks a month?
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:10.080]   I assume that they're in business to make money. And assuming that I can pay for it,
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:15.380]   if I drop it in the water and destroy it, it's going to cost more in the long run for me to pay
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:21.840]   for that insurance. And so same thing with like a car's extended warranty, that sort of thing.
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:25.900]   And I wanted to hear your thoughts on that.
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:32.360]   Obviously, something like health insurance, when you have a lot of assets that could be
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:38.800]   spent up because you're in the hospital or something, that makes sense because that could
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:44.340]   be a catastrophic loss. But one, I was curious about your thoughts on that general philosophy.
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:52.240]   And then two, where do I draw the line? And part of that is, I do have a property that I
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.880]   don't currently have insured. And it's, if I live in a house, I don't have a property that I don't
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:59.500]   have insured. And if I lost it in a fire, it wouldn't be catastrophic, but it would be a bummer.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:05.960]   On the other hand, the cost to insure that at the moment is relatively high because it's
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:14.360]   an unoccupied property. And so I'm just trying to weigh, like, at what point do I say,
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:20.240]   no, this is worth it to insure it versus, no, it wouldn't be catastrophic if I lost it,
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:24.100]   so let's not waste the money. Right. Right. It's a good question.
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:33.020]   The first thing I would say is, let me see if I can find it real quick. In the very beginning of
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:39.160]   Radical Personal Finance, back in the first 30 episodes or so, I gave you a, I gave a show where
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:49.500]   I gave a complete outline of all of the, of the structure for risk retention. And so the first
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:55.840]   answer to your question is to say that deciding whether, thinking that you only,
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:01.540]   buy insurance or you don't buy insurance, and that's the only way that you cover risk,
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:08.220]   is a false conception. And so actually I found it. It's called, Do I Need Insurance? A Mental
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:14.900]   Model to Analyze Methods of Dealing with Risk. It's episode 91, published on October 29, 2014.
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:20.380]   And so, you know, my introduction, many of us have had exposure to various forms of insurance
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:23.800]   throughout our lives, but how do you make the initial decision whether insurance is appropriate
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:25.820]   for you? Today, I share a framework for you to use to make the initial decision whether insurance
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.320]   is appropriate or not. And so I'm going to share a framework with you for considering various risks
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:32.060]   you face and various ways to deal with those risks. So I'm not going to repeat that entire
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:37.780]   podcast. I have not changed my opinion since that date. And if you, when you listen to that show,
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:45.640]   episode 91 of the show, you will recognize that insurance is perfectly appropriate in some
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:52.840]   situations and is perfectly inappropriate in other situations. And so let's use an example like the
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:03.680]   I don't buy insurance on my cell phones. I haven't in, I can't remember. I mean, I think I,
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:07.860]   excuse me, I can remember that I used to, but I can't remember the last time that I did.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:16.860]   And the reason is very simple. For me, the loss of a cell phone and needing to go and purchase
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:22.140]   another cell phone, even the kinds of premium thousand dollar cell phones that I use would not
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.100]   be a significant event in my financial life.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:33.240]   But if my, let's say my 16 year old son comes to me and he's got no, he doesn't have a lot of money,
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.380]   but he's buying a premium cell phone. Now let's assume it's a good idea. Maybe he's making money
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:40.760]   on it. He's doing video and all the premium stuff that you can do on a cell phone, et cetera.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:48.460]   And he's making money at it. Then I would absolutely recommend that he gets the insurance because of
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:54.840]   his different financial status. For him, the loss of that cell phone could be a very significant event
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:01.820]   in his financial accumulation. And so this never changes the situation that you're living in with
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:08.220]   a house and saying, I'm not, I'm not insuring my house is, is a pro can be appropriate or not
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:13.180]   appropriate depending on the financial stage. So here are three simple, three simple comments to
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:19.020]   go in addition to that entire quadrant that I give in episode 91. The first thing to consider
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:25.740]   is the cost of the insurance. There is, there are insurance policies that are a great
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:31.680]   deal and there are insurance policies that are not a great deal. And depending on the cost of
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:38.240]   the insurance and the, you may make a certain choice. And, you know, the example I would use
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:44.940]   here is simply that I own long-term care insurance, right? So I, I, I've owned this since I was 20,
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:50.980]   probably 24 years old, 25 years old. It's not that I think I need long-term care insurance.
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:55.560]   In fact, every time I talk about it, I'm very clear that I don't need it. Nor would I ever
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:52:00.220]   recommend that someone has it. The reason I bought it in, in the, in the situation, unless
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:05.580]   it has these exact fact patterns. The reason I bought the insurance was that I was buying an
[01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:10.180]   insurance policy that I knew would never be available in the market again. And it was very
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:15.500]   inexpensive for me because of my age and I had the extra money. And so it's a good deal for me,
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:20.680]   even though I don't need the insurance and I wouldn't tell someone else unless they had those
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.240]   exact fact patterns where the product was going to disappear to have it. But I've had it for years
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:31.780]   and the cost of the insurance is fairly negligible. It's, it's triple deductible. And then from a tax
[01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:35.700]   perspective, it's a product that will never probably never be on the market again during my
[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:40.520]   lifetime. And so even though it's not technically necessary, it's something that I, that I own
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:45.840]   because the cost of the insurance was negligent, negligible. The second thing is you can consider
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:54.100]   the concept of adverse selection. And so you, in your own circumstances, you, the benefit that you
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.680]   have as an individual, you're going to be able to get a good deal of that. And so you, in your own
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:55.740]   circumstances, you, in your own circumstances, you, the benefit that you have as an individual, you,
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:01.180]   who's purchasing insurance is you have more personalized information than the insurance
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:08.860]   company has. So if there's something that, that is, you know, you face a higher risk for something,
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:18.500]   then you may be more willing to have insurance for it because of your unique personalized risk
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:25.660]   that someone else doesn't have. So let's say that you are a fisherman and you're always around the
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:31.360]   boat and you know that whatever cell phone you have is going to be rained on and it's likely to
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:36.820]   fall in the water when a big fish bites, et cetera. It's just what happens. Well, you might get the
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:41.040]   insurance where someone like me, who's generally in my office and who's very careful with electronic
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:46.680]   devices, I'm not going to do it because I'm very rarely on the water. And so if there's some
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:52.920]   personalized thing like that, so you, so floodplains and your, your knowledge of the flooding nature of
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.640]   a specific, your neighborhood or your house, or if you're in a place where you're in a place where
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:01.800]   your house is unique exposure to wind forces or unique, unique fire danger, et cetera, may cause
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:06.180]   you to have insurance. Whereas on the flip side, let's say that you know that your house is
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:11.100]   protected from wildfires and you know that all of the electrical wiring in your house has been
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:15.500]   up done and it's very unlikely for it to catch fire and you're, and you have good systems
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:20.620]   to protect your house from fire. Well then in your situation, you can feel really good about
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:25.480]   skipping it. And so your individualized knowledge is going to, is going to play a,
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:30.020]   a role as well in your ability to get stuff. And then number three is just simply going to be the
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:36.000]   importance of the outcome. So your instinct of what you said at the beginning, that insurance
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:43.260]   is a bad deal unless the, unless it's for catastrophic costs is the right, is the right
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:49.420]   mindset because that's normally true. And so if there's something that you just can't afford to
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:54.540]   do without this thing, then you insure it, but you don't necessarily always purchase insurance for it.
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:02.640]   There are multiple ways of insuring it. So as the cell phone example, I myself have and basically
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:10.220]   live with and travel with two cell phones. And the reason is that the catastrophic risk of not
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:16.020]   having a communications device ready to go is, is too significant for me because my entire life
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:21.180]   and the wellbeing of my family probably rests upon the having a functional phone.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:25.380]   So I've just upgraded phones more frequently than I otherwise would.
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:29.460]   I didn't buy insurance policies on them, but I have a mirror image phone ready to go
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:33.120]   that has everything loaded up so that if phone number one gets stolen out of my pocket,
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:38.640]   then phone number two is ready to go. And so the catastrophic risk for me is not being able to run
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.040]   my business, not having the communication things that I need, et cetera, and being, you know,
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:49.660]   incommunicado for a couple of days. But the, the solution is just a different form of insurance
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:54.720]   than just an insurance policy. So if something is catastrophic to you and it's really important and
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:55.560]   it would be a,
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:02.140]   a big deal for you, then you should insure it or you should not have it. And that's another way.
[01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:10.400]   So car here, a car is an example. Generally speaking, I think that people should not have
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:16.320]   cars that they need to have big expensive insurance policies on, but it's not that,
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.440]   so somebody could have, let's say you're, you're young, you don't have a ton of money. You go and
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.060]   you buy a brand new car and your insurance policy, because you're young is going to be very, very
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:32.920]   expensive. Well, looking at that, looking at that situation, it is absolutely true that somebody in
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:37.020]   that situation who's young, doesn't have a lot of money and bought this big expensive car with a big
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:42.480]   expensive insurance policy. It's very true that that person should have full coverage, collision
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:48.080]   liability, everything on that car because of the risk of loss being really catastrophic. But instead
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:54.020]   of doing that, I would rather see the person get rid of the big expensive car and buy a car that is
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:55.520]   so modest that they wouldn't need it. And so I think that's a really good way to look at it.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:25.500]   I think that's a really good way to look at it. And so I think that's a really good way to look at it.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:29.280]   And this also ties into a second question that's shorter, if you don't mind me asking that as well.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:29.760]   Go ahead.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:39.800]   So I recently bought a new vehicle and at the dealership, they were just amazed that I wouldn't
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:45.820]   want the extended warranty. And, and maybe that was false amazement because they just wanted to
[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:55.480]   sell it. But I said, well, first of all, you have to make money on that extended warranty. And
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:58:04.480]   My second thought was kind of what you just said, which is if I can't afford to repair this, then I should not be buying this vehicle in the first place.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:18.900]   And so second question, recently you had talked about car loans, and I got the impression that you were against it in maybe all cases or in most cases at least.
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:28.680]   And I wanted to push back, at least in my situation, I'd actually never purchased a new vehicle until the past year.
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:34.060]   But the interest rate was so low.
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:36.260]   And based on my...
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:41.460]   In my business, I do a lot of borrowing at higher rates than the car loan.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:50.180]   So to me, I thought it was a pretty clear decision to take it out on a loan instead of take it out in cash.
[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:53.660]   And I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that as well.
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:59:06.160]   Yeah, I'm 95% opposed to car loans because in most situations, they don't help improve the economic outcome.
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:07.680]   That's the economic outcome that somebody experiences.
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:10.440]   But let me back that up.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.260]   I'm 85% opposed to car loans.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:18.040]   But there is 15% of individualized circumstances where I think they're justifiable.
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:21.280]   And so your situation might be one of those.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:30.360]   And I can list off, off the top of my head, I could list off half a dozen situations in which I think a car loan would be perfectly fine and reasonable and smart.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   At its core, I would say that finance is not...
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:41.500]   Always a mathematical optimization structure of life.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:47.560]   And there's a very, very important to look at all finance through the lens of scale.
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:50.080]   So things like leasing cars.
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:51.140]   Let's just stick with that.
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:59.420]   Virtually all financial planners or financial pundits will say that leasing a car is suboptimal.
[01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:02.140]   Because it's just obvious that it's suboptimal.
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:05.320]   But we do suboptimal things.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.140]   All the time.
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:10.700]   And doing something that is suboptimal doesn't automatically mean that it's a mistake.
[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:19.540]   That we may choose to do something that is suboptimal because it's just not an important component of our overall life.
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:22.040]   And so things like cars.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:25.640]   I use variability to say, does the car matter for your career?
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:29.680]   For the vast majority of people, nobody cares what kind of car you drive.
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:34.360]   And going out and buying an expensive car.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:37.680]   So that they'll think better of me is a fool's errand.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.160]   It would be completely stupid.
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:45.900]   And yet there are people that based upon the image that is presented by their car, I would give the opposite advice.
[02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:53.180]   And so I think that any good responsible advice is going to understand the basic truths that exist.
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:55.880]   Why do we not always buy new cars?
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:02.820]   Well, because if we're always just upgrading, buying new cars, we're operating a vehicle at the most expensive cycle of its life.
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.380]   And then that person...
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:05.920]   Why does a person would look for the counter truths?
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:13.160]   Why does public supermarkets, where I'm from, public supermarkets is the thing.
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:19.740]   Public supermarkets has an enormous fleet of basically brand new trucks that as best I can tell are all leased.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:20.320]   Why?
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.040]   Why?
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.480]   Why wouldn't public supermarkets be frugal and drive their trucks until they're 20 years old?
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:34.360]   Because for a supermarket, the most important thing is not having the absolute truth.
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:45.060]   The most important thing is having a fleet of trucks that work all the time so that every store always has everything that it needs.
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:52.000]   And so the point is, I mean, I'm fine with ambiguity.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.000]   It's why I'll never be as successful as Dave Ramsey with his dogged commitment to his single message.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.460]   But I do want to be honest with the ambiguity.
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:04.280]   So, you know, like what you're saying.
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:09.640]   Is the car a lower form of financing than other forms of financing that are available to you?
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:10.740]   Sure.
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:11.460]   Absolutely.
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:20.340]   But in buying a $50,000 car or whatever you bought, did you immediately go and pay down $50,000 of a higher interest rate debt?
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:22.260]   I guess it would be probably not.
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:25.140]   And so a lot of these games are, okay, it's fine.
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:33.900]   But, you know, it's also not, you know, we don't usually follow through as much as we would like to think that we do on all of the details.
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:34.260]   But...
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:34.900]   But we don't have to.
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:35.700]   You don't have to be perfect.
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:37.020]   You just got to get the big things right.
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:45.800]   And so in your situation, I would doubt very much that your car purchase is a problem for you based upon your overall financial situation.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:51.920]   But if you were 22 years old and you're working a minimum wage job and you're coming off and showing your brand new Kia,
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:55.520]   I would yell and want to slap you across the face for your stupidity.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:00.980]   But it's not because buying a car or not buying a new car or not buying a new car is morally right.
[02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:04.060]   It has to do much more with the overall impact of your...
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:12.620]   Of your life and its relevance to your overall situation and your lifestyle and the decisions that it opens up or closes off for you.
[02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:16.060]   Yep.
[02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:16.860]   Okay.
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:18.860]   I think that makes sense.
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:21.180]   Yeah.
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:33.720]   And in my circumstance in the business that I work in, which is like real estate investment, flipping and such, my debt changes so much.
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:38.860]   Month to month, depending on where I am in a project, that it really...
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:41.620]   You know, the debt is fungible.
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:51.860]   So I feel like, okay, well, $40,000 at 3% as opposed to an extra $40,000 on another deal at 9%.
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:53.880]   Right.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:54.720]   Depending on the month.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:55.580]   Right, right.
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:56.880]   And you may follow through.
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:58.820]   So at its core, we don't have...
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:03:59.960]   Again, we don't have to be perfect.
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:03.820]   We're not in personal finance to just make everything mathematically optimized.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:09.820]   If it were mathematically optimized, we would all go around with all of our clothes bought from Goodwill for our entire lifetime.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:11.580]   None of us are going to do that.
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:13.540]   This is personal finance.
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:21.120]   And so there are many, many points in life in which we don't do the optimal thing because we don't want to.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.620]   We want to live a different way.
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:24.000]   And that's perfectly fine.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:33.100]   The only appropriate litmus test or the only appropriate standard to compare your actions to is your goals.
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:36.120]   It's the achievement of your goals.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:43.300]   And if you are achieving your goals and you understand what you're giving up by achieving your goals, then that is fine.
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:48.680]   And so the example I like to use, I have a family member who likes to drive nice cars.
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:51.680]   Doesn't buy them brand new but likes to drive nice cars.
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:53.600]   I make a different choice.
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.320]   And it's not that I don't understand the value of a nice car.
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:00.900]   Most of the brand new cars I drive are cars that I rent.
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:03.060]   But I spend a lot more.
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:07.260]   In international travel than he does on his nice cars.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:11.560]   And he doesn't seem to be interested in international travel, which I totally get.
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:14.040]   I don't think you should be interested in national travel if you're not.
[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.120]   It's a lot of work.
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:15.820]   It's a lot of hassle.
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:17.240]   It's a lot more comfortable to stay at home.
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:22.600]   And so I have complete and full respect for a guy who says, I'm happy to stay at home.
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:26.000]   And this is not my family member, but I'm happy to stay at home.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.560]   I'm happy to do my international traveling with my big screen TV.
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:32.840]   And I like having a nice car and I make the money for it and I can pay for it.
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:35.620]   And to me, that's perfectly fine.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:43.360]   The only reason that would be a mistake is if he didn't understand what he was giving up.
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:50.200]   And so if we look at all personal finance advice, it basically comes through the lens of the unexplored alternative.
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:56.820]   So why does Dave Ramsey say, don't ever buy a new car unless you're a millionaire and his other rules?
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:06:02.440]   Well, because majority of people, their cars are causing them to be broke.
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:06.220]   Their cars are keeping them in a lifestyle of no peace.
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:11.520]   They don't have financial peace because they have a bunch of payments and they're stuck in a job they don't like,
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:17.440]   driving down a road in a vehicle they'll never own to impress people that don't care about them.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:20.860]   And so you look at that situation and you say to somebody,
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:28.920]   don't you understand that this one simple decision of not driving such a ridiculous expensive car and not having payments
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:30.940]   could lead you to a lifestyle of freedom?
[02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:32.220]   You could get a job that you like.
[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:32.580]   You could quit your job.
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.520]   You could quit your work, et cetera.
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:35.120]   Don't you understand that?
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:37.620]   Now, along comes someone even more hardcore.
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:45.520]   Someone who says, don't you understand that your car in and of itself of any cost is causing you to give up on early retirement?
[02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:49.000]   And you could be retired in five years, but you're driving this car instead.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.500]   And so the person who's super dogmatic is the one who wants to retire in five years.
[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:56.560]   And they would much rather retire in five years than give up their car.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:57.640]   That's perfectly fine.
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:07:00.580]   But someone else may look at it and say, I don't want to retire in five years.
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:01.680]   And that's fine as well.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.380]   We're not dealing with.
[02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:05.920]   We're dealing with moral right and wrong where we have objective, clear moral values.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:13.540]   We're dealing with your standard should be my goals, my vision, and my ability to achieve that.
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:21.120]   And then you should also make sure that your goals are fully informed by what are all the alternative choices that you could make.
[02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:25.940]   And then within that, we're going to choose differently one person over another.
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:29.460]   I myself, I just assume live in a place where I don't need a car.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:30.460]   I don't like them.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:30.880]   I don't.
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:31.580]   I've driven.
[02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:35.120]   I don't want to say millions of miles, but I've driven a lot.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.100]   And at this point in time, I just assume live where I don't have a car car.
[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:42.620]   But, you know, someone else can make a completely different decision.
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.560]   And that's perfectly fine.
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:48.160]   As long as you know what you're giving up and as long as you know what your goals are, then that's fine.
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.560]   I don't think it's we're not it's not right or wrong.
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:54.800]   It's just shades of idealization towards your specific goals.
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:08:00.200]   This mythical standard of your ideal outcome and how quickly you want to get there and what style you want to arrive.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.980]   That's great.
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:04.380]   Yeah.
[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:07.440]   And my outlook has definitely changed in the last 20 years.
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:14.040]   I think I was on the extreme idealistic side in my twenties.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:16.460]   And honestly, that's at that time.
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:21.700]   I think that probably helps me so when I don't have to live in a cardboard box.
[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:22.420]   Right.
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:22.840]   Right.
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:22.920]   Yeah.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:24.360]   Rules are helpful.
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:24.960]   They're clear.
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:28.580]   Um, I mentioned Dave here a couple times.
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:29.160]   Dave Ramsey.
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:29.980]   But it's, it's, it's.
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:30.920]   It's what I tell people.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.340]   It's like, you will never go wrong following Dave's advice.
[02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:37.200]   If by wrong, you mean being in financial trouble, et cetera.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.440]   Like you're always going to be right.
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.220]   You may just may not get the most ideal outcome, right?
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:49.300]   You may not be as rich as you would otherwise by using leverage in your real estate investing, obviously, but you're never going to make a mistake.
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:53.960]   And so that those advice and those rules are, I think, really important.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:58.480]   And all of us decide how much we want to pay heed to them.
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:59.580]   Uh, because.
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:02.580]   We're not going to be able to pay the full price of our own, of our own goals.
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:03.580]   So that's all I have to say.
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:04.580]   Anything else, Jose?
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:05.580]   I know we're good.
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:06.580]   Thank you so much.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.580]   My pleasure.
