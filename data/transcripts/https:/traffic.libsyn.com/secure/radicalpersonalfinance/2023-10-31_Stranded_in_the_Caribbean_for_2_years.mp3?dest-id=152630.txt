[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.120]   My small family spent two years of our lives
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.300]   essentially stateless, stranded at sea,
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.440]   18,000 kilometers from home,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.920]   floating on 40 feet of fiberglass.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.300]   Freedom to transact literally became a matter
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.540]   of life or death.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.000]   This is our story.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840]   Australia locked its citizens out
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.800]   from returning during the pandemic.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.340]   My family, wife and three kids,
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.600]   three, five, and six months old,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.200]   were sailing on a catamaran
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.660]   in the Eastern Caribbean at the time.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.140]   We ended up there for two years waiting out the pandemic.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.260]   When the pandemic hit, we essentially became stateless.
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.560]   For a time, all countries within sailing distance
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.180]   closed their borders to Australian-flagged vessels.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.640]   No flights or crews.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.740]   My son couldn't renew his passport,
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.080]   and we had to get him temporary refugee papers.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.540]   Initially, we got locked down for 91 days on our boat
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.440]   in an overseas territory of France.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.520]   The Gendarme Nautique, water police,
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.600]   prohibited us from leaving the boat.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.840]   We technically weren't even allowed to swim off the boat at anchor.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.700]   Early on, desperate to get the kids some exercise,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.000]   we took the boat to the port of Paris,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.040]   and we took the boat to the port of Paris.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.160]   We took the boat to the port of Paris,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.180]   and we took the boat to the port of Paris.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.220]   We took the boat to the port of Paris,
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.240]   and we took the boat to the port of Paris.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.280]   We took the boat to the port of Paris,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.340]   and we took the boat to the port of Paris,
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.620]   and we took the boat to the port of Paris,
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.520]   and we took the dinghy to an isolated beach.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.360]   The Gendarme came with guns and megaphones
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.480]   to enforce our isolation.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.460]   The next day, a mini-aircraft carrier arrived,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.260]   and military control was implemented on the island.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.800]   Hurricane season arrived while we were still in lockdown,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.260]   ramping up the stress.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.240]   We provisioned to head to sea if a hurricane approached.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.540]   Stateless, the last resort plan was to drift,
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.600]   and we took the boat to the port of Paris,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.960]   and we drifted at sea, waiting out the season.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.580]   I studied the weather manically.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.660]   Months passed.
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.600]   Hurricanes became imminent.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.360]   The outlook dire.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.520]   Then Grenada saved us.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.340]   They let 1,200 stranded boats in,
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.060]   despite their borders being completely shut.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.900]   A tiny, poor country was saving us
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.860]   when my own affluent country was blocking its citizens.
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.220]   This hit home hard.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.820]   We sailed three days nonstop to Grenada.
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.140]   Too late in the season, we faced terrible weather,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.360]   experiencing multiple frontal systems,
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.960]   winds of 30 to 40 plus knots,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   and at one point, three tornadic water spouts
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.420]   closed in around us while the gooseneck bolt
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.720]   on the boom vibrated loose.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.480]   Two more weeks of quarantine,
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.740]   then freedom after four months restricted to the boat.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.200]   Noah then said,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.020]   then issued a hurricane warning
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.400]   with a track map directly over us.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.020]   We scrambled to prepare and tie to the mangroves.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.940]   Thankfully, it fizzled out and passed just south of us.
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.360]   As time went by, we became forgotten citizens.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.000]   Freedom to transact issues began to arise.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.320]   We had been living in Canada for the three years prior
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.280]   on global expert visas.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.840]   Canada had also locked us out.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.180]   It remained a secret.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.500]   We remained open to citizens and permanent residents,
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.880]   but not to work visa holders.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.380]   Our Canadian bank cards expired,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.360]   and we needed to be physically in Canada
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.760]   to activate new ones.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.920]   Subsequently, our online banking account
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.440]   was suspended for suspicious activity.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.880]   Again, we were required to go into a branch to remedy,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.840]   which was impossible.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.680]   Our Australian bank access also became restricted.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.500]   After roaming overseas for too long,
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.260]   our Australian phone SIMs expired,
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.800]   and we lost access to our two-factor authentication numbers
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.000]   needed for access to our bank accounts there.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.280]   To obtain a new SIM,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.100]   we needed to provide government-approved ID
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.060]   and activate from within Australia.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.940]   Again, the familiar response was,
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.100]   come into the bank and we can sort this out.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.740]   Loss of freedom of movement
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.140]   essentially led to a loss of freedom
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.660]   to travel.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.280]   We had no freedom to transact.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.580]   Fortunately, we had access to family
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.500]   who could help us out,
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.940]   and the bank agreed,
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.860]   after much pleading over the phone,
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.240]   to accept a phone number of a family member
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.540]   for two-factor authentication.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.760]   But the lesson was clear.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.020]   Without freedom to transact,
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.860]   you have very limited options
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.260]   to sustain life.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.600]   The Australian government
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.740]   had placed a Level 4 travel ban
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.080]   on the entire world for its citizens,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.640]   previously reserved for the Australian government.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.600]   This immediately rendered
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.980]   both our travel
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.480]   and health insurance policies void
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.500]   due to exemption clauses
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.880]   for travel to Level 4 areas.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.860]   The Panama Canal
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.420]   then shut to vessels
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.620]   under 80 feet,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.800]   and so began two
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.400]   often stressful years at sea,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.900]   18,000 kilometers
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.680]   from home,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.240]   reliant on the benevolence of small foreign countries
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.620]   to provide the very shelter
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.920]   that our own country refused to render.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.060]   In this crazy chapter of our lives,
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.080]   we faced numerous challenges,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.000]   yet savored incredible family experiences.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.360]   Chiseled by the stress,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.060]   we entered a heightened state of existence,
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.000]   ultimately transforming it
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.880]   into the most extraordinary time of our lives.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.840]   Navigating through immense technical
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.140]   and geopolitical intricacies,
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.600]   we journeyed using little more than wisdom
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   to explore the world's most beautiful and most beautiful places.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.440]   We traveled across 15 countries and territories
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.460]   during the pandemic.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.520]   With the absence of cruise ships and flights,
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.860]   the Caribbean's remote tranquility
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.320]   echoed the serenity of the 1950s.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.600]   Sailing into endless sunsets,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.680]   dolphins playfully surfed our bows awake
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.100]   as the stars emerged in the evening sky.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.020]   We saw numerous volcanic islands
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.640]   materialize on the horizon
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.480]   and explored untouched jungles
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.580]   and secluded waterfalls.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.300]   We spent time with the kids,
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.040]   wildlife spotting for monkeys,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.180]   iguanas, bird colonies,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.900]   exploring volcanic landscapes,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.740]   relaxing in hot springs,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.320]   swimming and diving over the reef
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.440]   with turtles and schools of fish,
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.680]   just enjoying the sea and each other
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.760]   as we watched the kids grow up.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.920]   Endless hours at the beach,
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.620]   meeting other stranded families
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.600]   from all over the world
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.500]   with vastly different backgrounds,
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   but ultimately a shared story.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.240]   A common experience to bond us together.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.860]   We ran our own renewable power systems,
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.280]   solar and wind into a lithium bank.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.940]   We made our own water
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.320]   via a small desalination unit,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.560]   caught our own fish,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.120]   drank rum punch,
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.740]   and watched the green flash
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.540]   from more remote beaches
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.320]   than one could expect to see
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.680]   in tens of lifetimes.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.200]   Not all roses, obviously.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.100]   The flip side was the challenges
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.040]   of raising a baby girl and two boys,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.320]   including doing homeschool
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.620]   in a confined space.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.820]   Coming up to speed under duress
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.540]   as landlubbers with the realities
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.540]   of sailing, navigation, weather routing,
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.560]   and all boat systems.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.960]   Constantly working on the seemingly
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.520]   infinite list of boat maintenance jobs.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.620]   Endless time spent provisioning
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.560]   and looking for parts.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.540]   Fitting in the time to work remotely
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.900]   to keep us alive financially.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.700]   Dragging anchor in midnight squalls,
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.480]   having other boats drag around you.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.700]   Enduring sleep deprivation
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.800]   from anchor alarms
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.980]   and a breastfeeding infant,
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.140]   we somehow,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.980]   persevered on multi-day sails
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.740]   without access to additional crew,
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.160]   testing our limits.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.740]   We then faced extended lockdowns
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.820]   and quarantines everywhere upon arrival.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.200]   The mental angst of that initial 91 days
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.780]   of lockdown and the hurricane belt,
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.300]   hoping that borders would open somewhere
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.960]   for Australian flagged vessels
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.680]   before the hurricane season started,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.580]   be with me for life.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.480]   Certainly the hardest thing
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.620]   we have done as a family.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.860]   The 18 months that followed
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.840]   was a sublimely beautiful,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.360]   yet at times crushingly difficult.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.640]   In hindsight,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.860]   the most meaningful time in our lives.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.460]   When we finally made it home to Australia
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.780]   after two years
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.820]   floating on 40 feet of fiberglass,
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.980]   it felt like an alternate reality.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.140]   People at home stressing
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.640]   about the smallest of issues
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.560]   and arguing over trivial things.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.660]   The Australia I left,
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.780]   a nation of prolific travelers,
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.820]   was now scared of foreigners
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.560]   in a way I had never thought possible
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.200]   in my life.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.080]   Something had been lost
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.200]   in the population here.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.520]   They had their own lockdown trauma.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.180]   In a bizarre way,
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.280]   being stranded at sea
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.420]   liberated us from it.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.680]   Forged by circumstance,
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.240]   intermeshed into the physical world around us,
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.060]   our preconceived boundaries
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.820]   of what was possible in life
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.220]   physically and emotionally
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.260]   had been removed.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.040]   Yet in other ways,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.900]   it led to a kind of PTSD
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.820]   reintegrating into society.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.740]   Everyone took for granted
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.600]   simple freedoms like freedom of movement,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.280]   freedom to always be able to return
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.200]   to your home country,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   and freedom to transact.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.900]   We knew firsthand how fragile it all was.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.700]   I held back releasing ocean work
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.620]   or even this story
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.800]   as I needed time to process the experience.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.460]   After two years of being back on land,
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.720]   I created the Intrepid Ocean series
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.880]   to attempt to work through
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.120]   these thoughts and emotions.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.060]   The experience highlighted the fragility
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.120]   of the global norms and governance systems
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.000]   we take for granted.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.420]   Now, after three years back in Australia,
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.300]   we are heading back to our boat
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.920]   in the Caribbean to finish what we started.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.380]   The kids are now four, eight, and ten.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.680]   So, here we are again on the precipice
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.580]   about to jump off
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.560]   to find out who we truly are
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.760]   as individuals, as a family.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.620]   The essay I have just read to you
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.900]   was a Twitter post
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.260]   by an account named Intrepid.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.400]   The handle is at Intrepid underscore P.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.240]   Intrepid also answered
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.440]   a couple of questions
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.260]   that were asked by listeners
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.180]   that I think are really useful
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.300]   and illuminating.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.000]   Angie says,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.260]   I can't believe Australia locked you out.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.840]   Was there a specific reason?
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.800]   My cousin had been in America
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.840]   for over ten years
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.620]   and it took a while,
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.000]   but he flew back into Australia
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.940]   after maybe five months into the pandemic.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.740]   Intrepid responds,
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.400]   It's complex,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.580]   but essentially,
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.100]   initially in the first six to eight months,
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.720]   there were no flights
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.780]   out of where we were.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.880]   The airport,
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.780]   simply shut
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.360]   on the small island nations.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.440]   By the time they relaxed
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.140]   and opened up,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.400]   the quotas into Australia
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.780]   had been reduced
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.840]   and then reduced again
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.860]   and were as low as 3,000 per week
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.340]   with over 50,000 Australians
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.160]   registered with DFAT
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.020]   and probably four times not registered
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.200]   wanting to come home.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.720]   This drove flight prices
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.600]   to astronomical levels,
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.400]   peaked at 80,000 Australian dollars
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.480]   per person from London.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.040]   Not obvious,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.740]   but obviously an option
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.540]   for five of us
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.500]   to spend a quarter of a million flying home.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.440]   The reality was
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.460]   Australia kept granting exemptions
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.820]   for critical business trips
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.740]   out of Australia
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.280]   and most of the 3,000 cap
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.540]   was taken by high-priced business travel
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.420]   for whom paying $50,000
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.760]   was not an issue.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.680]   Stark contrast to the New Zealand system
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.900]   where they ran a lottery ticket system
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.540]   to come home
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.000]   rather than let the market decide
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.100]   who could pay to come home.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.520]   We finally managed to book flights
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:55.960]   via,
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.840]   American Airlines,
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.100]   via Los Angeles
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.440]   after like 18 months.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.580]   And even then,
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.460]   just before we flew,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.960]   they halved the quota again
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.720]   after we booked.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.300]   American Airlines,
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.000]   to meet this,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.420]   then simply cancelled
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.460]   every second flight
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.860]   and rebooked people
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.920]   six down the track.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.780]   We, by chance,
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.180]   survived this cull.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.880]   The quota at those levels
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.620]   meant that each flight
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.440]   from LA to Sydney
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.640]   only had 32 passengers on it.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.440]   This was not sustainable
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.780]   and so six weeks later,
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.800]   Americans stopped flying
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.760]   completely Australia
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.940]   and just flew free.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:26.160]   Great.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.880]   On arrival home
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.360]   after having all been vaccinated
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.220]   and having two PCR tests
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.200]   and a week of flying
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.680]   and one on arrival,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.140]   we then had to pay $5,500
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.120]   to quarantine
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.480]   for two weeks on arrival.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.440]   Same building as the athletes
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.900]   returning from Tokyo Olympics.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.220]   For the $5,500,
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.980]   we got a small hotel room
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.600]   with two beds for five people.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.840]   All up,
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.580]   it cost us close to $50,000
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.620]   to get home
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.120]   even after waiting 18 months
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.920]   since the initial lockdown.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.660]   Another question
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.380]   that was asked.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.280]   Wow, truly impressive story.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.000]   Some questions.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.260]   One, how did you access internet?
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.460]   Two, were you using crypto
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.460]   in the Caribbean as a currency
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.640]   since your bank cards were cut?
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.240]   And three, same boat
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.100]   for this new voyage?
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.800]   One, we would try and get local SIMs
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.960]   from each country we went to.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.120]   Internet, however,
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.560]   was difficult in most places.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.360]   I had a 4G router
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.480]   with external aerial
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.500]   so we could point them
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.240]   across the ocean
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.480]   and get service from land.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.900]   This time, we have
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.360]   Starlink,
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.400]   so it should be different.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.900]   Two, sadly,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.180]   I was using crypto at the time
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.100]   but could not use it directly.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.080]   The islands were very much
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.840]   cash economy
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.120]   but I could use a portal
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.780]   in Australia
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.860]   than a wise card
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.140]   to withdraw local cash.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.400]   And three, yes, same boat.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.740]   We left it in Aruba
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.880]   when we finally came home.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.120]   We did not trust the flights
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.940]   would actually leave
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.160]   so could not risk
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.720]   having nowhere to return to
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.860]   by selling it.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.500]   Fluke asked a question.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.620]   Wow, this is wild.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.760]   Being Australian,
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.400]   we were warned
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.880]   to return home
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.400]   immediately
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.620]   or be locked out of the country.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.500]   Was there no ability
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.180]   to leave your boat
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.140]   and just fly back
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.240]   when that call came out?
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.260]   Intrepid responds,
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.380]   no.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.080]   France went into lockdown
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.260]   prior to Australia
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.060]   when Italy had its first outbreaks
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.740]   of the pandemic
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.460]   and basically,
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.980]   the airport in St. Martin
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.460]   shut,
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.880]   even to medical evacuations.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.980]   We had no physical options
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.760]   to fly home
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.020]   for about eight months.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.140]   By then,
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.780]   it was financially prohibitive.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.000]   Flights from London
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.740]   peaked at $80,000 per person
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.520]   at the worst of it.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.640]   Essentially,
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.140]   the quota of 3,000 people
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.780]   was taken up
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.760]   by business travelers
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.620]   who got an exemption
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.800]   to fly out of Australia.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.100]   This is why
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.660]   the 50,000 stranded people
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.080]   registered with DFAT
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.780]   essentially stayed at that level
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.900]   for most of the pandemic
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.700]   and was probably
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.220]   four times that in reality.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.020]   This is in stark contrast
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.720]   to New Zealand
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.680]   who ran the quota
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.320]   as a lottery
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.200]   and then you bought the flights
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.260]   rather than let airlines
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:49.900]   use the market
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.020]   to decide who got in.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.640]   Even at the end,
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.780]   after almost two years,
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.200]   when we finally got flights
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.840]   out of Los Angeles,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.240]   which still cost $50,000
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.260]   for the family,
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.320]   ScoMo halved the quota
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.660]   one last time
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.000]   and American Airlines
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.800]   simply had to cut
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.680]   every second flight
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.660]   and rebooked eight months
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.400]   down the track.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.300]   We luckily made that cut
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:09.980]   and came home
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.880]   to then pay $5,500
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.480]   in quarantine fees
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.380]   despite having been vaccinated
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.140]   and having three PCR tests
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.720]   that week.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.300]   Six weeks later,
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.220]   American basically stopped flying
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:21.900]   as they were limited
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.340]   to something like 32 people
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:23.900]   per jet
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.220]   under the new rules
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:25.820]   and only flew
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.180]   freight.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.820]   To be honest,
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.000]   that was one of the most
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.820]   frustrating things
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.420]   coming home.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.620]   People had this view like,
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.960]   we gave you four weeks
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.620]   to come home.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.640]   And it's like,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.300]   FFS,
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.180]   there is no way
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:36.700]   a lot of people
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.440]   could come home.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.060]   The French side of St. Martin
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.080]   does not even have
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.120]   an international airport
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.520]   and they closed the border
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.380]   to the Dutch side.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.680]   So even if it remained open,
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.180]   there would have been
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.380]   no way to cross.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.540]   So I'll stop
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.360]   with all the questions,
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.880]   although I thought
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.600]   it was interesting
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.860]   to talk about.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.380]   I want you to think
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.880]   about that story this week
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.800]   as you consider
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.960]   your own situation.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.940]   Now, most of us,
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.320]   of course,
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.080]   are never going to face
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.940]   something like that.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.560]   Probably it'll be
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.580]   a few more decades
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.300]   before another pandemic comes,
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.360]   maybe 50 years,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:07.840]   who knows.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.680]   And a global pandemic
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.160]   is a unique risk.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.940]   It's the only thing
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.220]   that I can come up with
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.000]   that results in a global
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.480]   closure of borders
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.080]   and such
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.840]   all at the exact same time.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.160]   It's the only thing
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.640]   that I know
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.800]   that has that globally
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.340]   simultaneous impact.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.880]   There are many other things
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.340]   that can affect regions,
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.240]   but the only thing
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.040]   I've ever come up with
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.500]   that has that simultaneous
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.380]   global impact
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.060]   is a pandemic.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.200]   But it's good to stress test
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.960]   and think about,
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.920]   well, what happens
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.660]   in terms of
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.660]   how do you prepare for that?
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.960]   And what you see
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.820]   is the importance
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.160]   of being prepared
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.260]   to be isolated.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.660]   That leads to
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.560]   physical preparedness.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   But more importantly,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.180]   in this case,
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.040]   you see the importance
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.660]   of backup plans
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.080]   from a documentary
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:55.760]   that you can use
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   to help you
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   get through
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.360]   this particular
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.440]   this particular
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.140]   writer, intrepid.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.260]   You would think
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.140]   that he was pretty
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.880]   well squared away.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.800]   Had a great passport
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.920]   from a great country.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.740]   Tier A passport.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.600]   Had the ability
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.900]   to go and live
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.800]   and work in Canada.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.480]   That's a good start.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.060]   And yet,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.900]   found himself
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.860]   completely trapped
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.680]   because it wasn't
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.320]   good enough.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.580]   And I tell you what,
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.380]   the pandemic
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.360]   was definitely
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.420]   motivating to me
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:22.980]   and a whole lot
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.620]   of other people
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.200]   to make sure
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:25.740]   you don't only have
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.220]   one residence,
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:27.920]   but you have
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.980]   multiple countries
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.640]   that you can legally
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.400]   go and live in.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   In most cases,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.520]   I think that tourists
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.340]   are treated better
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.940]   in countries
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.100]   than residents are.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.480]   But when it comes
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.060]   to access to a country,
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.300]   residents are treated
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.240]   ineffably better
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:41.940]   than tourists.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.500]   So you want to have
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.920]   high quality residencies
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.520]   and you want to have
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.180]   multiple citizenships
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.180]   if at all possible.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.320]   Multiple places
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.100]   where you can go
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.820]   and live
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.480]   and be treated
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.800]   like a citizen.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.160]   And the basic
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.720]   value
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.660]   of citizenship
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.820]   is unrestricted
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.380]   right to enter
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:18:59.860]   a country.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.320]   How Australia
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:01.900]   got around
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.660]   with restricting
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.280]   that right
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.300]   is something
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.700]   that is interesting
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.360]   to look at.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.420]   They didn't restrict
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.040]   it legally.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.220]   They used the market
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.320]   to enforce
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.060]   their restrictions.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.460]   And so they said,
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.500]   oh, Australian citizens
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.300]   can come back.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.780]   But they highly
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.940]   limited the entrance
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.400]   of people.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.200]   And then because
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.960]   Australia is such
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.860]   a remote destination,
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.820]   they said,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.380]   you can come back.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:24.980]   And of course,
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.600]   you'll do,
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.680]   two weeks of quarantine
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.180]   in an expensive hotel camp
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.260]   that we're going to set up
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:29.700]   for you.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.920]   But then they limit,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.580]   use the market
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.820]   to limit the flow of people.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.000]   And so it was quite
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.740]   an interesting workaround
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.360]   where they,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.580]   they forbade
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.540]   their citizens entrance
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.280]   for a time.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   And then they use
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.080]   the market conditions
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.040]   to keep them low.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.360]   So Australians,
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.280]   that should affect you
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.240]   dramatically in terms
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.100]   of how your government
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:49.700]   handled that.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.840]   Anyway,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.360]   I don't have anything
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:51.740]   more to say.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.220]   Just want to share
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.120]   that interesting story.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.240]   I'll link it in the show notes
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.960]   published on Twitter
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.680]   two days ago.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.060]   So in closing,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.600]   make sure to go.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.400]   And if you're interested
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.540]   in thinking about
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.620]   and planning for solutions
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.120]   and talking with me
