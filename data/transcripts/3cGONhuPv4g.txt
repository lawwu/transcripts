[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.780]   John Luskin: Welcome to the 59th edition of the Bogleheads on Investing podcast.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.100]   Today our special guest is Dr. William Sharpe.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.860]   I'm John Luskin and I normally host our Bogleheads live show for the folks of Twitter.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:37.260]   I'll be taking over for the normal host, Rick Ferry, while he takes a summer sabbatical.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.060]   Please allow me to introduce Dr. William Sharpe.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.020]   He was one of the originators of the capital asset pricing model, developed the Sharpe
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.980]   ratio for investment performance analysis, and developed other methods for the evaluation
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.260]   of options, asset allocation optimization, and investment return analysis for evaluating
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260]   the style and performance of investment funds.
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.940]   Dr. Sharpe has published articles in a number of professional journals and is a past president
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.860]   of the American Finance Association.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.500]   In 1990, he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on the capital asset
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.980]   pricing model.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.700]   You can learn more about Dr. Sharpe at wsharpe.com.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.820]   Some announcements before we get started on today's episode with Dr. Bill Sharpe.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.620]   This episode of the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, as with all episodes, is brought
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.420]   to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, a nonprofit organization that is

[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.460]   And with that, let's get started on our interview with Dr. William Sharp.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.120]   Bill, welcome to the 59th Bogleheads on Investing Podcast.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   My pleasure.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.380]   In 1990, you jointly received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Harry Markowitz and
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.460]   Martin Miller for your work on the capital asset pricing model.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.160]   Tell us about the capital asset pricing model.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.600]   The idea is that the more securities you have in a portfolio, the less important is the
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.620]   risk that's specific to a given stock, whether it be from the company's activities or from
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.660]   the industry it's in.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.880]   So as you put more and more securities in a portfolio, what we call idiosyncratic risk,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.400]   the risk that's attributable to the fact that General Motors or the fact that it's in the
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.800]   auto industry, that risk tends to be diversified away.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.280]   And as you diversify more, the risk in your portfolio becomes predominantly due to what's
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.800]   going on in the broader market.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.360]   So certainly Bogleheads are fully subscribed to this.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.680]   We love diversification and we love those low cost index funds.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.560]   We want the return of the market.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.960]   We're not necessarily putting all our money into just one individual stock and that helps
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.880]   manage risk.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.040]   Let's jump to one of our questions that we got from Twitter.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.360]   This question is from a user named Levi who writes, "Do you still fully subscribe to the
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.000]   capital asset price model?"
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   Well, it's a model and models abstract from reality in various ways and get results based
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.720]   on what goes into the model, what you assume in the model.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.760]   The CAPM, the original version in the dissertation assumed that all stocks had risk that came
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.600]   from "the market" and then idiosyncratic risk that was unique to them and not correlated
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.000]   with anything else going on.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.280]   So in that sense, it assumed, it was not perhaps surprising I got the result that expected
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.880]   returns would be related to beta values, that is sensitivity to the market.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.820]   The broader model used just the idea that the more diversified your portfolio, the greater
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.440]   would be the component of risk in that portfolio that was attributable to the market as a whole.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.280]   And so in a sense it did not assume that the market was the only source of returns.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.840]   It in some sense got bad results that the market portfolio was predominantly, I should
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.000]   say to be careful, the risk for which there would be rewards and higher expected returns.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   There was a radical difference between the two.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.840]   And some people who knew the first were, had thought that the second result, the CAPM resulted
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.260]   from assuming the "single index model," that is that only market risk was the correlated
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.400]   risk in securities, it did not.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:15.560]   Again, if you have enough stocks that will diversify away and be of much less importance
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.720]   and therefore not rewarded, the non-market part would not be rewarded in higher expected
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.840]   returns.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.960]   This question is from David from Twitter who writes, "It would be great if Dr. Sharpe
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.320]   could comment on CAPM assumptions and the degree to which the model's value has changed
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.640]   as markets have evolved."
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:42.360]   It's hard to describe to somebody in today's world how irrelevant the stock market was
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.820]   for most human beings back in the 50s and 60s.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:54.280]   Relatively few people had individual stocks, there were not 401k plans, and there certainly
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.280]   weren't as many securities as there are now, or as many different exchanges, et cetera.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:08.880]   At the time, the idea was that the market as a whole could be sufficiently dominant
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:17.120]   in expected returns that it would be a high, high, high percentage of the influence on
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.320]   expected returns.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.420]   Now there was the idea that only the beta of a security would have an impact on its
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.880]   expected returns.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.560]   That was a pretty far out assumption.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.840]   Now there are so many securities, so many markets for that matter, and so many people
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:43.480]   who own securities that nowhere else in their 401ks or 3Bs, I think it's to me at least
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.720]   a more comfortable assumption.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.160]   Let's jump to measuring risk next.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.380]   This question comes from username 95 suited from the Bill Bled's forums who writes, "Should
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:02.800]   investors consider volatility to be the primary measure of risk when constructing financial
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.640]   portfolios?"
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.720]   I would say yes, if they have a bunch of securities or a mutual fund that has a bunch of securities
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.000]   or multiple mutual funds.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.760]   Obviously, if they have an investment portfolio of three stocks, there's a lot of non-market
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   risk in that portfolio.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.340]   But if they do what bobbleheads might, by and large, I would assume do, yes.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.340]   Yes, certainly.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.820]   I wonder if 95 suited is referring to some other risks that long-term investors might
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.900]   face, such as inflation risk.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.620]   That's to say, if you don't want to take volatility as a risk, the risk that your investments
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:46.060]   decrease in value, then you're not necessarily getting rid of all risk so much as you're
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:52.620]   trading that one risk, volatility, for another risk, which is inflation.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.060]   If you're not going to invest in assets like stocks that have historically grown more than
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.980]   inflation, then you might be looking at your wealth decreasing over the long term.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.920]   Well, I think there's a very strong argument that for most people, the returns that matter
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.340]   are real returns, inflation adjusts.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.500]   Now, you know, we can talk about how important is inflation for old people versus young people,
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:23.420]   but in a sense, I would favor thinking of returns not as nominal returns, but as real
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.420]   returns.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.460]   Pick your country and time period.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.460]   Inflation may be dominant.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.980]   It may, if you're lucky, for a short period in some countries be sort of minimal, as we
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.340]   well know and as we're experiencing.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.660]   In most countries, in many times, inflation is important.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.580]   So in some sense, it's easy to just do everything in real returns.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:50.340]   When I'm doing projections, Monte Carlo, what have you, I tend to like to do it all in real
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.340]   returns.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:57.660]   Then the literature, there's an argument that for retired people, inflation may not be quite
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:03.420]   as formidable a factor, depending on if they've bought their house and they paid off their
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.540]   mortgage, et cetera.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:11.420]   Retiree taxes in some places in California, for example, there's a limit on how much they
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.200]   can be increased once you bought the house, et cetera.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.820]   My inflation may be different than your inflation.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:24.660]   There's some research by David Blanchett that talks about the spending smile of retirees,
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.740]   showing how retiree spending might not actually keep up with inflation.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.860]   I will link to that in the show notes for our podcast listeners.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:41.060]   David Blanchett, by the way, was our guest on episode 14 of the Bogleheads Live show.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.220]   I'll also link to that in the show notes.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.660]   Let's talk more about measuring risk.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:53.940]   This question is from the White Coat Investor from the Bogleheads forums, who writes, "Risk
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:01.180]   adjusted return calculators, such as the Sharpe ratio, use volatility as a measurement risk.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.980]   Volatility is the change in price of your investment."
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.780]   The White Coat Investor goes on to say, "A long-term investor really shouldn't care much
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.660]   about volatility.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.700]   Does that mean that they shouldn't care about the Sharpe, Treynor, or Sortino ratios?"
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.580]   And before we answer that question, perhaps you can tell us what those ratios are.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.280]   I can probably answer that part, what the Sharpe ratio is.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.620]   And let me say, by the way, I didn't call it that.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.420]   I called it the reward to variability ratio, and I think it was Gene Fama started calling
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.060]   it the Sharpe ratio.
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:43.540]   The idea of the Sharpe ratio is to at least take two things into account, you know, an
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.100]   average returns and a standard deviation.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:55.160]   Standard deviation, for those who aren't investing nerds, is just a way that we can measure risk.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.360]   How much our portfolio changes in value.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.480]   This is the same thing as the volatility that we just mentioned.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.760]   Standard deviation, volatility, and risk are often all used interchangeably.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:16.520]   The T statistic or the Sharpe ratio, it gives you credit for higher average returns.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.780]   That's on the top and it gives you a discredit or demotes your number or lowers your number
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.520]   for more risk, more variation.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.460]   That's the number on the bottom.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:33.000]   And so this has in the numerator an average and on the denominator a standard deviation.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.940]   So you get a better number if you do better on average and you get a better number of
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.880]   the things equal if you have less variability.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:48.400]   It's not unlike a statistical measure called the T statistic, which again is saying, well,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.240]   here's how you did on average, but how much variation was there?
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.660]   If you did this on average and it was almost the same every single period, then using that
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.820]   number as a prediction makes me more comfortable than if it was that on average, but it was
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.180]   very all over the place.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.780]   The original idea, as you know, it takes into account the risk-free rate.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.540]   So it's not just the average return on the top.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.500]   It's average over and above the risk-free rate.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.660]   That's because it assumes that you can borrow and lend at that rate.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:26.060]   And so you could take that portfolio and lever it up or down at that rate.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.180]   That's the economics behind it.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.900]   The Sharpe ratio, it's a useful number.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.520]   I would not refuse to look at it if somebody offered it to me for an investment.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:42.960]   And again, it's particularly important to understand that for a piece of a portfolio,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.080]   the risk of that piece may or may not be important depending on how correlated it is with what's
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   going on with the other securities in the portfolio.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.440]   I sometimes say when people ask about the Sharpe ratio, they say, look, folks, we have
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.500]   computers now.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.620]   We don't need to put everything in one number.
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.040]   We can look at more than one number, you know, what was the average return and what was the
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.540]   risk and what was the beta, et cetera.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.220]   We can do things that are more sophisticated.
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.900]   I serve on nonprofit investment committees.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:21.560]   Very often the consultant or the manager will show you Sharpe ratios for every investment
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.220]   in the portfolio, this fund, that fund, et cetera.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.660]   That doesn't really help you much with what it was originally intended for.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.140]   It does help you in the sense it's like a T statistic.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.420]   It is interesting if a manager did not only well, but did it with quite some consistency.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.860]   You have more reason to believe that you'll might get some good results in the future.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:50.420]   Like some manager who is touting a Sharpe ratio, I don't know, it was five or something,
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.260]   you know, this humongous Sharpe ratio and looked at it and said, it was based on, I
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:04.740]   think it was 14 monthly returns for private equity for which there was no market value.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.300]   It was just an estimate.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.900]   And they'd put down these 15 estimates and sure enough, there wasn't much variation and
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.440]   they've done all right, according to the estimates.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.580]   So sometimes there are uses that I would not endorse.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:23.220]   For those folks who aren't investment nerds, why that is hilarious for two reasons.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.660]   Number one, a 14 month investment return is pretty much random.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.720]   And then also if it's a private investment, the manager can pretty much make up whatever
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.380]   price, whatever investment return.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.380]   What do you want?
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.340]   What would you like it to be worth?
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:43.460]   All that's to say how they use the Sharpe ratio in that situation is quite silly.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.540]   And then for me, the Sharpe ratio is very special because I looked at how endowments
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.900]   did next to index fund portfolios for a master's thesis.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.140]   Hey, what happens with $600 million to invest?
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:00.620]   Well, the data already exists to show that those endowments would have been better off
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.520]   with low cost index funds.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.880]   But what about risk?
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.140]   What is the risk adjusted return?
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.720]   So I use a Sharpe ratio and the Sortino ratio to show even on a risk adjusted basis, considering
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.860]   how much risk you are taking, that the amount of return you're getting compared to that
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.580]   index fund portfolio is not that great.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.380]   And of course, if you're comparing portfolios and you can borrow and lend at the riskless
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:31.920]   rate, then the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio is golden because with leverage
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.580]   up or down, that can beat anything below it.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.620]   Let's jump to the second part of the White Coat Investors question who asks, "How can
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:48.020]   we adjust for the deep risks discussed by Dr. Bill Bernstein, such as inflation, deflation,
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.780]   confiscation, and devastation?"
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.060]   Let me maybe twist the question a little to a broader question, to what extent is it useful
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:05.500]   to look at historic returns on a security portfolio, the market, whatever, as a predictor
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.220]   of future returns and risks?
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.060]   And that's a very serious question you have to ask yourself.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:21.960]   I would say, I think it's incumbent upon you or your advisor to look at history to see
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.520]   how that particular portfolio would have done in the past.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.640]   I don't think you should say past is not a predictor of the future, so don't look at
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.140]   all.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:39.120]   On the other hand, if a portfolio did well in the past, how likely is it that it's going
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.980]   to do well in the future?
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.340]   And I would say generally not very likely.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.160]   Risk is a somewhat different matter.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.700]   Past risk is probably a better predictor of future risk.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:57.120]   In an efficient market, past expected returns that are abnormally high are unlikely to be
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.440]   repeated as are terrible returns.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.400]   If it's done really well in the past, the market knows that, and the price reflects
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.060]   that to the extent that it's predictive of the future.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:16.860]   So don't expect, with any kind of certainty, abnormally high returns in the future.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:22.780]   Let's talk a little bit more about the risk-adjusted metrics that are out there.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:28.320]   Username Chiggy from Twitter writes, "I should ask him if the Sharpe Ratio is the best risk-adjusted
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.620]   return metric to compare index funds versus mutual funds."
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.700]   In principle, the Sharpe Ratio should be used for your whole portfolio.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.880]   In many cases, it's used for pieces of the portfolio.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.140]   It's useful, but in a different sense.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:49.320]   And if you're using it for pieces of a portfolio, then it's more in the sense of the T-statistic.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:56.300]   How did that piece do on average, and how much risk variation was there getting to that
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   average?
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.820]   If you got that average return almost every single month, then that's a very different
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.660]   story than if you got it ranging all over the place.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.300]   For a whole portfolio, don't just use the standard deviation.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.120]   Look at the whole distribution.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:20.280]   How many months, let's say, over the last 20 years, did it lose 20%, did it lose 19%?
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.340]   Show the range of things that happened and how frequently they happened.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.100]   That's for the whole portfolio.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:32.340]   For pieces of the portfolio, even standard deviation, the typical risk measure, standard
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:39.980]   deviation of a portfolio of X plus Y is not just the average of those two standard deviations.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.140]   It depends on how they move together, so it gets more complicated.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.100]   Thoughts on the Sortino ratio?
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:55.420]   My recollection is that for the Sortino ratio, for the risk side, uses downside risk on the
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.940]   grounds that the risk of that you'll do better than expected doesn't seem to be something
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.340]   you should worry about.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.340]   And Sortino is certainly right.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.700]   When you're looking at a whole portfolio, what you care about is downside.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.860]   Outside risk is fine, you know, the more the merrier.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.380]   And there's the issue, if the distribution is symmetric around a middle point, you know,
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.440]   when you plot it, it looks sort of the same on the downside as on the upside, then it
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.580]   kind of doesn't matter whether you use standard deviation or the standard deviation of the
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.580]   downside.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.620]   Bill, I mentioned earlier that I used the Sharpe ratio to compare index fund portfolios
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:39.420]   to the very high fee portfolios of endowments to compare their performance on a risk-adjusted
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.420]   basis.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:45.300]   I also used the Sortino ratio and the results were very similar.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.460]   That's kind of my expectation.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.020]   The probability distributions aren't symmetric, but they're typically of a similar enough
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.020]   form.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.500]   Probably if you rank on one, probably rank on the other.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:04.300]   This question is from username Derrick Tinnin from Twitter, who writes, "Are the persistent
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.260]   flows to index funds changing the market structure?"
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.780]   I guess there are two ways of looking at that question.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.380]   One is, were there not those funds, how different would things be?
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.780]   The other is, given there are those now and there were not back in my early days, how
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.220]   different are things, and I'll skip the latter one because the world is so different
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.220]   in general.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.700]   I don't even know how to start on that one.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:37.780]   I guess one difference if people generally stop using index funds would be they'd be
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.900]   poorer because they'd be paying higher fees.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:47.700]   And as Jack Vogel has wrote about and talked about many times, that's not a trivial difference.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.680]   That's a major difference.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:56.160]   Some of the ironies of efficient market theory broadly construed is there's a sort of a contradiction.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.960]   We assume that people are really working hard to figure out exactly how much more General
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:08.240]   Motors is worth than General Electric, and that all those prices take into account information
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.140]   in very efficient ways.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:18.660]   And yet we encourage investors to pay no attention to any of that and just call them all.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.840]   And there has to be a point at which there aren't enough active managers, people doing
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:30.600]   research on securities to keep the market prices right, as it were, to incorporate the
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.100]   information that's extant into security prices.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.820]   That's a really interesting thing to worry about.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:43.760]   And over the many years since we all started in this field, question is how much indexing
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.560]   is too much?
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:51.080]   My hope at least is that if and when we got to that point, enough people will peel off
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:56.000]   and start doing security research and become active managers.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.280]   Where that point is, I don't know, but it is a dilemma.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.320]   So you don't want to convince too many people to index.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:11.020]   Unfortunately, the people who don't index are paying the price for that research through
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.380]   higher fees.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.780]   It's a very strange kind of equilibrium.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.740]   Do I worry about it now?
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.740]   No.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.880]   Do I index now?
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   Yes.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:27.380]   When I started teaching the investments course at Stanford, and this would have been 1970
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.120]   or thereafter, I would start the course by going into the classroom and writing on the
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.000]   board a phone number.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.120]   And I would say, this is the most important information you're going to get in this course.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.960]   And I'd wait for somebody to say, well, what is that?
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.560]   And I said, that's the new customer line at Vanguard.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.560]   This is true.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.320]   And I'm making this up just to please the Bogleheads because they were at that time
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.300]   the only place you could get an index fund.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:00.680]   It's an issue to think about, if not worry about, is there too much indexing?
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.920]   The answer is no, but I can't prove it.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.600]   Certainly to your point, if too many index fund investors means an opportunity to make
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.640]   some money, someone's going to try and do just that.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   Of course.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.200]   And the question is, how much, if any of that, will the managers pass through to the shareholders
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.760]   of the fund?
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.200]   To quote Rick Ferry, if there is any alpha, it goes to the managers.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.940]   Let's move on to another question on index investing.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:34.840]   This one is from username SB1234 from the Bogleheads forums who writes, are buy and
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.920]   hold index fund investors free riding in the sense that they do not contribute to price
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   discovery?
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.000]   I think so.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.480]   There are certainly managers who get rich by being in some sense superior in getting
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.760]   information and acting on it.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:58.600]   I have a general audience teaching the investments course at Stanford and I will divide them
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.160]   into two halves, left side of the room, right side.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   They're all money managers in this market and they collectively are the market.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.480]   I would assign half of them to be index fund managers and tell them what they did.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.280]   They had to figure out how many shares were outstanding of each and by exactly proportional
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.720]   amounts and the people on this side were active managers and I would describe this one does
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.060]   research on this and that one does this and, you know, give them a sense of what active
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.680]   managers do.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.120]   So I'd say these folks own half the market and those folks collectively own half the
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.760]   market and the index managers, of course, each of them owns the same portfolio, but
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.560]   the active managers are all over the place.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.720]   And then I would say, okay, before costs, the market is down 12%, okay, before costs,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:56.040]   what did this passive manager earn and they've said 12%, what did that one earn, yeah, 12%.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.120]   Now over here on the active side, what did this one earn, 30%, brilliant, what did this
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:07.240]   one earn, minus 12, what did the average dollar earn on the passive side before costs and
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.720]   they think a bit, 12%.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.440]   What did the average dollar earn on the active side, it takes a little while, it gotta be
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.440]   12%.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   Okay.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.420]   Then we take costs into account.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:25.400]   In general audiences, when you play that little game, they say, wait a minute, what did he
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   do?
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   Wait, that can't be right.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:34.480]   I mean, forget datas and standard deviations and equilibrium and all that, just that argument
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.520]   from pure arithmetic.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.680]   And the money managers hate to hear that because they don't want to have to have that discussion
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   with their clients.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:48.600]   It's a paper, I published a two-page paper on the arithmetic of active management.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.680]   Sharpe's math, I'll link to that in the show notes for our podcast listeners, they can
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.880]   check out that paper by Bill.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.900]   There have been attempts by many managers writing articles to say, well, but there are
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.900]   new issues.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.400]   We get them, the good ones first, and there's this and there's that.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.040]   Those are minor perturbations, realistically.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.680]   And that argument for indexing, I mean, it's so self-evident, virtually everybody in the
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.360]   Boglehead group knows it.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.500]   Let's move on to some questions on model portfolios next.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:25.640]   This one is from username Exodusing from the Bogleheads forums who writes, a general principle
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.200]   is that people who are much different from the average investor, as weighted by portfolio
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.640]   size or trading activity, those people should deviate from the market cap weighting to take
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.300]   into account their special differences.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.460]   Does Bill agree?
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.400]   And then we had a similar question from username Tom76.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.440]   Let me break that into two pieces.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.760]   One is less risk, more risk.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.120]   And in the theory, you can do that by borrowing and lending.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.460]   And in the theory, you can borrow and lend at the same rate, but those are very strong
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.460]   assumptions.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.720]   There's one market portfolio levered up or down.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.020]   And of course, people don't just take one market portfolio and lever it up or down.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:15.240]   They tend to shade a bias towards less risky funds for a bias towards more risky, et cetera.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:21.660]   The real world is more complicated than the simple models that economists create.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:27.780]   People cannot borrow at the same rate at which they can lend or risklessly invest.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:33.900]   There are arguments there and I will not argue that life is as simple as in our simple models.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.100]   And again, you need to take your whole portfolio into account, your assets.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.480]   If you have a home, an occupied home, that's an asset.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.960]   If you have a mortgage, that's a liability, et cetera.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:51.560]   I sort of think of that as more a bond stock issue.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:57.660]   Now in the simple theory, you know, there's the market portfolio includes bonds and stocks
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.120]   and you lever that up or down at the riskless rate.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.040]   Well, let's face it, we really don't do that.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:09.520]   I think a lot of those issues can be addressed by changing the proportions of bonds and stocks.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:16.480]   And that I think is the lever that I would prefer to see people pulling and pushing to
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   get a balance.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.560]   And that goes back to that basic Boglet's principle, which is take the right amount
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.780]   of risk.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.160]   And you can do that by adjusting that lever.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.480]   How much do you want in bonds versus stocks?
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.280]   Yeah, that would certainly be the place to start at the very least.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.160]   I wonder if Exodus is asking about factor investing in this question.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.960]   Some people's favorite strategy of overweighting small stocks, for example, you can do that
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.600]   with index funds.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.340]   I don't advocate overweighting small stocks because you think they're underpriced.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.940]   More risk for the chance at higher return.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:59.360]   Those higher returns are not guaranteed when overweighting small caps.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.640]   Let's talk about TIPS, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.760]   These are inflation-adjusted government bonds.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.080]   We have another question from Boglet's forums.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:15.120]   This user writes, "Now that TIPS have positive real yields, should individual investors who
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.840]   have enough space in tax-deferred accounts be using them exclusively instead of regular
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.240]   or nominal treasury bonds?"
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   It's certainly nicer now that they have positive.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.360]   It's not so nice for those who help them if they need to sell them.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.200]   Well, definitely in an important sense, TIPS for somebody in the U.S. are the riskless
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:40.320]   security or as riskless as you can get in terms of consumption.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.980]   Let's return to a question that we touched on earlier on factor investing, such as those
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.400]   factors found by Fama and French.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.040]   Do you believe in those factors?
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.000]   Well, believe is perhaps too strong a word.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Are they useful?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.960]   Yes, for some things they are.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:04.720]   But do I believe that it is clearly true that people should overweight exposure to a small
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.600]   factor or a gross factor or whatever factor of your choice because there's something wrong
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.400]   with the markets?
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.640]   No.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.460]   What are your thoughts on international diversification?
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.320]   Should investors be only investing in the U.S. total stock market or should we be investing
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   globally?
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.220]   I'll have to tell a story here.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:35.760]   I was on a nonprofit investment committee and one of the members was a semi-retired
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.720]   private equity guy.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:45.020]   And we had a consultant who was helping us, et cetera, the usual story.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:51.680]   And at one point we were discussing a foreign investment and he gave a little speech as
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.080]   far as I could tell was not kidding, said, well, if he had his druthers, we wouldn't
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.500]   have any foreign investments because they don't know how to run businesses over there.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.720]   And I thought, well, surely, okay, haha, this is a joke.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   It wasn't.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.460]   He was serious.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.460]   That's one view.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.660]   It's not mine.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:16.860]   My view is that international diversification should be a good thing in theory as long as
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:24.420]   people can without too many problems in terms of repatriation and all the rest and divergent
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.260]   tax systems.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:33.220]   I believe in globally diversified portfolios, there is a sense of diversification.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:41.380]   That said, there is an argument for investing at least more than market proportions at home
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:47.180]   because that's where a lot of your consumption originates.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.940]   You know, if in fact the company that you have traditionally purchased goods at the
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:57.300]   grocery store does very well because they raise their prices a lot, you at least have
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   a balance.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:04.580]   Well, I'm paying more, but my stock went up and that's a trivial and sort of a silly example.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:11.140]   So I think there is an argument for home bias, but I don't think it's totally offset by the
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.860]   advantages of global diversification.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.860]   So there's a happy point in the middle somewhere there.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:24.340]   For those who aren't investment nerds, know that the global cap weighting is roughly 60/40.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:29.980]   That's to say roughly 60 cents of every dollar invested around the world is invested in U.S.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:34.380]   companies and the balance of that 40 cents is invested outside of the U.S.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.780]   So that is the global cap weighting.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:42.260]   If we have a home bias, we'll invest a little bit more than that roughly 60% compared to
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.740]   international.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:49.460]   For example, Rick Ferry, the normal host of this podcast, frequently suggests 2/3, 1/3
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.780]   in favor of U.S. stock markets, giving us a little bit of a home bias.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.380]   He talks about that in episode one of the Bogleheads Live podcast.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.180]   I'll link to that in the show notes for our podcast listeners to check that out.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:07.180]   Bill, what do you think is a reasonable mix for home bias?
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:13.900]   Whether or not you go to world market proportions, which is what I would favor as a default.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:20.060]   Ask yourself, I don't buy only companies in California, I buy companies in the U.S. and
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.660]   I don't buy only companies in the U.S.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.580]   I think you need to really think a little bit about what are your other holdings.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.360]   You obviously have a disproportionate holding in the U.S. if you own your own home.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:38.700]   So if you take your overall portfolio, including things like equity in your home, then that
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.140]   gives you a difference.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.860]   Certainly if you've got real estate, your primary residence, maybe even some investment
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:51.380]   properties, then that further tilts you towards that home bias.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.060]   Then if you've got that global cap weighted portfolio for your liquid investments, that
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.660]   is a phenomenal point.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.740]   There was a time there was some investor would say, I only invest in things that are close
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.740]   to home.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.980]   You think, no, wait a minute, that's from a diversification standpoint, you win a lot
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:12.500]   of stake in California or if what have you from your property.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.900]   Let's talk more about bonds.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.500]   Bill, I'm curious about your thoughts on the following.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:22.140]   The risk of equities shows up in corporate bonds, therefore, if I'm trying to manage
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:29.460]   equity risk, I don't want to hold bonds that are subject to equity risk in my portfolio.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.620]   That means opting exclusively for U.S.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:38.820]   Government bonds for the bond portion of my portfolio as advocated by David Swenson, the
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.140]   late chief investment officer over at Yields Endowment.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.700]   I haven't thought of the issue that way.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:51.820]   Why should it matter in what manner you invest in the company?
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.820]   It's out there.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.660]   It's part of the market, broadly construed.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.420]   There is obviously the risk issue.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.460]   If you take the simplest of a theory, in theory, you should deal with combining the overall
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:11.420]   market with riskless securities to deal with your risk aversion and you should get everything
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:16.260]   that's out there in the market, if you can get it at reasonable expense.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:22.700]   Now kinds of issues you're raising are more subtle, theory is not subtle enough to deal
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.700]   with it.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:29.460]   My first impression would be whatever the company's issued will buy our proportionate
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:38.380]   share of everything and then leverage to move the overall risk of the portfolio up or potentially
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.380]   down.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:45.940]   Barita Lover from the Bogleheads Forums asks, "Is chasing higher yields via a lower-duration
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.380]   bond in the current environment a viable strategy?"
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:55.500]   Well, I would just say generically anything that assumes that you can exploit somebody
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:01.180]   who is dumber than you would not be recommended if you believe in efficient markets.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:06.700]   What are your thoughts on changing bond maturity over time, that's to say right now short-term
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.900]   yields are really attractive, therefore I'm going to hold a short-term bond portfolio
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.940]   and then maybe when rates normalize, I'll update my bond portfolio going farther out
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.140]   on that yield curve.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:24.820]   What do you think about market timing your bond portfolio with respect to interest rates?
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:32.180]   Yeah, in general, I don't think much positively about market timing because market timing
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:37.900]   means the other people in the market are stupid or at least not as smart as you are.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.020]   And there are a lot of smart people in the market.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:46.940]   It's not at all clear that you know significantly more than is embedded in the market.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:47.940]   Maybe you do.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:52.380]   I think you know more about the future than the average investor and you have to think
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:58.340]   of the average investor as dollar-weighted, not the average investor, you know, down the
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.180]   street with a small portfolio.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.740]   The average investor is pretty informed and pretty smart.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.300]   If you're going to underweight or overweight anything because you think the market is quote
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:15.420]   got it wrong, then you're betting against a bunch of folks, many of whom in terms of
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.260]   dollars invested, know a lot about some of these things.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.820]   I do not play that game and I would not recommend it to the average investor.
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.240]   What are your thoughts on foreign bond holdings?
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.740]   This question is from user name McHugh from the Global Heads Forums who asks about just
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:38.740]   holding the U.S. bond market on the bond portion of their portfolio.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.300]   Well there's an argument you should overweigh that which you eat.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.740]   In other words, you live in the U.S., you buy things from the U.S. predominantly, although
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:54.940]   not exclusively of course, there would be an argument for doing things that are closer
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:01.820]   to your consumption basket, put it in economist terms, and I think that's an argument worth
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.820]   thinking about.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:09.960]   Of course, we consume a lot of things that in whole or in part come from elsewhere, but
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.220]   the whole bias, you know, maybe makes some sense, but you have to think about it that
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.780]   way I would argue as you make the decision.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.820]   Let's talk a bit more about real estate.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.560]   This question is from user name Abbas368 from the Bullguards Forums who writes, what are
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.100]   his thoughts on private real estate investing, such as Fundrise and Grant Cardone, as an
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:38.420]   alternative asset class to invest in alongside a diversified low-cost total market index
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.700]   fund portfolio?
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:47.940]   I think you should certainly get market proportion, think about market proportions of real estate
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:52.980]   in the sense of things that are traded on security markets where you've got liquidity,
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.580]   et cetera, not in the underlying asset, but in the security.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:03.820]   When you start talking about direct investment in real estate, that raises a number of other
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.820]   conditions.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.260]   I mean, you're not going to try to get a piece of every shopping mall.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.860]   I think it's a practical matter.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:18.980]   There are traded securities on major markets, that's definitely something worth considering
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.540]   in proportions on those markets.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:31.060]   Abbas368 goes on to say, these funds typically have high fees, such as 1% and are illiquid.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.020]   Does that illiquidity increase the probability of achieving alpha?
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.060]   Well, I would not argue that anything with certainty increases the probability of increasing
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.060]   alpha.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:46.860]   I think there's a pretty good argument that the truly average investor should consider
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.860]   liquidity.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.700]   You obviously don't do it when you buy your own house.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:56.420]   You buy real estate that's illiquid because you can live in it, but to buy on the illiquid
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:03.860]   asset as an investment, period, I think you should give some thought before you do that.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.980]   Let's talk about publicly traded REITs.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:13.220]   For example, using Vanguard's low-cost REIT index fund, V&Q, these were highly recommended
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:18.380]   10 to 20 years ago by Burton Malkiel and David Swensen.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.560]   I think you should consider investing in them in market proportions, in the risky part of
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   your portfolio.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:30.900]   Again, if they're highly liquid and they're traded reputably and such, yes.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:36.680]   When you invest in VTI, VTSAX, that low-cost Vanguard total stock market index fund, you're
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.840]   already getting everything in V&Q, to your point.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.540]   Let's pivot to annuities.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:47.300]   This one is from username Afan from the forums, who writes, "Can you discuss the role of
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.780]   annuities versus bonds in a retirement plan?"
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.600]   Annuities versus bonds, well, there's a really big difference.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.460]   When you die, your kids can tell there's a difference, or your universities, and that
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.980]   when you die and holding annuities, there's nothing for anyone else.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:10.780]   That's a major difference, and the whole issue of should you annuitize, should you partially
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.140]   annuitize is one that takes an awful lot of thought.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.140]   There are very, very important things that transcend investment discussions on whether
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.020]   you should annuitize or not.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.820]   One of the questions is whether or not you can even make it to a very old age, which
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.880]   you have some probability of reaching.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.180]   And do you want to play the probabilities, or just say, "I'm not going to bet that I'm
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.660]   going to die soon"?
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:42.300]   It's a very complicated decision that involves many issues that transcend or at least overwhelm
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.860]   the economics involved.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:51.100]   A single premium immediate annuity, that's the type of annuity you described just now.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:57.300]   Let's jump to some questions that you suggested about asking artificial intelligence, AI,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.900]   how to invest.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:42:59.900]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:05.820]   First of all, of course, as you well know, everybody now well knows the answers.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.580]   It's astounding what kind of answers you can get.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.580]   Answers do differ.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:18.060]   I asked the arithmetic of active management, "Can the average dollar invested in a market
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:25.540]   portfolio after costs outperform the average dollar invested in active strategies?"
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.320]   And one of them said, "No, period."
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:35.060]   One has to think about what the role of AI will be in investment advice, whether it will
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:41.620]   replace some humans or it will just give advice to people who otherwise didn't get it, and
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.120]   what the impact of that might be.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.820]   We need to find a way to make sure that the AI reads some of the things that you and I
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.860]   are talking about and such.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:55.740]   Certainly, at least for the short-term inspirer, be aware if you're using those AI platforms
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.540]   for investment advice.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.540]   Amen.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.060]   Bill, thank you so much for your time.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.020]   I really appreciate it, as I'm sure as do all the Bogleheads.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.380]   Any final thoughts you'd like to share with the Bogleheads?
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.140]   My guess is the Bogleheads are on pretty much the right course, if they're truly following
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   Jack.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.420]   That's a very good thing.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:20.340]   I appreciate your interest and I appreciate their interest and I appreciate anybody who
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:25.380]   listens to whatever the edited version of this will be for spending the time.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:29.860]   And that wraps up our interview with Dr. William Sharpe.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.260]   Don't forget, you've still got time to take advantage of the special room rate for the
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.220]   hotel for the 2023 Bogleheads conference.
