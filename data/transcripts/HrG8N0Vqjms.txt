[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   (sound of clock ticking)
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:19.080]   (music)
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.240]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.520]   Duncan, I would wish you a happy New Year, but I'm not a happy New Year kind of guy.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.960]   I don't do it. Nothing against people who do it, it's just not my thing. I don't say it.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.040]   Maybe this is kind of like my Larry David thing, but I'm just not a happy New Year kind of guy.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520]   No problem that people will say it, but that's just me. Kind of like investing.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.640]   It's just as important to define what you won't invest in as what you will invest in.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.240]   Today's show is sponsored by, yes, Liftoff Invest.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.960]   That's our automated platform that is run through Betterment's technology.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.760]   Duncan, I was looking at my Liftoff account.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.080]   I have one account, but I have four goals under there.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.600]   One of them is for me and my wife, just a general investment account.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.760]   The other one, each one for three of our kids.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.360]   I was looking, and surprisingly, the investments were down this year, but my market values were up.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.880]   Why? Because I increased my savings rate.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.960]   I think especially for young people, that's a really big thing these days.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.480]   Yes, it hurts to see the value of your portfolio go down, but if you bump up your savings rate,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.160]   especially when you're just starting out, that's where most of your gains are going to come from.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.800]   They're not technically gains, but if you want to see growth in your portfolio,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.680]   it's going to come from putting money to work.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.520]   Go check out LiftoffInvest.com to learn more.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.760]   Duncan, you told me that you finished my most recent book.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520]   It's a pretty short one. How many pages is that, 140?
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.880]   Let's see. I have it right here.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.560]   It's like 116 pages.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.560]   It's a short book, everything you need to know about saving for retirement.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.120]   I wrote it for people with 401(k)s or 403(b)s who are just getting started.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.320]   Maybe some of our clients' kids have read it, some people in our 401(k) plans.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.880]   You told me that you finished reading and had some questions or had some thoughts.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.320]   Yeah, I've had a lot of thoughts.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.720]   I was like, "I wish I did a podcast with Ben because then I could ask him these questions."
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.560]   And then, yeah, it worked out.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.520]   First of all, I just wanted to say, on behalf of a lot,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.400]   we had a lot of people writing in and commenting,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.920]   "We're all sorry for you getting so robbed of your take."
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.600]   Michael took your Bezos take and just got famous off of it.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.160]   It was on TV yesterday, talking about it and stuff.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.320]   He's going to be the new Michael Burry because he leased one of my takes
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.840]   about Jeff Bezos coming back to take over Amazon.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.240]   That's the kind of podcast co-host and friend that I am.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.680]   I'm willing to give my takes away to other people.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.120]   I have too many of them.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   Very generous, very generous.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   But yeah, so a couple of things I just thought of that I noted down
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.840]   that I wanted to ask you about.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.200]   They're very basic probably, but I think people would be curious to hear,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080]   or a lot of our younger people especially.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.920]   But so, you're known as the target date guy.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.760]   You're a target date expert, connoisseur.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.400]   What happens to them when they hit their date?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.960]   I mean, do they just go 100% bonds and stay that way forever?
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.120]   Does it just disappear into the ether?
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.640]   What happens there?
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.520]   Well, I looked at the Vanguard 2020 fund today.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.600]   So, someone would have set that 10, 15 years ago and said,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.720]   "I'm going to retire in 2020.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.680]   This is going to be my glide path to that point."
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.760]   It's in roughly 45% stocks, 55% bonds right now.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.240]   So, your investing lifecycle doesn't stop just the moment you retire.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.680]   You still could have two, three decades.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.840]   It just moves into a different phase.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.360]   We actually have a question about this for today's show,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.640]   which we'll get into more detail.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.840]   So, yeah, it just gets more conservative over time.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.080]   But yeah, still some stocks in there
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.760]   because you still need some growth in your portfolio.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.120]   Okay. So, they don't end or anything like that or go away?
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.720]   No, it keeps going and it keeps going the glide path.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.800]   It'll probably get more and more conservative
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.920]   the further you get away from that date,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.080]   but there's still some stocks in there.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.720]   Okay, cool. Good to know.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.280]   Okay, another thing I was going to ask,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.680]   you talk a lot about having to,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.200]   you know, a huge part of the book is withstanding volatility,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.480]   withstanding downturns in the market and just sticking with it.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.520]   Have computers and algorithms and modern technology
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.000]   and retail traders, all of the stuff that we think about
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.520]   when we think about the market today,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.720]   have they made the market less volatile
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.320]   and susceptible to downturns or more
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.120]   or not really impacted it?
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.840]   Overall volatility, like if you measured by standard deviation,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.000]   is probably pretty similar, like annualizing that number.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.040]   But the speed of the volatility has increased.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.920]   I remember there was an interview with a guy
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.520]   who was a fixed income manager for Vanguard
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.720]   and he was retiring.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.960]   And he said he started in the early '80s.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.640]   And he said back in like 1981, when a news event occurred,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.160]   you had time to actually sit and think about it.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.240]   If something happened overseas,
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   it might not affect the US market until like the next day.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.640]   Now everything is instantaneous.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   Like you don't have time to think through these things.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.240]   So I think the speed of volatility has certainly increased.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   Computers and stuff makes, you know,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.600]   if there's a piece of news or economic data that hits,
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.960]   it immediately hits the stock market.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.280]   I don't think that was the case in the past.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.320]   You would have to get some of your news from the market
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.880]   over the radio back in the day
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.560]   instead of seeing it in real time.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.640]   So I think the overall volatility
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.360]   is probably pretty similar,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.080]   but the speed of the volatility and the speed of the moves
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.760]   is probably much faster.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.600]   Okay.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.440]   And I think that's probably gonna continue.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.280]   Yeah, I was wondering because the behavioral aspect
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.400]   you would think would be getting better
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.160]   with all the automation and stuff like that.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.800]   So in my head, I was thinking like,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.600]   I wonder if that has made the market a little more stable.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.440]   Well, on the other hand,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.400]   it's never been easier to pay attention
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.240]   than ever before, right?
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.080]   Right.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.040]   To have that long-term mindset
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.400]   'cause you're being force-fed everything in the short term
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.240]   over and over again.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.840]   It's harder to think and act for the long-term
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.680]   because you can see everything happen
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.600]   on a minute-by-minute basis.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.680]   True, true.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.200]   So along kind of a similar thread,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.400]   one of my favorite stats in there
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.160]   was nearly 29,000 companies traded on the US stock market
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.040]   from 1950 to 2009.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.400]   Almost 80% were gone by 2009.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.440]   So my question for you is,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.040]   do you think that we'll lose 80% of companies
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.280]   over the next 59 years?
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.560]   Or has that changed?
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.240]   Is the business world more resilient now?
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.680]   I don't know if your oat milk company
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.640]   is still gonna be in business by then.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.080]   And so I think I got the stats from "Scale" by Jeffrey West,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.520]   which is a really good book.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I actually think technology's
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.040]   only gonna speed this up.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.080]   Companies of old required way more upfront investment
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   in actual physical assets.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.360]   Michael had a good one.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.200]   I'm gonna steal this from him.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   He said like the first billion-dollar corporation ever
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.120]   was US Steel in 1901.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.680]   And they had 170,000 employees
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   and like $3,300 in sales per employee, right?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.800]   And that's still like 90,000 in today's dollars.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.240]   But today they have over 500,000 per employee
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.480]   because they've gotten more efficient.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.560]   Technology has gotten better.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.640]   Software makes it easier than ever to start businesses.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.320]   I just think, I look at this as a good thing too.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.400]   I think it's creative destruction
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.720]   where the quicker these old companies are being pushed out
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.880]   and the new companies are coming in,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.920]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.760]   And the one great thing about owning a diverse set
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.440]   of companies in the stock market is
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.960]   eventually those ones that rise to the top
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   are gonna show up in your portfolio.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.920]   I think the first trillion-dollar company,
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.200]   it's possible it hasn't even been created yet.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.360]   And it's gonna be created in the future
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   to solve some big problem that we don't even know yet.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.200]   - All right.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.040]   - So I think this is a good thing.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.640]   - That makes sense.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.920]   All right, so last but not least out of these,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.880]   I just wrote down, what's a simple way
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.160]   for a young person to assess their risk tolerance?
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.440]   You talk a lot about risk tolerance
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.600]   and knowing your risk and different phases of life.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.560]   How does someone figure it out?
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.600]   - One of the hardest things to do,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.560]   it's probably the only thing you can do
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.920]   is have experience.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.120]   I know people say, "Oh, put together a paper portfolio.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.360]   "Pretend like you're trading, you've no money."
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.240]   Unfortunately, it's difficult to say how you'll react
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.480]   until you actually do it with someone,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.120]   see your life savings get chopped in half.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.360]   One of my favorite books of all time is this,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.320]   "Where Are the Customers?" by Fred Schwed.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.760]   It's, I think it was written in the 1930s or 1940s.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.120]   He had this great quote that I use all the time.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.260]   He said, "Like all of life's rich emotional experiences,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.520]   "the full flavor of losing important money
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.260]   "cannot be conveyed by literature.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.280]   "There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.040]   "to a virgin either by words or pictures."
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.680]   And so I think sometimes you have to just live through it
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.320]   and see, I can keep 100% of my portfolio in stocks.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.160]   I think I can.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.640]   I have a high risk tolerance.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.680]   But until you actually do it
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.480]   and go through something like last year
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.160]   and see that money fall,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.620]   I think you have to kind of play it by ear and experience it.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.280]   And the good thing about if you're a young person investing
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.920]   is that you probably aren't gonna have
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.080]   a huge amount of capital
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.560]   when you're learning these things, right?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.160]   So you learn and make your mistakes
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.640]   or you kind of change the dial a little bit
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.600]   when you are young.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.440]   - Right.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.640]   And you write about this some, right?
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.960]   That a 50% loss when you have a couple thousand
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.480]   in the market starting out
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.840]   isn't nearly as bad as 50% loss
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.560]   when you have a much larger portfolio.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.960]   - Yeah, or 20% loss could be more painful
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.800]   if you have more money
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.200]   'cause it's more dollars going out of your account
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.440]   than even getting chopped in half
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.320]   when you don't have as much money.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   - Right, right.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.520]   - Good plug for my book there, Duncan.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.360]   Way to go.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.760]   - Yeah, and I had one quote I wanted to share
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.640]   with people that I think, especially again,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.200]   for everyone, but especially our younger
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.840]   and new investors.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.800]   You say, or you have in there,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.080]   your actions during down markets
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.000]   have a larger say in your success or failure as an investor
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.880]   than how you act during rising markets.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.600]   So I think that's a good thing for everyone
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.080]   to acknowledge right now.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.680]   - Giving up on an investment plan
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.840]   is no different than failure, right?
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.340]   Because if you give up and you just throw your arms up
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.560]   and you sell when things are down
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.760]   just because you can't take it anymore,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.080]   that giving up on your plan is no plan at all
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.040]   is my way of looking at it.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.440]   - Yeah, I like that.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280]   Cool, yeah.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.360]   So strong recommendation, I enjoyed it.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.160]   And I've been soaking in all the knowledge
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.960]   from all of you guys for years now
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.440]   and I still learned some stuff
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.240]   and still got a lot out of it, so yeah.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   - Perfect, all right, let's get into a question.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.600]   - Okay.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.520]   So first up today, we have 2022 was all about inflation.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.400]   Now people are talking about peak inflation
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.920]   and possible deflation.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.320]   What does deflation look like?
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.280]   Why do people say it's worse than inflation?
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.560]   Also, why do they say tech is deflationary?
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.120]   - All right, it does appear inflation is peaked
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.960]   for the time being.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.400]   John, throw up the chart here.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.080]   You can see if I'm performing technical analysis on this,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.800]   I can see a line and a peak and a line down.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.160]   That has to mean something.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.360]   It is important to remind people though
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.560]   that we have had inflation before these past 20 months
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.800]   or so of rapidly rising inflation.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.720]   Even before the current bout of high inflation,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.680]   prices were still rising.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   They were doing so at a much more modest pace.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.400]   So John, throw this other chart on.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.840]   This is CPI from 2010 to 2020.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.680]   It was modest.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.600]   It was up like 21% in total, a little less than 2% a year.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   We still had inflation.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.320]   No one just, people didn't really pay attention
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.280]   that much to it because it was a relatively
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.640]   stable increase over time.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.960]   There weren't any huge jumps or falls.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.800]   I guess you could call that price stability.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.720]   I don't know if we're gonna go
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.560]   from inflation to deflation.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.680]   It is a possibility if we get a nasty recession
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.520]   and things slow down considerably.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.240]   To the point about inflation versus deflation,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.280]   why wouldn't you want deflation, right?
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.840]   It's prices falling.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.680]   Who wouldn't want that?
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.760]   Well, the economy for one
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.560]   and probably your paycheck for another.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.080]   My view is not necessarily that inflation is good.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.400]   It's just that it's less bad than deflation.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.040]   Deflation is like this negative,
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.360]   crazy negative feedback loop.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.640]   So prices start to fall because people,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.320]   so people stop buying today in hopes
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.880]   that they'll be able to buy stuff cheaper in the future.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.200]   And so people stop buying stuff today.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.280]   Business profits go down.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.660]   People are laid off.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.040]   People get unemployed.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.480]   As unemployment rate rises, people's paychecks fall.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.420]   You know, it's like a death spiral of future price cuts.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.280]   That's why there was huge deflation
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.440]   in the Great Depression.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.240]   And trust me, people seeing their prices falling
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.720]   was not a good thing because that happened
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.680]   because there was 25% unemployment.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.320]   I think prices fell like 10% across the board
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.800]   in the US economy.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.440]   So I think if we want our incomes
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   and standard of living to rise,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.840]   we're gonna have to accept some price inflation over time
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.360]   because that's just progress.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.540]   It's a natural by-product of growth.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.600]   And so we're probably always gonna have
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.760]   a little bit of inflation over the long term,
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.000]   assuming we're still advancing as a species.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.040]   So I look at rising prices as the lesser of two evils.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.260]   People don't really like that,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.840]   but if you wanna continue to see growth and progress
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.080]   in our economy, you're gonna have to accept some inflation.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.560]   What we've seen this past year, year and a half
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.500]   is not normal, not what we'd like,
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.560]   but even if inflation goes down from here,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.400]   it's still gonna be, prices are still gonna be rising,
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.220]   just not at as much of a high pace.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.560]   - Okay, yeah, I'm most familiar with it
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.000]   because Kathy Wood seems to talk a lot
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.720]   about deflationary forces in tech, right?
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.560]   I think that's where a lot of people-
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.100]   - So I mean, people think it's a risk
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.920]   because that would probably mean a nasty recession.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.840]   And so I think if you gave me the choice of inflation,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.820]   but it's with economic growth and people's wages are rising
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.580]   versus deflation and people are losing their jobs
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.080]   and it's a recession, I'd probably take the lesser
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.940]   of two evils and have that inflation.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.840]   - Right, yeah.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.120]   - It's 'cause I'm one of the people.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.820]   - AI is gonna change this, right?
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.640]   AI, Ben and Duncan will be doing this show
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.960]   in a couple of years, edited by-
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.080]   - Well, people ask, he asked why is technology deflationary
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.140]   and it's because it just makes us more efficient, right?
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.160]   And back in the 1800s, 80% of us were farmers.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.920]   Now, I don't know, I think the percentage of people
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.760]   that work on farms is like 1%.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.560]   It's 'cause we have technology that's available
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.200]   to make it easier so people can do other jobs.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.720]   People have the ability to complain on the internet all day
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.600]   because technology has made our lives easier.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.360]   - That's all right.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.960]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.880]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.160]   - That question was from Yajur, by the way.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.020]   And so next we have a question from Chuck.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.180]   "Do you think the stock market is a form of Ponzi scheme?"
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.980]   And I gotta be honest, this question, I think,
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.820]   triggered me a little bit.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.820]   I'm sure it triggered you a little bit,
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.880]   but we love you, Chuck, but yeah.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.380]   "Do you think the stock market is a form of Ponzi scheme?
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.980]   "The average dividend payout for all stocks
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.400]   "is a little over 1%.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.300]   "Back in 1958, the average lifespan
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.240]   "of a corporation was 58 years,
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.160]   "but it's now down to around 15 years.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.060]   "So why are people investing in the stock market?
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.360]   "The answer is they hope to make money
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.080]   "from selling a piece of paper to someone else,
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.360]   "the greater fool, at a nice profit.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.180]   "If there's no one there to buy your piece of paper,
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.180]   "you won't make money in the long run."
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.020]   Okay.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.660]   - Listen, if Charles Ponzi's scheme
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.980]   did what the stock market does,
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.520]   it wouldn't be used as a way to talk down on someone
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.580]   for doing fraud.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.680]   It would be a good thing.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.520]   So the short answer is no,
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.100]   I don't think the stock market is a form of Ponzi scheme.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.420]   In Ponzi scheme, old investors are paid off
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.820]   by new investors, investors in quotes,
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.780]   because there's no business plan, there's no revenues.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.780]   Right, the stock market is made up of corporations,
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.260]   and those corporations make products,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.780]   they perform services.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.940]   Consumers and other businesses
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.380]   buy those products and services.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.540]   That results in revenue.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.000]   Some of that revenue is used to pay costs
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.840]   of running the business,
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.300]   but whatever's left over is used to pay down debt
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.180]   or buy back shares or pay dividends out to stock investors,
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.020]   or be reinvested back in the business.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.300]   So the profits of the business
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.940]   actually accrue to the shareholders, right?
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.900]   They have a piece of that profit.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.860]   And so as sales and dividends and earnings grow over time,
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.860]   stocks are worth more money.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.100]   It is true that dividend yields are lower
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.940]   than they were in the past.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.020]   I'm gonna do a chart on dividend yields.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.300]   This is the dividend yield on the S&P 500 since 1950.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.020]   You can see in 1950, it was like 7%.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.300]   That was abnormally high,
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.580]   mostly because of the Great Depression
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.980]   and the hangover from that.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.540]   But even in the '70s and '80s,
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.080]   we're talking three to 6% dividend yields, pretty high.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.820]   Today, it's closer to like 1.6,
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.020]   so the trend has been down since then.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.220]   Valuations are much higher.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.220]   That has something to do with it,
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.660]   but there's also a reason that you can see,
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.540]   starting in the 1980s,
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.740]   there was a precipitous drop in the dividend yield.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.160]   You can say, "Well, that's 'cause stocks were going up."
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.500]   But it's also because Congress passed a law
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.580]   in the early '80s that made it easier
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.180]   for corporations to buy back their own stock.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.820]   John, do the next chart.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.220]   This is buybacks and dividends.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.500]   This is going back to 1988 from Yardenia Research.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.660]   And I don't wanna go down the rabbit hole here,
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.020]   but essentially, stock buybacks and dividends
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.100]   are the same thing.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.780]   If you understand how math works
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.940]   and how capital allocation works,
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.180]   they're essentially the same thing.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.460]   So if you combine dividends and share buybacks,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.900]   the yield picture doesn't look quite so bleak.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.420]   It's closer to 5% now if you combine dividends and buybacks.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.580]   They have it at 4.9% here.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.220]   And so the shareholder yield is actually pretty good still.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.820]   So that's actually not that bad.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.700]   That's part of the reason.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.060]   And actually, from a tax basis,
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.220]   it's actually better for investors
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.920]   if they do buy back their stock.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.380]   So plus, you can't simply look at the yield itself
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.540]   to figure out the benefits.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.700]   The S&P 500 has seen total dividends since that 1950
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.320]   rise at an annual rate of nearly 6% per year.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.620]   Per year, that's above the 3% rate of inflation
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.940]   where dividends are growing above and beyond that.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.500]   So it's not like that yield is just,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.660]   the income is staying the same.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.620]   The income is rising,
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.220]   but the stock market is rising a little faster.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.620]   So you're getting an income stream
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.340]   that rises above the rate of inflation.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.580]   Earnings rise above that same level.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.100]   It is true that supply and demand matter.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.300]   So if more people decide they want to own shares
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.340]   in the stock market and they rush in to buy,
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.180]   the amount of investors willing to pay for them will rise.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.040]   So valuations go up.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.820]   If fewer people want to own stocks,
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.460]   then valuations will fall.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.540]   But even if fewer people wanted to own stocks in the future,
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.780]   it's not like profits would stop accruing.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.020]   You'd probably just see more corporations
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.780]   buy back their own stock and whoever did own stock
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.660]   would just see their share of earnings and dividends
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.860]   and all that stuff rise.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.980]   Plus money has to go somewhere.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.860]   So if everyone decided,
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.300]   we're taking all of our money out of the stock market,
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.700]   we're putting it in cash and bonds, right?
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.360]   I wouldn't recommend that, but if people did that,
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.860]   the yields would be so low that the stock market
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.220]   would have to look attractive on a relative basis.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.980]   So yes, there needs to be a buyer for every seller,
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.820]   but people aren't dumb.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.380]   If the stock market continues to see profits
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.060]   and cash flows rise, someone is going to buy.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.340]   So I think if you think the stock market is a Ponzi scheme
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.920]   and want to sit it out, that's fine.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.660]   More profits for us who want to own shares
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.500]   in the stock market.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.140]   That's the way I look at it.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.680]   It's, yeah, it's not a Ponzi scheme.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.700]   And the way that corporations work
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.700]   in as big and powerful as they are,
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.400]   they would just use their capital allocation
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.320]   to buy back shares,
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.180]   and then they'd be the ones accruing all the gains.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.460]   The gains are going to go to someone.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.180]   You might as well take a part in it.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.180]   - Yeah, I think the buyback stuff is a little confusing.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.360]   Yeah, I find that math a little confusing, honestly.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.180]   But, and I think a lot of people think,
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.940]   oh, I'm buying ownership in a company,
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.420]   essentially with my shares.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.180]   I should get some of the profit, right?
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.200]   And so I think that is the mentality sometimes.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.040]   - Quick example.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.580]   Let's say that you, there's $100 in profits.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.820]   There's five shareholders.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.660]   Each of them have $20 in earnings, right?
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.500]   Now let's say the company buys
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.460]   one of those shareholders out.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.540]   There's four shareholders, still $100 in profit, right?
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.620]   Now those profits are shared
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.820]   among only four shareholders instead of five.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.140]   So the profit per share goes up, right?
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.700]   - It's a white bull moment.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.440]   - Even if the profits are the same.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.300]   - Yeah, no, I haven't heard it explained that simply before.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.700]   So yeah, that makes sense.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.720]   - So whether they paid out dividends to people
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.060]   or bought back shares,
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.820]   the cash is gonna go out either way.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.780]   And so it's either people are gonna be paid back in cash
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.100]   or their earnings per share is gonna rise
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.420]   'cause the share count falls.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.620]   So it's the same thing.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.340]   A lot of people think this is like a,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.500]   it's like a weird buybacks,
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.900]   like this big like Illuminati thing,
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.340]   but it's not, it's pretty simple.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.420]   - Yeah, no, it sounds like it, yeah.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.260]   Team buybacks now.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.460]   - Do another one.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.900]   There you go.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.820]   - Up next, we have a question from Parker.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.260]   I've been laid off twice, once in 2015,
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.620]   and again in 2020 due to COVID.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.380]   I've had five jobs since then.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.320]   Currently VP of sales at a logistics company.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.540]   I've got about five months of household income saved,
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.860]   and for a few years, it sat in a brokerage account
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.980]   earning zero in a stable value fund.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.300]   Stupid, maybe, but it was safe.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.860]   So where do you recommend people put their emergency funds?
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.940]   What do you think about online banks?
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.620]   So this is one of those common things we get asked about.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.540]   - Well, I mean, you talked about risk tolerance
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.460]   for investors.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.820]   We talk a lot about that in the investing world.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.660]   People rarely talk about tolerance for risk
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.260]   when it comes to personal finance.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.980]   And I think this person, Parker,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.660]   being laid off twice, changing jobs three other times,
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.500]   that's a lot.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.500]   Hopefully, they're one of these people
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.900]   that is changing jobs and getting paid more.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.020]   That's what the stats say now.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.060]   People who are changing jobs are getting much higher wages
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.100]   and people are sticking, staying put.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.780]   But if you're going to have some sort of career
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.220]   where you're gonna have that much volatility,
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.860]   I don't know what they do or what field they're in,
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.540]   but then you probably wanna have
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.860]   a little more set aside, right?
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.500]   So there's all sorts of different,
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.820]   should I have 12 months saved
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.980]   or six months or three months?
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.860]   A lot of it depends on your tolerance for volatility
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.940]   in your personal finances,
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.500]   but also how your career is set up.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.980]   There are a lot more options these days.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.660]   Like him, I had my money sitting in an online savings account
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.500]   for years earning nothing.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.740]   I think it got as low as 25 basis points
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.900]   during the pandemic in 2020,
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.860]   when the Fed went down to zero.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.940]   I did a quick perusal of them today.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.620]   So you have places like Ally, Marcus, Capital One 360, SoFi,
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.740]   even like Wealthfront, Betterment, Robinhood
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.220]   have cash management programs.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.060]   I found anything in the range of 3.3% to 3.8% for these,
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:07.060]   you know, and FDIC insured and fairly safe and liquid.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.780]   You could find a one to three month T-bill ETF these days,
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.500]   pretty easy if you Google it, 4.3%,
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.900]   I think I saw this morning.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.580]   I saw a money market account for a client this morning
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.940]   at Schwab yielding over 4%.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.700]   12 month CD, I looked today, 4.3%.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.720]   Series I savings bonds, we've talked about them a lot here,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.740]   still yielding 6.9% until April,
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.180]   at which point I would expect that number to fall
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.500]   quite a bit because inflation is falling.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.620]   So there are tons of options today.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.920]   And in the past few years,
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.460]   you had to go way out on the risk curve
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.820]   to earn anything approaching yield.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.660]   This is all relatively safe stuff.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.660]   It's FDIC insured for the most part.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.740]   If you're investing in short-term government bonds,
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.500]   the chance of default is basically nil
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.220]   unless we get an alien invasion.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.260]   So savers are no longer being punished by the Fed,
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.100]   is what I'm saying.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.700]   This is one good thing the Fed is doing, I guess.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.660]   I think my only rule of thumb is don't put your money
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.500]   into something you have to jump through
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.340]   a bunch of hoops through.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.860]   Some of them will say you have to have a direct deposit,
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.780]   or you have to do like 10 transactions,
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.180]   or for an extra 10 basis points,
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.660]   to me, that's not really worth it.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.220]   I just think it should be something liquid,
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.620]   an easy technology interface.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.380]   And one of the reasons that these online banks
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.660]   can offer higher yields is because the brick and mortar banks
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.020]   have a lot more overhead.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.460]   And the banks are just kind of jerks,
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.900]   and they just, I think I looked at the average today,
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.860]   the average savings rate at an FDIC insured
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.380]   brick and mortar bank is like 24 basis points still.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.300]   It's ridiculous.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.420]   That should be criminal.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.500]   So you can get like 3.3, 3.5% at an online bank.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.140]   I think my only advice is just don't try to go yield hunting
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.180]   and jump from bank to bank or place to place
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.820]   'cause you can get an extra 10 or 20 basis points.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.660]   Just find a place you're comfortable with.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.020]   Make sure they're not taking advantage of you.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.420]   But I'd say nothing less than at least three,
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.300]   three and a quarter right now.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.940]   The fed funds rate is at four, four and a half percent.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.860]   So I would say anything lower than three and 3.25
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.780]   is probably too low, especially in the liquid stuff.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.900]   - Yeah, it kind of reminds me of you guys
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.420]   talking about refinancing a house.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.540]   There has to be a big enough gap for it to be worth
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.100]   you switching all of your stuff around.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.260]   You can't just do it for like 25 basis points.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.020]   - But if you have money in a big bank
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.620]   and it's paying you 20 basis points, yes.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.180]   Go through the process of opening a new account
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.140]   in the paperwork and move it over.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.980]   - Right.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.260]   And not to brag, but I'm getting 4.05, so.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.740]   - Where at?
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.300]   - Enzo, so.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.140]   - Okay.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.580]   I'm sure I missed a ton of different ones
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.420]   that are out there.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.900]   I know there's a lot of platforms these days.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.460]   There's a lot.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.660]   - You had to go two decimal points out there, didn't you?
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.180]   Just to 4.05%.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.020]   All right.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.860]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.820]   - 0.05% is doing a lot of work here.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.620]   - Hey, well, 0.05 is what I was getting at my big bank,
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.660]   like you're saying before.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.380]   So it's literally 4% more.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.220]   - All right.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.340]   Okay, so up next, we have a question from Hector.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.020]   I have over 180 hours of PTO.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.860]   That's paid time off, right?
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.500]   That will never come close to fully collecting.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.460]   Those hours are equal to four and a half weeks of vacation
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.220]   or pay if I resign or get laid off.
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.340]   Do you think it's a viable option to use my unused PTO
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.940]   as an emergency fund?
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.980]   I'm building up my liquid cash emergency fund
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.500]   and I have close to two months saved.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.660]   If this is a viable option,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.420]   two months of cash savings is all I would need to save.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   Thoughts?
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.820]   - So I have some thoughts on this
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.940]   after whatever you have to say.
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.100]   - Can we use two questions about emergency savings funds
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.900]   as a way of how the market are going
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.780]   and potentially a recession indicator?
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.700]   - Yeah.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.020]   - We definitely weren't getting these questions
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.620]   in 2020 and 2021.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.460]   - No.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.580]   - Four and a half weeks of pay
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.460]   is certainly a nice fallback plan.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.100]   This depends on how you define emergency, I think.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.020]   So I don't know, how easily could you cash in
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.260]   on that vacation paying and get it in a pinch
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.100]   if you really needed it?
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.340]   Like, would it take some time for a company to pay it out?
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.500]   Are you sure that money's coming to you
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.980]   if you get laid off?
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.020]   I just, I'm not questioning your company,
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.380]   but I would feel safer if that money
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.500]   was in my checking account or savings account
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.100]   and doing something for me.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.580]   Maybe if you can cash it out every six months or 12 months,
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.420]   just in case.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.420]   Again, I think a lot of it comes down
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.860]   to what you consider an actual emergency,
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.500]   like versus infrequent expenses.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.460]   So some people plan for car expenses and home maintenance
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.660]   and healthcare expenses,
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.460]   and those aren't actual emergencies.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.740]   Those are things that happen infrequently,
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.700]   but they're expenses you can plan on.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.780]   An actual emergency is when the apartment above you
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.700]   leaves their windows open and turns their heat off
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.860]   and the pipes freeze, and then it floods your apartment,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.540]   like you, Duncan, right?
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.660]   That's an actual emergency
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.740]   that you'd wanna have a fallback plan for, right?
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.540]   Which is why you're a vagabond right now
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.100]   and have nowhere to live.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.900]   Losing your job is obviously an emergency.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.740]   I think it also depends
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.500]   on what other kind of backup plans you have,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.820]   like do you have a home equity line of credit
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.180]   or a taxable investment account
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.780]   that you could sell a Roth IRA contributions
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.820]   that you'd wanna tap?
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.060]   Maybe like a 0% credit card,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.820]   something that could bridge the gap
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.380]   if you really need that money
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.940]   until you could get those four and a half weeks paid off.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.780]   What do you think?
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.220]   What are your reservations here?
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.580]   - Yeah, no, I was gonna say basically the same thing.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.460]   I was just gonna say, yeah,
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.940]   in my situation with an apartment being flooded,
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.660]   yes, we have renter's insurance.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.380]   They're gonna cover most everything
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.140]   outside of the deductible, obviously,
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.180]   but we're having to pay out of pocket, right?
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.580]   And so there are a bunch of huge expenses upfront,
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.660]   like getting an Airbnb in Brooklyn
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.540]   or somewhere around New York City,
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.540]   ranges like I'm seeing 8,000, 10,000 plus for a month,
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.700]   that kind of stuff.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.940]   And so yeah, just having like a fund
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.180]   that you can pull that from
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.980]   would be much more helpful than probably being like,
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.460]   oh, I would have to quit my job to get my PTO
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.060]   and be able to have this cash up front.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.260]   'Cause I don't think most places
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.540]   will give you money for your PTO
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.060]   until you literally are leaving, right?
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.140]   It's not like you can cash it out, I don't think.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.460]   - Right, it could be that.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.980]   So if that's what your biggest worry is,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.020]   losing your job, then maybe it's it.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.260]   But I think if I'm talking about
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.460]   an actual emergency savings, I want it to be liquid
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.020]   and I wanna get it within 24 hours or so.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.860]   I want it to be relatively easy
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.860]   to get most online savings accounts.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.580]   You'll have the money if you put in for a transfer withdrawal
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.620]   within that day or the next day.
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.060]   It doesn't take all, if you have,
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.100]   even if you have an ETF that you have it in short-term cash,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.580]   it'll settle in a couple of days.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.100]   So yeah, I'd be worried about using this
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.980]   as an actual emergency.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.660]   But maybe if your emergency you're planning for
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.040]   is losing your job, then it makes sense.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.880]   - Right, and yeah, and just a PSA,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.620]   if you live in an apartment, be a good neighbor
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.340]   and don't leave your windows open and heat off
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.300]   when it's below zero outside, you know?
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.140]   But yeah.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.340]   - That's rough.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.160]   They should have to do the walk of shame
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.340]   and just out of the building.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.380]   - They should, they really should.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.940]   Okay, so-- - We got one more.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.740]   - Yeah, last but not least, we have a question from Tom.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.820]   I'm in my mid-60s with retirement coming very soon.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.660]   There's a lot of doom and gloom for people in my position
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.820]   with the market dropping just as we're retiring.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.380]   However, I hope to be in the market 20 years from now
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.580]   and still see myself as a long-term investor.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.020]   Even after retirement, we're still investors, right?
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.420]   - Excellent point here, Tom.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.260]   - And congrats-- - Great question.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.100]   - Congrats on retiring, yeah.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.240]   - Yes, now there's two ways to look at that.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.860]   It stinks that you're retiring right when
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.240]   markets are dropping, but also you had 10 years
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.740]   of fantastic returns to get your portfolio to a level
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.320]   that made it sting when it dropped.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.300]   So it's kind of a double-edged sword there,
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.100]   where you were doing pretty good up until this point,
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.620]   and your portfolio would not have been as high
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.420]   if we didn't have the gains that preceded this bear market.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.580]   And it's possible the only reason stocks are falling a lot
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.020]   is because they went up a lot in the first place.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.380]   So the average American now retires at 62.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.140]   100 years ago, the average American died at 51.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.460]   Most people worked until they died.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.180]   According to the Social Security Administration,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.100]   they actually have this cool longevity thing.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.620]   You can put in your age or your spouse's age
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.480]   and see how long your life expectancy is,
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.940]   based on some averages.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.080]   A couple retiring today has a 50% chance
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.380]   at least one of them will live into their 90s.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   So most people want a retirement where they can relax
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.700]   and enjoy themselves, and most people probably retire
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.580]   quicker than they would have assumed.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.620]   People think, oh, if I don't have enough money,
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.620]   I'll just keep working until retirement.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.660]   A lot of times, your health won't allow for it,
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.740]   or just when you get to that age,
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.980]   you're just, I'm done with it, I'm ready to be done.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.700]   So that could mean two to three decades
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.660]   of investing after retiring.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.940]   Maybe four if you live long enough.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.920]   So there is less human capital where you don't have
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.600]   as much income coming in, you're not saving,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.580]   you don't have the ability to wait out bear markets
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.840]   as much as you did in the past as a young person,
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.840]   because your biggest asset should be financial assets
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.620]   at this point, right?
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.680]   So you're not like someone who's accumulating
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.440]   can take advantage of a bear market.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.600]   So there's more balance involved at this stage.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   I just think you have to keep that balance
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.440]   of protecting your wealth on one side
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.000]   versus you need to keep up your standard of living
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.840]   on the other side, right?
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.700]   John, do a chart on of inflation here.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.320]   This is just a simple thing that we've shown over time.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.200]   How long it takes for different inflation rates
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.160]   to cut your money in half.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.620]   So 3% inflation rate is about the long-term average.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.640]   It takes 23 years to cut it in half.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.480]   If you're a millionaire today,
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.840]   that million's worth $500,000 in 23 years.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.720]   4%, it would be 17 years, 5%, 14 years, even 2%,
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.000]   it's 35 years if we're using the handy rule of 72.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.880]   So unless you have more money than you know what to do with,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.840]   the stock market is likely gonna have to play a role
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.280]   in your portfolio in some fashion,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.920]   because it remains the best bet for beating inflation
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.400]   over the long-term.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.220]   Well, the short-term, obviously,
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.960]   inflation can ding stocks like it has recently.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.560]   So one of the ways I like to think about this
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.400]   is in terms of spending.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.560]   So let's say you land on 4% of your portfolio each year
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.060]   you're gonna take out for spending purposes, right?
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.680]   That's how you cover your spending each year
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.240]   and your way of living.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.680]   If you had a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.000]   that would give you 10 years worth of spending, right?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.560]   A 40/60 portfolio would give you 15 years worth of spending
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.600]   in fixed income or cash or something like that.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.640]   Now, this ignores inflation in your spending over time,
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.480]   so it's pretty back of the envelope.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.200]   But I think this is a good way to look at things
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.280]   in terms of getting comfortable with some balance
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.880]   and the understanding that you have to have
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.760]   accept some volatility in your portfolio
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.600]   if you want to beat the rate of inflation over time.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.460]   So a lot of retirees are gonna wanna leave money
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.500]   to next generation as well.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.480]   Most retirees who have a lot of money
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.200]   don't end up spending at all.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   And so if that's the case,
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.760]   you're managing based on your children's
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.240]   or your grandchildren's time horizon and risk profile.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.660]   And that's theirs, not yours.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.760]   So I know it's a scary proposition
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.940]   once you're relying exclusively on financial assets
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.760]   to support your lifestyle,
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.960]   but you're gonna have to live to accept
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.280]   a little bit of volatility with part of your portfolio.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.960]   Maybe you kind of mentally bucket this.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.000]   You know, this part of the portfolio,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.360]   this 20, 30, 40, 50% is for the next 10 plus years.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.640]   This part is for the next one to three years.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.120]   This part is for the next three to seven years.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.360]   Whatever you have to do to get yourself comfortable there
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.800]   because you're balancing out spending some now
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.220]   and also growing it for the future.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.780]   So that's the kind of thing where it stinks.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.140]   It would be nice if you could just put your money
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.820]   into something that paid you 7% a year,
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.640]   year in and year out.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.700]   It doesn't really exist, unfortunately,
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.260]   and you're just gonna have to live with some volatility
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.900]   because people are living longer.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.220]   - Right, I think I like their attitude here
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.500]   of thinking about, you know, yeah, still staying invested.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.220]   It's not like it's a end date
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.140]   where you're cashing out all of your retirement plans
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:46.980]   or something.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.000]   They make the point that your portfolio management
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.900]   is never more important than when you are retired, right?
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.080]   'Cause when you're accumulating assets
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.860]   and you're putting money to work,
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.840]   your asset allocation doesn't matter nearly as much
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.120]   as it does when you're actually retiring.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.960]   And withdrawing money and financial planning
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.800]   and all this stuff, there's so much more that goes into it,
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.260]   which is why we have a lot of clients come to us
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.240]   when they're approaching retirement
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.080]   because there's a lot more complexities involved in that.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.520]   - And that's actually what I was about to ask,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.960]   if that's a popular time for people
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.000]   to get an advisor for the first time.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.240]   It seems counterintuitive,
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.500]   but like when they're actually retiring.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.500]   - Because financial planning and advice
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.340]   is so much more important.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.180]   Taxes are more important.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.660]   Insurance is more important.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.580]   All these things, it's definitely a mindset shift too,
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.700]   psychologically, to go from being an accumulator of assets
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.140]   to someone who's then spending it down.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.960]   That can be tough for people to turn on a dime
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.640]   and then spend because they just want to hoard it all
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.480]   their whole life.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.780]   And then to turn around and have to spend it,
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.500]   it's tough when there's not anything else coming in.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   - Right.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.340]   That makes sense.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.500]   Cool.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.340]   All right.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.160]   Next week, we are going to be back
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.000]   going over all the changes
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.160]   to retirement contribution limits, tax code,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.080]   everything else you need to know for the new year.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:51.920]   So if you have any questions,
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.120]   remember email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.

[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.120]   Every week you can just talk about Duncan's hats, right?
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.200]   The guy's never without a hat.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.800]   - I got some new ones for the holidays too.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.960]   So keep your eyes peeled.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.800]   There'll be some new ones.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.620]   - Perfect.

[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.640]   We'll have guests going forward.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.480]   - Happy New Year, man.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.140]   - I'm not going to say it back.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.860]   And we will see you next week.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.800]   - See you everyone.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.880]   (gentle music)
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.940]   you
