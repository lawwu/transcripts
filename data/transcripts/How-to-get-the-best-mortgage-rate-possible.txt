[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.800]   And in this podcast, I'm going to share
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.400]   how I failed at getting the lowest mortgage interest
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.000]   rate possible.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   So in the month of April 2019, the yield curve inverted.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.600]   And that's great news for mortgage holders
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.240]   because we get to refinance our mortgage at a relatively better
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.920]   rate.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.680]   So short-term rates are higher than long-term rates.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320]   And therefore, you must take advantage.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.200]   Everything is relative in finance.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.080]   So I was going to say that I got the best mortgage rate possible,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.040]   but I ended up failing.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.800]   I didn't get what I wanted and what I thought I could get.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.760]   And I wanted to run you guys through why.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.160]   So before I run you guys through why I failed,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.440]   I want to share, in general, the best practices for how to get
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.680]   the best mortgage rate possible.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.080]   The key to getting better pricing
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.160]   is to always generate competition.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.640]   For example, the more employers compete for your services,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.480]   the more you will get bid away for a higher salary.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.080]   And the more likely your employer
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.560]   will match that bid away price or just give you a raise.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.200]   I still remember sitting in the living room of a house I wanted
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.240]   to buy back in 2004.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.400]   The asking price was $1.55 million,
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.480]   and it had been sitting on the market for two months.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.440]   I was tempted to offer $1.45 million because why not?
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.040]   You've been sitting for two months.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.640]   Obviously, nobody's interested.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.040]   And this was pretty unusual, even for San Francisco
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.400]   at that time.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.360]   And I had made up my mind to lowball the sellers
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.080]   when in walked a doctor couple at the open house.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.120]   They sat in the dining room and marveled
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.760]   at all the details of the house--
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.840]   the high ceilings, the wainscoting, crown moldings,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.320]   and so forth.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.800]   So seeing them instantly created this FOMO,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.440]   fear that I was going to miss out.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.960]   My desire to lowball instantly faded away
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.880]   as they began talking.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.960]   So instead, I offered $1.525 million, or 75% more
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.920]   than I had originally planned.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   And I still wonder to this day if my emotions
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.200]   got the best of me.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.080]   But thankfully, it all worked out in the end
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.760]   because I was able to sell that house in 2017 for much more
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.800]   than I purchased it for.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.880]   So here are the steps I take to get the best mortgage
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.040]   rate possible.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.560]   I've refinanced, I think, eight times, maybe more,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.960]   four properties since 2003.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.200]   I mean, it's been kind of a refinance bonanza
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800]   for the business, for the lending business,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.440]   since interest rates have been coming down basically
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.600]   since the late 1980s.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   So there are basically four steps.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.480]   First step, get written official quotes from competing lenders.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.400]   Verbal offers really don't mean much at all.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   In all my experience, every single lender
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.960]   is like, hey, show me a written offer,
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.440]   and we'll match or beat it.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.560]   And the easiest way to do that is to go online and get quotes.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.000]   And then people will contact you,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and then they're going to email you and say, hey,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.320]   we can do this for you at this price.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.520]   Two, use those quotes to contact your relationship bank.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.760]   Your relationship bank is your main bank,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.840]   the one where you have your checking account tied to
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.120]   or your work pay stub paycheck that
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.480]   gets automatically credited every single, what,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.680]   two weeks or every single month.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.240]   Your relationship bank is the key
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.280]   to getting the best mortgage rate possible.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.280]   They have a lot of your money, and you probably
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   have multiple, multiple accounts with them.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.120]   They certainly don't want to lose your business.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.280]   And you must present that written offer.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.400]   And if you don't have a competitive written offer,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160]   you've got to get one.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.080]   And one strategy-- this is an interesting strategy--
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.520]   is to scour the internet and take
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.100]   snapshots of teaser rates some lenders or marketplaces
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.840]   offer if you just can't get anything
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.400]   official in writing or email.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.200]   Now, these teaser rates are interesting
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.480]   because they're real, but just like when you go up
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.640]   and show at the car dealership for that really cheap car
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.360]   that they've been advertising, they're going to say, well,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.440]   it's already been sold.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.860]   They're just trying to get you in.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.800]   So the teaser rate was probably real at one point,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.200]   but once you go and ask for that rate,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.700]   it's probably not going to be there.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.880]   But you can use that rate to your advantage.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.820]   Three, promise more assets.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.740]   A bank wants its customers to have as much money with them
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.900]   as possible.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.300]   Further, they want you to open up
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.340]   as many different accounts as possible to keep you
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.460]   as a sticky customer.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.900]   This is cross-selling, one-on-one.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.380]   So different accounts include checking account, business
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.860]   account, savings account, mortgage account,
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.580]   wealth management account, home equity line of credit,
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.780]   and a personal line of credit, which I don't really
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.180]   recommend because the interest rate is a little bit high.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.360]   The more money you can bring over to the bank
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.160]   and the more accounts you can open,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.640]   the more attractive your mortgage interest rate offer
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.080]   will be.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.280]   Banks have different tiers based on how much you have.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.560]   What I've noticed is three tiers, basically.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.920]   The first tier is if you have over $250,000 in assets
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.520]   with them.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.200]   That includes your investments.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.280]   Second tier is if you have over $500,000 in assets with them.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.160]   And the highest tier for the best pricing
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.720]   is if you have over $1 million in assets with them.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.360]   And then finally, be ready to transfer funds away.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.720]   The person who is willing to walk away
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.400]   from any kind of transaction generally
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.980]   has the highest leverage because you're basically
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.040]   threatening to move your assets if you don't get the best price
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.640]   or don't even get the best match, right?
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.920]   So you better be able to walk the walk--
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.000]   what is it, talk the talk and then walk the walk and move.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.560]   Money is really fungible nowadays.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.640]   You can transfer money at the click of a button.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.160]   Maybe it takes a couple of clicks.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.100]   But whatever the case may be, you
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.340]   need to walk if they don't give you the best.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.220]   You don't have to close all your accounts.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.500]   You just have to be willing to open a new account
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.540]   with a different bank and go through the process
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.400]   of electronic funds transfer.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.480]   So there you have it.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.220]   Four easy steps, right?
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.100]   Well, I did all those four steps this time,
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.060]   and I didn't make it.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.180]   The best mortgage rate I could have gotten
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.460]   was 2.75% for a 7-1 arm with no refinancing cost at Wells Fargo.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.380]   Wells Fargo, if I transferred over $1 million.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.800]   If I transferred over $500,000, I
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.100]   could have locked in 2.875% for a 7-1 arm
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.760]   with no refinancing costs.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.500]   Unfortunately, none of this happened.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.980]   The best I got was a 10-1 arm--
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.580]   not bad, 10-1 arm--
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.060]   but at 3% with about $3,000 in credits to closing.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.460]   So I don't think it's going to be free,
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.740]   but it's going to be almost free.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.060]   The better Wells Fargo rate was introduced to me
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.620]   by a financial samurai reader.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.780]   The reader took a couple of days to get back to me by email
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.740]   after I asked about the lender's contact information.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.940]   And as soon as I got the information,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.580]   I showed the rate offer to my existing relationship bank
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.620]   for 18 years-- of 18 years--
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.380]   Citibank to see if they could match.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.020]   I had just locked in my 3% rate with Citibank, which
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.020]   I thought was pretty good after the 10-year yield
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.900]   declined to 2.45% from 3.2%.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.980]   But I had not yet given Citibank approval
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.100]   to start the process yet.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.980]   So this is really important for folks looking to refinance.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.500]   You've always got time to make a final decision after you
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.460]   verbally agree to lock.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.980]   Don't let them bully you or pressure you
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.020]   into signing right away to give them approval to proceed.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.060]   You have time.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.540]   And time is really valuable when you're trying
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.180]   to get the best rate possible.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.500]   So I used this Wells Fargo offer as leverage,
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.320]   and I showed it to Citibank.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.660]   And surprisingly, they told me they could not
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.420]   match the rate, even though they said I could probably
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.700]   get 2.875% with minimal closing costs if I locked with them
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.220]   when I did at 3%.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.580]   So when I verbally agreed to 3%, they
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.140]   said they were going to have a special promotion
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.780]   the following week to get me down to 2.75%, 2.875%.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.160]   So when I asked them, and then I actually got this written
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.140]   offer, they said no.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.540]   So in other words, I was totally led on, in my opinion.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.500]   I told them I was going to move $1 million in assets
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.540]   to Wells Fargo if they didn't at least match the 2.875% rate.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.580]   And the mortgage lender said, OK, fine.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.260]   He'll go to the head of mortgage lending in San Francisco
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.900]   to see if he could get me down to 2.875%.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.060]   I waited another day, and the city mortgage head said,
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.260]   sorry, he still couldn't match the 2.875%,
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.820]   even though he told me to show him a better offer.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.540]   So at least he gave me another seven days
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.500]   to decide whether I should refinance with Citibank at 3%.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.220]   Now I was much more motivated to work with Wells Fargo instead.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.100]   It took another day and a half for the Wells Fargo mortgage
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.740]   officer to get back to me.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.020]   We spoke at around 5:15 PM.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.140]   He said I could absolutely refinance with them at 2.75%
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.740]   to 2.875% if I brought over $500,000 to $1 million.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.820]   But first, I had to send him some common documents,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.060]   such as my W-2, 1099s, rental statements, K-1s, and so forth.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.860]   So I got back to Wells Fargo at around 7:30 PM,
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.500]   and he said he'd review the documents
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.220]   and continue our dialogue the next morning.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.820]   I believed him.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.420]   I said, OK, fine.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.020]   He said there's no rush because rates
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.000]   looked unchanged that evening.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.500]   And I looked, and yeah, that's fine.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.260]   So when he called me the next morning at 10 AM,
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.820]   he said he had bad news.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.660]   He said his bank informed him as of that morning
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.460]   they decided to discontinue their special mortgage rate
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.740]   promotion.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.980]   There was just too much demand.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.580]   And I was thinking to myself, come on.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.460]   Are you kidding me?
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.700]   It's either I have the worst timing,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.420]   or you're baiting and switching me.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.620]   So he said, well, I'm sorry about this.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.740]   I'm going to have a lot of difficult conversations
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.020]   with other clients.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.300]   But if I still wanted to refinance with him, I could.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.780]   The rate would no longer be 2.875% with $500,000
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.540]   in assets moved over.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.420]   It'll be more like 3% or 3.125% with no fees.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.660]   I was like, OK, you know what?
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.980]   Forget it, man.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.740]   If I'm going to get bait and switched,
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.180]   I might as well go to the original gangster bait
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.180]   and switch bank, which is Citibank.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.740]   So at the very least, luckily I didn't waste too much of my time
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.020]   because the documents I gathered for Wells Fargo
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.820]   were necessary for my refinance with Citibank.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.700]   I simply forwarded that email to the Citibank mortgage officer.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.020]   So there you have it.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.380]   While I was busy writing articles encouraging readers
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.580]   to refinance during a flat or inverted yield curve,
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.900]   I wasn't spending enough time aggressively trying
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.500]   to refinance my own mortgage.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.020]   I put too much faith in my relationship bank
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.300]   that they would match.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.540]   Too much faith.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.700]   This cost me time and motivation with a competing bank.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:28.380]   I didn't pounce hard enough on the 2.75, 2.875 offer
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.820]   with Wells Fargo because, you know what?
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.740]   I admittedly didn't want to go through the hassle of moving
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.340]   my funds.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.180]   I just wanted really to leverage them, to be frank.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.020]   But you know what?
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   Look, if the rate was more like 2.5% or 2.65%,
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.220]   I would have moved.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.340]   I would have locked with Wells Fargo and transferred my money.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.100]   So I hope everyone takes away from this podcast
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.100]   that timing is important.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.540]   Timing is the reason why I produce these podcasts
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.260]   and I write these posts when there's an opportunity
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.180]   to save money.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.220]   Because saving money is very concrete.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.940]   Whereas investing money, you don't really
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.620]   know until the future whether you made a good investment
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.340]   decision today.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.580]   And the other point is know that you have time.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.020]   You have time when you verbally agree to lock
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.300]   to shop around that offer.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.260]   Banks seem to be kind of ruthless.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.380]   There's a lot of, hey, bringing you in with attractive rates,
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.220]   but then telling you the next day or the next week
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.060]   that they can't really match.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.340]   So these guys are ruthless in terms
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.980]   of the way they do business.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.980]   And they want to obviously maximize their profits.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.780]   And you want to maximize your savings.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.340]   So don't be afraid to negotiate.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.140]   Don't be afraid to get other offers.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.540]   And don't be afraid to pit each bank against each other.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.700]   So good luck, everyone.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.980]   Rates are still low, although they've been creaming up
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.540]   a little bit as the stock market continues to march higher.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.340]   But there's nothing better than saving money
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.580]   and taking advantage.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.020]   And I'm still a strong proponent of adjustable rate mortgages,
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.020]   because the average homeowner owns their home
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.220]   for about 8.3 years.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.380]   And that's like the highest in a long, long time.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.460]   So if you're going to go lock in for a 30-year fixed rate,
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.620]   that is not congruent with what the statistics say.
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.620]   So good luck, everyone.
