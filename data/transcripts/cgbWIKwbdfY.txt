[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]   Alright, so here's a non-baseball related question.
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.940]   We got Marguerite, who says, "What lessons can be learned from how modern Orthodox Jews
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.600]   who are found in every field navigate their Saturday Shabbat to abstain from any electronic
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   inputs?"
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   Well, I'm a big believer in the practice of Shabbat.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.040]   I don't care as much about the super specifics of the rules, right?
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.280]   Like exactly what you can use or don't use, and does a combustion engine, is that going
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.440]   to count as creating energy, and can you turn on the light or not turn on the light?
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120]   So I'm not too caught up in the specific rules that maybe if you were a modern Orthodox Jew,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.440]   you might think about how do we interpret this versus a different level of observance.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.080]   But the thing I'm a big believer in is the underlying idea here of having this day of
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.120]   rest for your mind to reset and to connect on other things that are important that aren't
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.480]   related to work and aren't related to the news.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.920]   I think this is a fantastic ritual.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.320]   What I think is important, this is what I more or less do, no work, no email, no digital
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   news.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.640]   So just all of those stimulating things, the outside world stimulating and trying to capture
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.320]   your mind, Friday sundown, Saturday sundown, take them out of your life.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.280]   I think everyone could use that, and everyone could find some relief in not just being away
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.160]   from that, but rediscovering the things that that keeps them away from.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.080]   Friday night, it can be family, you're connected to your family.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.440]   The next day, it's activities, you go and do things, you read, but you're not in that
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.840]   peak state of anxious information consumption.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.920]   So we do that.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   We do something like that, Friday sundown, Saturday sundown, and maybe we'll even refine
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   that practice.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.220]   But I think there's great wisdom there.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.880]   And this should not be a surprise.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.680]   It's something I talk about a fair amount, that wisdom traditions have a lot of wisdom
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.960]   to offer, because it is not just an arbitrary book.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.240]   Wisdom traditions often, what you have here is ideas and thoughts and rituals and techniques
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.680]   and practices for living that have been battle tested in harder situations than you live
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.040]   in now.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.480]   And a lot of stuff didn't survive, but the stuff that has survived, the stuff that we
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.760]   will consider revelation, give it that moniker, is the things that actually seem to work,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.360]   the spiritual technologies that actually seem compatible with the way that the human mind
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.840]   and the human soul actually operates.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.480]   There's a reason why the books stick around.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.160]   It's why the Tanakh is still here, 2,800 years later, is because there's something deeply
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.480]   true about a lot of these ideas.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.220]   So we shouldn't be surprised that in one of our oldest wisdom traditions still surviving,
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.000]   we find this idea, this idea that is laid down in Genesis.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.300]   I mean, we're talking very old.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.720]   God took the seventh day and he rested.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.180]   There is wisdom in it that makes complete sense when now today in 2022, you put down
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.480]   the phone on Friday night and there is no Twitter and there is no Instagram and you're
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.320]   not scrolling for things and you're not checking through emails.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.520]   There's a perspective, there's a peace, there's a calmness.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.680]   I'm a big Shabbat fan, so I recommend it.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.280]   [MUSIC]
