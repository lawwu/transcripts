[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Pastor John, you're back home in Knoxville
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.360]   after a lengthy trip to the Middle East,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.760]   your first trip to the Middle East.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.480]   Can you give us a summary of your travels
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.720]   and share with us some of the things
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.940]   that you did along the way?
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.680]   - It was a three week trip, Tony.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.680]   We went to Ethiopia first and spent a week there,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.880]   spoke in four churches and did a Bible conference
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.200]   with Jason Meyer, who has replaced me at Bethlehem.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.920]   It was thrilling to do the tag team preaching
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.240]   with Jason in a conference on 2 Corinthians
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.120]   and to be a part of the churches there
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.360]   and see what God is doing in Ethiopia.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560]   I was so encouraged in several of these churches
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.320]   and how God is at work and saw the importance
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.700]   of the sovereignty of God and saw the cry
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.000]   of the Ethiopian church to help them train pastors
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.360]   because the spread of the gospel is huge
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.560]   in Southern Ethiopia and probably 80% of the pastors
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.200]   there have no theological training
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.960]   and they are very good at evangelism,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.160]   they were telling me, and yet the need
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.320]   for ongoing training and equipping and deepening
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.080]   of the leadership for the sake of the people is just huge.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.280]   So I would just encourage any listeners
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200]   to give your life away in Bible teaching
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.560]   and pastoral enrichment and world missions in this way.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   Then we went over to the UAE, which is on the Gulf,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.960]   the Arab Peninsula, so the peninsula that has Saudi Arabia
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.360]   in the middle of the huge mass and then Kuwait up the top
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.280]   and then come down to the horn, there's Qatar and UAE
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.160]   and then around the corner is Oman and Yemen.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.880]   These are the Gulf oil states and all kinds
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.080]   of revelations were happening to me
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.380]   about things I did not realize here
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.840]   that basically these countries are more friendly
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.320]   toward the United States and just across the Persian Gulf
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   to the north and the east is Iran
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.080]   and Iran is the adversary, both of the US
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.120]   and of these states and when you think
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   of the Islamic surveillance on the people
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.740]   in the UAE where I was, I was told they're not worried
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.940]   about Christians, they're worried about radical Islam
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.940]   who could upset the balance of good relationships
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.820]   between them and the United States who provide so much
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.340]   of their help in the oil drilling
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.420]   and in the selling of their oil.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.220]   It's a hugely rich land, the UAE is.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.840]   The country 40 years ago was sand.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.860]   Today, Dubai is probably the most modern city in the world.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.300]   It's got the tallest building in the world.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.300]   There are 450 skyscrapers, meaning over 40 stories tall.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   It's got huge malls, it's got sophisticated infrastructure
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.980]   and all of that is largely provided by the expertise
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.140]   from the West and therefore,
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.340]   they don't want those relationships messed up
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.740]   by the Muslim Brotherhood coming in here
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.220]   and producing another Arab Spring.
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.500]   So when the Arab Spring happened in the other countries
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.280]   and the people rose up and started to throw off
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.580]   their leaders, the wealthy leaders in UAE
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.140]   upped the salaries of all their emirates
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.860]   and made everybody happy because they produce
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.820]   about 3,000, I mean, 3 million barrels of oil a day,
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.140]   each of them worth about $100.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.780]   And so this country is owned and led
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.780]   by a benevolent dictatorship of about seven sheikhs
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.860]   who are the landed powerful families
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.260]   and one of them is the main one
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.020]   and so they have all this money
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.340]   and they have used it to make their people very happy
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.880]   and they've built these huge cities
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.060]   and it's built on sand in more ways than one.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.380]   I mean, a lot of people look at the Burj Khalifa
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.780]   which is the tallest building in the world
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.580]   and they say it's just like the Tower of Babel
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.020]   and it is because they built it
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.540]   to make a name for themselves.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.380]   The word Khalifa is the name of the sheikh
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.880]   who provided the money to finish it
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.140]   when they ran out of money in Dubai.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.140]   And so it's fragile in the sense that it's oil money
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.980]   and the expertise is coming from elsewhere.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.860]   So that about 85% of the people who live in the UAE
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.020]   are from outside that country
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.620]   and therefore the expertise and the manpower
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.320]   both at the lowest levels of labor
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.740]   that are almost like slaves
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.580]   and the highest level of expertise in the high rises
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.340]   are coming from outside UAE.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.660]   So what they have is money
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.780]   but they don't have a lot of expertise.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.980]   They're trying to rectify that
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.700]   with a lot of education.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.620]   The upshot of that from mission story was just phenomenal.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.620]   The Christians are not looked upon disrespectfully there.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.500]   The sheikhs have provided land in several of the Emirates
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.060]   in order that the Christians might build churches on them.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.140]   They know that since they have 85% people
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.500]   coming from outside the country to work there,
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.260]   they need to provide for them and make them happy.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.220]   So they know lots of them are Christians
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.660]   so let them have churches.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.300]   Well, that means that there are in Dubai,
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.020]   I talked to several people off this,
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.820]   there are probably a thousand churches in Dubai.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.180]   Now there are only half a dozen of those
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.540]   that are landed and provided for by the sheikhs
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.820]   but they all know, the sheikhs know,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.220]   the authorities know that these churches are there.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.320]   They know where they meet, when they meet
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.820]   and they are just turning away and letting them be.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.820]   What's against the law in UAE is proselytizing
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.580]   and if you ask people, what does that mean?
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.420]   You get a lot of different answers.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.700]   One Christian will say, it means paying a Muslim
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.980]   to be a Christian.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.280]   Another will say, it means giving them a Bible
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.660]   if they don't ask for it.
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.380]   In other words, it's a pretty ambiguous law
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.980]   and the reason I think it's ambiguous
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.460]   is because they're happy to leave it ambiguous
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.380]   so that they can kick out anybody they want
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.780]   and keep anybody they want.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.340]   And so there's amazing freedom.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.660]   I preached in Abu Dhabi, which is the capital,
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.260]   in the National Theater.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.940]   It was about half full and up at the top
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.860]   were these white-robed authorities
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.180]   making sure I didn't diss Muhammad
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.260]   or something that I shouldn't do
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.500]   and I preached the gospel there as clearly
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.300]   in terms of a propitiation and a substitutionary atonement,
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.940]   the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ,
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.780]   the necessity to believe on Christ
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.100]   and they were listening to all that.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.000]   So here you have a whole line of Muslims
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   who heard the gospel because they provide for Christians.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.020]   We had to advertise that event as for Christians.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.500]   Well, a guy told me the day before,
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.140]   I'm bringing six of my Muslim friends with me
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.320]   so I know that the gospel is being heard
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.220]   by the local Muslim people.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.800]   And one other observation maybe,
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.780]   I was just so thrilled with the kind of vision
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.020]   that some church planters and pastors have,
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.300]   in Dubai in particular, but across the Emirates.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.100]   I'm thankful for John Fulmer.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.420]   What an inspiration he was to me.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.260]   He's the pastor, or one of the pastors,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.180]   at the UCCD, United Christian Church of Dubai.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.220]   And that church has had a reformation,
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.660]   a theological transformation in the last nine years
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.500]   and then he's had a vision for filling the region
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.600]   with gospel preaching churches.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.560]   So they planted a church across town called Redeemer.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   They planted a church in Ras Al Khaimah
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.540]   and a fourth church in a nearby Emirates.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.600]   So there's a vision for filling the region
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.500]   with gospel preaching churches.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.540]   And in those churches are the most diverse gatherings
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.020]   of people that I've ever preached to.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.480]   I preached in two churches there
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   and both of them had between 60 and 70 different nations
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.500]   in the service.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.780]   And those people then work here for a season.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.920]   Many of them go back to their countries
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   and all those people work hand in glove, usually,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.840]   with local Muslim Emirates.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.720]   And if you go to joshuaproject.net,
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.920]   there are 28 Muslim peoples
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.640]   that are engaged in that region.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.840]   And this is at least one remarkable way of reaching them.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.180]   So the trip, Tony, was just incredibly encouraging to me
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.360]   at what God is doing there
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.040]   and was an education about the Middle East affairs
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.560]   that I hadn't realized.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.660]   And it just caused me to assess my own life
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.160]   and wanna throw it out to everyone else.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.240]   One of the missionaries we've had there
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.480]   for almost 20 years said,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.720]   "John, if you can just find me people
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.820]   "who would need to be men, in this case,
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.440]   "men who have been in their careers in engineering
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.500]   "for five years and have them send me their CVs,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.560]   "I can put them to work here teaching engineering
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.480]   "in a school and they would have contact
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.100]   "with Muslim students every day."
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.280]   - That's wonderful.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.560]   It sounds like the trip was wonderfully productive
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.800]   and how providential that the cross-conference
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.440]   on missions is right around the corner.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   - Well, it's interesting that the Lord would ordain
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.400]   that I spend three weeks overseas
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.320]   just a few weeks before the cross-conference
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   because my sense of its strategic importance
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.580]   has skyrocketed.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.020]   I mean, in principle, I always know
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.280]   that when you gather students together,
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.680]   historic, you have a tinderbox of potential
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.460]   for explosive world impact
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.680]   because God in the last several centuries at least
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.080]   has done amazing things through students
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   when they've gathered together for mission deliberation
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.000]   and agitation and education and outreach.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And so it's always been high,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   but having seen what God is doing in just one little pocket,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.040]   I mean, if you went to different places,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.800]   you'd have the same thing happen,
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.920]   makes me want to hold out to students
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   a possibility of dreaming a dream in missions.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   I sat beside the leader of SIM, I believe, in Ethiopia
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:02.520]   and asked him, "What could I do in my last 10 years,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.840]   say, if God gives me 10 years,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.480]   what could I do that would help you?"
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.040]   And he thought for a minute and he said three things.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.320]   I'll just mention one.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.640]   He said, "Send us, if you can,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.460]   missionaries with lifetime commitment.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.760]   It's hard to accomplish long-term goals
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.120]   with short-term commitment."
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.840]   So one of my dreams, Tony, for the Cross Conference
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   is to hold up the beauty of a life laid down
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.120]   and poured out in a place for Jesus.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.440]   I think the mentality for the past decades
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.200]   has been that in America,
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.760]   everybody will have five different vocations.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.920]   We're all very mobile.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.880]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.160]   It's a good thing.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.280]   Moving along, and there's nothing,
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.920]   there isn't anything intrinsically wrong with it.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   But what it does is minimize the beauty and the power
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.400]   and the beauty of staying at something.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   And in missions, it takes a long time to learn a language.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.440]   It takes a long time to be at home in a culture.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.720]   It takes a long time to win trust.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.000]   It takes a long time to see things strategically
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.160]   from inside another world.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.520]   And if you go there with the sense of,
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.640]   "Oh, I'll give a couple of years
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.920]   and then I'll be off to do another thing,"
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.160]   it's not the same.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.480]   And so that's one of the excitements I have
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.680]   is that maybe God would be pleased in our day
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.720]   to turn that whole mindset around
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.840]   so that young people could start to say,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.400]   "It is a beautiful thing.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.520]   It is something I really aspire to,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.040]   to lay down my life and give myself in one place,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   to one people for one great, glorious, eternal cause."
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.560]   - Yes, amen.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.960]   And speaking of the Cross Conference,
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.800]   it all begins on December 27th in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.600]   And for more information about the conference online,
