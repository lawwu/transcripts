[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the verses 6 to 10 in the second
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.760]   chapter of this epistle of Paul to the Romans, which we are considering together. We are
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.960]   going to look this evening at verses 6 to 10 in the second chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:31.440]   to the Romans, who will render to every man according to his deeds, to them who by patient
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.960]   continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life. But unto
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.640]   them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.880]   and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of men that doeth evil, of the Jew first
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:06.480]   and also of the Gentile. But glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.280]   to the Jew first and also to the Gentile.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.040]   Now here the apostle, as you notice, takes another step forward in this argument that
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.180]   he is conducting primarily against the Jews, with whose position of course he was very
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.280]   familiar, having been in it once himself. But it's an argument, as I'm pointing out,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.960]   which not only applies to the Jews of those days, it applies to all others who adopt the
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.120]   same kind of attitude towards the pronouncements of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   Christ.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.080]   Now here he takes up the fourth argument. We've already looked at the first three.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.560]   The first is in the first verse, the second in the second, and then the third is that
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.920]   about the complete misunderstanding about the goodness of God, which they'd so completely
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.640]   misunderstood that they were really despising it. And, as he points out to them, the effect
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.480]   of that misunderstanding and that despising is that they are simply treasuring up unto
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:27.840]   themselves wrath against the day of wrath and the revelation of the righteous judgment
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.040]   of God. Now that isn't all, he says. There is a further argument, and this further argument
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.120]   arises out of the previous one. It is something that he's got to tell them about that day
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:53.440]   of the wrath of God and the revelation of his righteous judgment. And that is the thing
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.560]   which he now takes up. There are certain things which are going to be revealed in that judgment,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.200]   and it is because they are not clear about this. It's because they have completely misunderstood
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.520]   some of their own scriptures which he's going to quote to them, and are therefore so tragically
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.960]   ignorant as to what is going to be revealed when the righteous judgment of God is revealed,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.040]   that he takes this up with them so that they should be left without any argument whatsoever.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.680]   Their position is quite untenable. They're governed by a prejudice, they're not facing
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.480]   their own scriptures of which they boast so much. And so he goes on, point after point,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.560]   step after step, bringing home to them this thing which is uppermost in his mind, that
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.040]   they as Jews are as much under the wrath of God as anybody else, and that the only way
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.600]   of salvation for them as for everybody else is to believe in and to submit to and receive
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.280]   this righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   Now then, let's follow him as he takes up the argument. He's now going to show them,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.880]   I say, what will be revealed in this great day of judgment which we saw so clearly last
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.120]   time is coming. The first thing he tells them is this, that it is to be a judgment which
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.880]   will be upon all men. Now this is his primary point, and that is why you see in this paragraph
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.480]   that I've just read to you, he says that three times. First of all in verse 6, "who will
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.280]   render to every man according to his deeds." In verse 9, "tribulation and anguish upon
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.760]   every soul of men that doeth evil." Then in verse 10, "but glory, honor, and peace to
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:10.640]   every man that worketh good." Now, the apostle doesn't repeat a statement like that without
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.720]   of course having some very good reason for doing so. And as I say, this is the point
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.080]   that he's particularly anxious to bring home just in this connection. So let me divide
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.660]   it up like this. What he's asserting is that this great judgment which is coming will be
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:39.580]   an individual judgment. Every human being that has ever lived will appear in this judgment.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:49.000]   It is universal, and as I'm saying particularly, it is a personal and an individual judgment.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.840]   In other words, it's not a matter of nations. The world is not going to be judged at the
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:01.340]   end in nations at a time. Neither are we going to be judged as family. You see the importance
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.680]   of all this? There are many people who think they are going to heaven simply because they
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.960]   happen to have been born in a certain nation. Anybody born in this country, some still believe
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.920]   it. Anybody born in this country is a Christian. Then of course there are pagan nations, they're
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.560]   not. So they think that the mere fact of their nationality is going to take them into heaven.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.820]   The answer to that is this, everyone is going to be judged separately, individually and
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:34.300]   distinctly. Every soul of man, he says, and that's an important addition, just to emphasize
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.980]   again the particularity. And there are many undoubtedly who still think that they can
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.300]   go to heaven because they belong to a certain family. Many have tried to persuade themselves
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.480]   that you can ride into heaven on the back of a saintly father or mother or even grandfather
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.080]   or grandmother. But here's the answer, no, no, it's an individual judgment, not a familial
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   matter. You won't be admitted as families and anybody who's in the family goes in. Now
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.280]   that's the sort of thing the Jew believed. He believed that because he was a Jew he was
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.120]   outside this sort of thing. But it's individual. Now this is something that is taught everywhere
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:21.000]   in the Scripture. There are some who would have us believe that it is not taught in the
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.720]   twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, where our Lord, dealing with
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.480]   the final judgment, you remember, in his third picture in that great chapter, puts it like
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.160]   this in verse thirty-one, Matthew twenty-five, thirty-one, "When the Son of Man shall come
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.440]   in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:51.560]   his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations. And he shall separate them one
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.040]   from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.840]   on the right hand, but the goats on the left." Now there is a teaching with which no doubt
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:09.200]   many are familiar which says that this is the judgment of the nations and that the nations
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.980]   of the world are going to be judged as nations in that great day according to their treatment
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.760]   of the Jews. Well, to me the statement we are looking at together here this evening
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.280]   is more than a sufficient answer to that. Where the Apostle, as I am going to show you
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.500]   in my next pint, goes out of his way to say that there is no difference between the Jew
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.880]   and the Gentile. It is an individual judgment. Nowhere in the scripture apart from that one
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.640]   isolated passage there in Matthew twenty-five suggests that there is going to be any sort
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   of national judgment. Indeed the whole of the scripture is against it. And it is the
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.320]   simplest thing in the world, surely, with that paragraph in Matthew twenty-five beginning
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.720]   at verse thirty-one, to see that that is just a term. All the nations of the world, all
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.320]   the peoples. But from that point nation is not mentioned. He immediately goes on then
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.000]   to deal with these individuals who are going to be divided up as sheep and goats. There
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.160]   is nothing anywhere in the scripture to suggest that nations are going to be judged as nations
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.740]   and that the determining factor of their fate will be their treatment of the Jews. Now that
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.480]   matter of necessity arises at this point because the Apostle says that the judgment is going
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:35.080]   to be on every soul of men, not in blocks, not in groups, but individual and personal.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.920]   But not only is that important in terms of correct exposition of scripture, but let us
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:47.720]   all remember that it is something therefore that speaks to us. Go back again and read
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   Revelations twenty, and there you will find that the same thing is emphasized, that dead
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.780]   are all going to be judged. Those that are in the graves, those that are in the sea,
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:04.280]   it does not matter where they are, they will all arise and have to appear there and listen
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.200]   to this great sentence. Oh yes, believers as well as unbelievers. And it is because
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.800]   the believers are at that judgment that we are told that this second book appears, which
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.240]   is the book of life in which they are written and which will announce to them their glorious
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:26.900]   destiny. But they will have to appear in this great judgment. And therefore I say it is
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.880]   important for us always to remember that it is something which is individual and personal.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:40.800]   The second thing is that he says that there will be no distinctions recognized whatsoever.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.760]   Now you notice how the Apostle repeats himself for the sake of emphasis in verses nine and
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.040]   ten. Listen again. "Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of men that doeth evil, of
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.200]   the Jew first, and also of the Gentile." The Jews will not be in a special position.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.600]   That is the whole purpose of this argument. The Jews thought they were in a special position
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.080]   and that they would always remain in a special position. No, says the Apostle, this is a
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.560]   universal individual judgment for the Jew first and also for the Gentile. Then he goes
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.920]   on in verse ten. "But glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.200]   Jew first and also to the Gentile." Now the point there is that there is no difference
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.800]   whatsoever between the Jew and the Gentile. That's gone. And especially in this matter
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.880]   of judgment, it doesn't exist at all. So that indeed we can even go further and say
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:45.560]   this, that the Apostle says that far from escaping the judgment because he is a Jew,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.600]   the judgment really is going to come to the Jew first. There it is in the two verses,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:58.480]   nine and ten, to the Jew first and also of the Gentile, by which he surely means this.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:04.400]   That not only is the Jew not going to escape this judgment, the judgment is going to be
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.520]   particularly severe upon him because of all his advantages. Because he had the oracles
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.240]   of God, because he belonged to this nation that God had formed for himself, because of
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.960]   all the prophets and all the teaching, to the Jew first. Not only first in order, but
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:27.160]   first as it were in intensity, because of all the advantages that he had enjoyed. Here
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.400]   you see once more, we see the treachery of the human heart, the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   The Jews had actually twisted the Scriptures to say the exact opposite of what they rarely
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:45.680]   say. Not only, I say, are they to be judged, it is to the Jew first and also then to the
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:55.480]   Gentile. And I want to apply this to ourselves because as we've seen already many times,
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.520]   there are many, it seems to me, in the Christian Church today in the precise position of these
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.800]   Jews in the time of Paul and of our Lord. They are relying on the fact that because
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.000]   they were born to Christian parents, because they've always gone to a place of worship
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.040]   and were admitted into membership at a certain age, they're relying on that alone as proof
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.040]   of the fact that they're Christians. They have no experience, they often don't know
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.760]   what they believe. They're relying simply upon Church membership or some accident of
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.320]   birth or of upbringing. And you see it is to such people that the Apostle Peter in his
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.560]   first epistle in the fourth chapter and the seventeenth verse says this, "Judgment must
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:44.880]   begin at the house of God." As it's right to say to the Jew first, it is equally right
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.440]   to say to the house of God first. There is no question about this. The judgment will
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.640]   begin amongst those who make a profession. There are many instances of that in the Scriptures
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.520]   and I shall probably be quoting them later. But the general message I say then at this
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.200]   point is this, that as the Jew couldn't rely upon his nationality or his privileged
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:14.680]   position, so we must rely upon none of these external things. We shall not be judged in
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:22.200]   churches or in groups in any sense. There is no privileged position. Every one will
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:29.040]   have to stand on his own and he will have to face the same judgment. Very well, that's
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:37.000]   the first thing, but let me go on to the second. The second statement is that this judgment
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:46.400]   will be according to our deeds. Now that's verse six, "who will render to every man
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:57.760]   according to his deeds," or if you like, his works. Now the Apostle there is incidentally
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:04.800]   displaying his brilliance as a debater and as an arguer, because what he says there is
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:12.600]   nothing but a quotation from Psalm 62, verse 12. It's also an exact quotation of Proverbs
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.200]   chapter 24, verse 12. And there are other passages which say the same thing in slightly
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.780]   different words. But it's a direct quotation from Psalm 62, 12 and Proverbs 24, 12. So
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.520]   you see the brilliance of the argument as he conducts it. He's quoting the Scriptures
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.040]   of which they boasted to them. And the Scriptures which they rely upon say that God will judge
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:42.440]   every man in this great judgment according to his deeds.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:50.200]   Now this is one of these very important statements. It's a statement that has been very, very
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.520]   frequently misunderstood. I once heard a man expounding these very verses we're looking
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.080]   at now, and his teaching was that there were some people who were going to be justified
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.920]   by works after all. There you see is the danger. Here is a categorical statement who will judge
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.600]   every man according to his deeds. Now then, how do we interpret this? Well, the best way
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.960]   to approach a difficult passage always is to take it, I think, like this. First of all,
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:23.280]   let's take the exact statement which the Apostle makes. Before we jump to any conclusions,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.800]   before we begin to argue, let's note his particular statements. Then, having got them
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.520]   perfectly clear and having discovered what exactly he says, we can then see how it fits
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:44.000]   into his major argument. Very well, let's look at it like this. What does the Apostle
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.120]   mean exactly when he says that every man is going to be judged according to his deeds?
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:56.800]   Well, what he goes on to say is this. There will be two groups of people, he says. Two
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:06.960]   groups. The righteous and the unrighteous. And their fates will correspondingly be different.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.640]   There is a fate which awaits the righteous; there is a fate which awaits the unrighteous.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:21.440]   Then, you notice that he goes on to say that each of these two types can be described in
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:28.760]   detail. And he describes each one of them in a three-fold manner. So that as we listen
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.080]   to what he's saying, we are in a perfect position to be able to examine ourselves and
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.600]   to judge ourselves. Here we are, we know that we've got to stand in that great judgment
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.200]   before God. We know we're going to belong to either that position or this position.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.760]   Well, there is nothing more important in the world for us tonight than to know which of
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.680]   these two groups we belong to. The Apostle, I say very fortunately, gives us a three-fold
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:59.280]   division of each of the groups. And you notice he makes the same points about the three.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:08.640]   First of all, he considers the general attitude of the two groups to God and to the things
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:16.920]   of God in general. Secondly, he examines them in terms of the general bent or tenor of their
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:24.320]   life and living. And thirdly, he examines them in terms of their actual conduct and
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:30.720]   behavior. Now then, let's have a look at the two groups. The righteous group, the unrighteous
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.600]   group. I've got three things to discover about the righteous, three things to discover
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.320]   about the unrighteous. The same three points of examination, but we'll see where they
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:46.520]   differ. Now then, looking at the righteous, first of all, what is the attitude of this
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:54.560]   person towards God and the things of God? Well, here is the answer. He is a person who
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.760]   is seeking for glory and honor and immortality. You find that in verse 7. "To them who by
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:10.600]   patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality." That's
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.920]   their general attitude. What does he mean by this? Am I seeking for glory and honor
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:25.160]   and immortality? What does he mean by glory? Well, he means by glory, of course, everything
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:37.280]   that God himself is and represents, and everything that God has for his own people. Oh, how often
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:46.360]   is that term used for it in the scripture. We read about the glory of God being manifested.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:53.120]   You know, the old theologians of three and four hundred years ago used to say that the
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:20:02.480]   thing which makes God God is his glory. Everything else that is true of God, all his attributes,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:11.800]   are summed up in his glory, the glory of God. Now then, what we are told about these people
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:19.400]   is that they desire to be with God and to behold his glory and to spend their eternity
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.680]   in his glory. Now the apostle is very interested in this idea. If you go on to the fifth chapter
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.160]   and the second verse, you'll find he says this, that because we are justified by faith,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:35.080]   we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:45.840]   into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. That's the
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:53.600]   characteristic of this man's attitude. This is the thing that he's looking forward to.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.560]   He has an understanding concerning God and his being and his nature, and this is the
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:04.280]   supreme thing in his life, to know God, to be like God, and to spend his eternity in
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:11.840]   the glorious presence of God. He is seeking this glory. It's the same thing as the apostle
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.880]   says in the eighth chapter of this great epistle when he says, "Whom he called them, he also
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:25.720]   justified, and whom he justified them, he also glorified." You see, our final salvation
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.480]   is our glorification. Christ is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:38.200]   and redemption. Now in that redemption is this final glorification. Take what's going
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.320]   to happen to my body. When the Lord Jesus Christ comes back, he will change this, the
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:50.860]   body of my humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto the body of his glorification. My
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:57.040]   body is going to be glorified as well as my spirit. I will be altogether glorious, sharing
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:04.780]   something of the glory of God and spending my eternity in his glorious presence. These
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.560]   people seek for that glory.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:14.660]   The second thing is honor. What does this mean? Well, this means, of course, the honor
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:26.760]   that God gives us. God, as it were, honors us, and he distinguishes us from others, and
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.500]   he places an honor and a dignity upon us. Now, the best commentary on this is a word
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:38.860]   of our Lord himself, which you'll find in John 5, verse 44. He turned to those Jews
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:46.880]   and he said, "How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:54.320]   the honor that cometh from God only?" You see what an important statement that is. He
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.880]   said to those Jews, "You know, the real trouble with you is not your intellects, it's
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.480]   this. You're seeking honor from one another. You want to be great in this world and want
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.420]   to have honor from men, and you're getting it, and that's all you do get. But because
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:12.040]   you're so intent on that, you never seek for the honor that can come from God alone,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:21.020]   which God alone can give. But these people are seeking that. They don't care very much
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:29.680]   what the world thinks of them. Let the world deride or pity. I will glory in thy name,
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:37.600]   say these people. Destitute, despised, forsaken, thou from hence my all shalt be. That's
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.160]   the honor these people are after, not the human honors, not the honors that the papers
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.560]   make so much of, and the world with all its boasting makes so much of, an honor that's
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.820]   going to disappear, the honor that that man dives his head with his sumptuous clothing
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:57.640]   and his great feasts, and all the rest of it. No, no. These people were not known by
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:03.720]   the world, and the world didn't respect them nor honor them, but God did. And that
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.960]   was the only thing that mattered with them, the honor that cometh from God only.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   And then the third thing is immortality, which can also be translated as incorruptibility.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:23.520]   This means, of course, the absence of decay of any kind. It means to be in a condition
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:32.000]   in which nothing harmful can happen, in which no injury can take place to you at all. Incorruptible.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.680]   Nothing can defile it. You remember how the Apostle Peter, again in his first epistle
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.760]   in the first chapter, somewhere about verse four or five, puts it again, "Blessed be
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.040]   the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that hath begotten us again into a lively
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.240]   hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." To what? To our inheritance.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:56.680]   Incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away. There it is. It's there everywhere.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:03.080]   Or listen to Paul saying it in the great 15th chapter of 1 Corinthians, "Then the trumpet
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:10.880]   shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:18.000]   must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality." That's it.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.840]   So these people, he says, are seeking that. They're seeking glory. They're seeking the
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.920]   honor that God alone can give. And they're looking forward to this state of incorruptibility.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.880]   And do you remember this great Apostle Paul, the Apostle of Faith, writing to the Galatians
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:46.280]   says, "In due season we shall reap, if we faint not." But if you faint, you won't reap.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.440]   So therefore, you see, there are these great exhortations, I say, to patient continuance.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.240]   Now he doesn't mean by all this that they never fall. He doesn't mean they're sinless.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.400]   He doesn't mean that they're perfect. If I may borrow a great statement out of the Old
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:09.640]   Testament, the position is this. Faint yet pursuing. Still going on, stumbling at times,
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:16.960]   but going on by patient continuance in well doing. They keep on fighting the good fight
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.000]   of faith. They're not these giddy people who say they never have any temptations or problems,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.520]   and now I am happy all the day. Not at all. They say it's a struggle and a fight. I go
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.480]   on patiently with great endurance. Sometimes I wonder what's happening to me. But patient
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:41.600]   continuance in well doing. That's the statement. Very well, my friends, let's test ourselves.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.440]   Then we come to the third test, which is their actual conduct. And what he says about them
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:56.480]   here I find in verse 10. "But glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good."
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:04.120]   There you are right down to the particulars. We've seen their general attitude, we've
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.760]   seen the general tenor of their living, and here in actual practice they're living a
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:17.200]   good life, they're doing good. This means, of course, that they're doing their utmost
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:23.680]   to keep the commandments. "Hereby," says John in his first epistle, "hereby we do
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:31.920]   know that we know him if we keep his commandments." This righteous man doesn't abide in sin.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.960]   He doesn't go on sinning. He falls, but he doesn't abide in it. It isn't a life
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.440]   of sin. No, no, he's living a life of goodness, a life of righteousness. He may fall, but
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:48.920]   this is the general way of his life. He's keeping the commandments. He's doing good.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:54.800]   Well, there is the description of the righteous. Let me show you the condition of the unrighteous,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:02.120]   which of course is the exact opposite. What is the general attitude of the unrighteous?
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:10.040]   The apostle puts it in one word, in the eighth verse. "But unto them that are contentious."
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:19.880]   Contentious. What's he mean by this? Well, he means, if you like, factious. This means,
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.120]   of course, simply malicious opposition to God. The first man, you see, is always waiting
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.420]   upon God. He's reading his word. He wants to know God. He attends upon God. He prays
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.760]   to God. Nothing is greater in this man's life than this desire to know God and this
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:43.080]   glory and honor. This other man, when God speaks to him, he doesn't agree with him.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:50.280]   He contends with God. He's contentious. He's factious. You see, he sets up his opinions
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.240]   against God's opinion. He knows what God's going to tell him, but he doesn't want to
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.040]   do that. He wants to live another kind of life. He's self-centered, puts himself up
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.520]   in the center, and therefore he argues with God. Well, it's all there in the third chapter
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:11.840]   of Genesis, isn't it? It was the very thing, you see, that the devil persuaded Eve to do.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.760]   He came to her and said, "Hath God said? Is it right for God?" That's contention.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   You're querying God, and you're querying God's rightness and his justice and his truth,
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.400]   and you're contending with him. Ah, is that the right way, or isn't it? Now, there is
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.040]   a perfect description, isn't it, of all who are outside Christ tonight. They're arguing
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.720]   with this book. They're expurgating the book. They're taking sections. They don't agree
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.360]   with this teaching about the wrath of God or something else. They're contending. They're
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:50.100]   contentious. They defy God, and they thus, in their arrogance, set up their own opinions
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.680]   against his. In other words, they are men of the world instead of men of God. They're
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   governed by the outlook of this world. Paul puts it so perfectly in Ephesians 2, the first
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:09.160]   three verses, wherein in time past we all walked according to the course of this world.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.000]   And all the people in this world tonight are walking according to the course of this world,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.920]   according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.360]   of disobedience. They're all great critics of the Bible. They're all great critics of
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.840]   the Christian life. Ha! They say, "Your life, it's so narrow." They can't abide it. They
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.440]   don't agree with it. That isn't their idea of it. They're contentious. And they show
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.840]   their teeth to you. If you begin to talk about godliness, contentious, what a perfect description
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.520]   of them. They betray what they are by their general attitude. But what about the general
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:53.040]   tenor of their life? Well, here it is again. "But unto them that are contentious, and do
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:31:00.640]   not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness." There they are. They do not obey the truth,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:09.360]   but they do obey unrighteousness. In other words, they don't live according to God's
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.840]   law. How do they live? Well, go back again to Ephesians 2, 3, wherein in time past we
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:23.800]   all had our conversation. "Fulfilling," he says, "the lusts of the flesh." According
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:33.280]   to the lusts of the flesh. Fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind. And
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.400]   we're all by nature the children of wrath, even as others. That's how the children of
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:46.320]   wrath ever live. The lusts of the flesh, the desire of the flesh and of the mind. The apostle
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.360]   is really repeating what he'd said in verse 18 of the first chapter, isn't he? Where he
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.800]   talked about these people who are guilty of ungodliness and unrighteousness. The ungodliness
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:04.960]   comes in this contentious spirit and the unrighteousness follows inevitably. That is the general tenor
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:10.560]   of their life. They come to the law of God and they don't obey it. Then they listen
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.960]   to the enticements of the world and the flesh and the devil and they do obey it. That's
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.440]   the thing they're giving obedience to. The thing they read about in their papers and
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.200]   they see on their films. The things that are always blared out of the wireless. The way
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.600]   of the world. That's it. Unrighteousness. And they obey it and they go after it. And
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   they spend their money in doing so and they enjoy it. That's the general tenor of their
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:41.280]   life. And then with regard to their actual conduct, you see, he again puts it in a single
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:51.400]   phrase in the ninth verse, "Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of men that doeth
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:33:00.520]   evil." He rather likes that phrase, this apostle does. In Galatians 5, he talks about
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:09.640]   the works of the flesh. You read his list. The works of the flesh. Fornication, adultery,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:18.320]   envy, blasphemy, evil surmisings, all those horrible things. There they are. They do evil.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:27.560]   As the other men were so absolutely different. And this in turn brings us to the third thing
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:33.760]   that the apostle tells us here will be revealed in this great judgment. It's a judgment on
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:43.120]   all men individually. It's a judgment according to deeds. And at the same time this great
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:50.000]   day will announce one of two destinies for everybody. And the destinies will correspond
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.280]   to the type of life that we've just been looking at. For the righteous, he says, it is eternal
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:02.200]   life. To go on to this endless eternal life. We can have it here, we begin it here, but
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.480]   there we'll enter into it in its all, its glory and its fullness. To be forever with
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:14.880]   the Lord, ever in the presence of God, blessed of the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.160]   Eternal life. And it's everlasting. You remember? It was incorruption they were looking for.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.000]   It was incorruptibility. It was immortality. There'll never be anything that will come
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.720]   in by way of death. So it goes on forever and forever and forever. It is eternal as
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:37.880]   God is eternal. Everlasting or eternal life. That's the thing that they will hear announced
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:45.320]   with respect to them. God will render that to them. What of the others?
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.560]   Now the learned commentators very rightly point out here that there's a change in the
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:55.760]   construction which brings out the idea that what we're going to be told about the unrighteous
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:03.240]   is not rendered unto them, but it just happens to them. This is not a gift of God which I'm
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:09.120]   going to tell you about now, it's the inevitable consequence of what they've been. He doesn't
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.400]   render it to them, but it happens to them. What is it that happens to them? Well here
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:22.040]   it is, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish. You notice he's saying two
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:28.520]   things there. First of all, he tells them of God's attitude towards them. And God's
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:37.860]   attitude is one of settled wrath. They're always under the wrath of God. God's wrath
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:46.280]   is ever upon them. The wrath of God, as we read in John 3, in that last verse, abideth
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:51.920]   upon them. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:59.880]   the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. It was there, it remains
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:07.280]   there. That's it. That's the wrath of God. God's hatred of evil and of sin. God's
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:15.000]   attitude of abhorrence towards it. That will abide. Yes, but you see, it's not only wrath,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.880]   he says, but indignation also. What is this? Well, indignation, if you like, is the manifestation
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:33.080]   of this attitude of God towards sin. God's attitude towards all sin at this moment is
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:39.000]   one of wrath. But what we are told here is this, as we are told elsewhere, that at that
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.400]   great day of judgment, God's wrath will manifest itself. It will unfold itself. It
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:55.160]   will pour itself out. That's what the indignation means. It's a most terrible and a tremendous
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.680]   thought. It's this which Paul puts in the second epistle to the Thessalonians in the
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:10.240]   first chapter, verses 7-10. Listen to this. "To you who are troubled there will come,
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:16.080]   he says at that day, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:26.360]   his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God and that
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:34.160]   obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction."
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:41.360]   My dear friends, this is something so tremendous and so terrible. The wrath of God is upon
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:50.400]   sin now. At that day it will be revealed. It will be manifest. The wrath will come to
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:38:00.040]   expression. And what will be that expression? Well, he puts it in two words, "tribulation
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   and anguish." What do they mean? Well, tribulation means trouble. It means affliction.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.640]   It means pressure. The derivation, the origin of the word is this. In the old days, you
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.600]   know, when they wanted to get the wheat germ out of the wheat that they'd gathered, they
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:24.720]   used to put the wheat on a floor, and then they had great flails, and they used to hit
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.680]   the wheat with the flails, and thus they'd separate the chaff from the wheat. And in
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.840]   so doing, they were, as it were, bruising it. They used the tribulum, and hence the
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.680]   term "tribulation." As if you are being struck. We talk about that, don't we? We
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:47.680]   talk about being struck by misfortune, being beaten and battered and bruised by the things
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.280]   that happen to us in this life. Well, that's what's going to happen to these people to
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:39:00.440]   all eternity. Tribulation. This tremendous kind of beating and bruising. And that leads
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:10.480]   to anguish. And what a word is anguish. It means a kind of suffering in spirit. It means
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.320]   suffering as the consequence of the tribulation. Now, in a very interesting way, the apostle
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:21.200]   brings these two words together in 2 Corinthians 4, verse 8, where he says this, "We are
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:28.240]   troubled on every side, yet not distressed." Now, the two words he used were these, "We
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.120]   are in tribulation on every side, yet we are not in anguish." They are the identical
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.920]   words that are used here. So you can have tribulation, you see, without knowing the
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:43.000]   anguish. And if you're a true Christian, though you pass through tribulation, you're
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:51.360]   never in anguish. We are troubled on every side, yet we are not distressed. But these
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:59.320]   poor wretches, consigned to hell on that great day of judgment, will not only have the tribulation,
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:05.840]   but they'll have the anguish. And I've already read to you out of that 16th chapter
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:13.080]   of Luke exactly what the anguish means. "Diavis awakens in hell in the torment of the flame
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:18.880]   and pleads with Abram to send down Lazarus to relieve him. This torment, he says, that
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:26.400]   I'm enduring, it's our Lord who spoke those words, not me." And again he talks about
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:33.640]   that place in which there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. That's anguish. Intense
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:40.920]   suffering in spirit, and in mind, and in heart, endless eternal remorse, a realization of
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:51.600]   your folly, but it's too late. And enduring that, that's anguish, tribulation and anguish.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:59.040]   You see, that isn't life, is it? But it is existence. And what the apostle says is
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:05.920]   this, that the righteous go on to eternal life, but these go on to this existence of
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:12.600]   this type, and as that was everlasting, this is everlasting. My dear friends, if the Bible
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:18.080]   didn't teach this kind of thing, I would not dare to utter it. I know that every natural
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.480]   man in the world hates this and abominates it. I know there are thousands who don't
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:29.120]   go to places of worship because of this teaching. They're contentious, you see. And I wouldn't
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:34.600]   dare nor venture to assert it if it wasn't here everywhere in the scriptures from the
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:42.440]   lips of the Son of God himself, the incarnation of God's love. Gnashing, weeping, and gnashing
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:49.920]   of teeth divies the rich men in the flame and in the torment. Yes, the Bible teaches
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:42:00.360]   that this is going to happen. There's not a word in the Bible about a second chance.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:07.920]   What Paul teaches here is this, that we are going to be judged according to our deeds.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:16.240]   The deeds which we work here and now. It is what you and I do in this life and in this
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:22.800]   world that determines our eternal destiny. There is no second chance, no second opportunity
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:30.480]   taught in the scripture. Neither does the Apostle say here that it's only going to
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.560]   be for a limited period of time, that they're going to have tribulation and anguish, perhaps
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.780]   for a year or two, or perhaps for a century or two, perhaps for a millennium or two, and
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:45.280]   then they'll be annihilated and cease to exist. There's no conditional immortality
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:52.360]   in the New Testament. He just says that as the one group go to eternal everlasting life,
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:58.800]   his others go to tribulation and anguish. They'll exist in that condition, and he
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:05.960]   doesn't suggest any end to it. Neither does the scripture anywhere else. Everlasting
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:12.920]   destruction you noticed in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 just now. Well, my friends, there
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:20.640]   it is. The most solemn, the most momentous, the most tremendous thing that a body of men
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:27.560]   and women can ever consider together. But that is what we are solemnly told will be
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:35.080]   revealed on the great day of judgment. We shall all be standing there. We shall all
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:46.840]   be judged according to our deeds, and we shall all go to one or the other of the two fates.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:55.800]   Are you seeking glory and honor and immortality? Can you say of yourself that you're continuing
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:05.840]   patiently in well-doing? And that your greatest desire, indeed, can you say that you're
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   hungering and thirsting after righteousness? If you are, and if you can, I assure you that
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:24.840]   the verdict you will hear will be eternal life. But if not, there remains nothing but
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:33.120]   that other terrible, awful, awe-inspiring picture. Let's not only think about ourselves.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:40.320]   Let's think of the teeming masses around us and in the world who are contentious and
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:51.360]   who are not obeying the truth but are obeying unrighteousness. Let us realize their fate.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:58.160]   That will bring home to us our responsibility for them. That is what will lead us to prayer,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:04.320]   to pray for revival, the power of God. That will lead us to speak to them, do all we can
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:13.120]   to enlighten them, as God will enable us. Let us therefore solemnly meditate deeply
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:20.440]   and continually upon these things. Let us pray.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:29.080]   Our heavenly Father, we come again before thee, and more than ever in our lives we thank
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:42.240]   thee for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of our souls. O God, we pray thee
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:49.280]   again to enable us to realize what he has done for us, that he has saved us from the
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:46:01.480]   wrath to come and has given us this gift and promise of eternal life. Lord, open our eyes
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:08.920]   and give us an ever deeper understanding, give us a love and a compassion for souls.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:14.720]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:22.640]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.840]   Amen.
