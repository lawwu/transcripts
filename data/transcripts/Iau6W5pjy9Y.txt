[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   The following is a conversation with RZA,
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.720]   the rapper, record producer, filmmaker, actor, writer,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.680]   philosopher, kung fu scholar, and the mastermind
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.880]   of the legendary hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.240]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.440]   in the description.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.620]   And now, here's my conversation with RZA.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.160]   In the Tao of Wu, you write,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.440]   "When my mother left the physical world,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.560]   "I lost one of my main links to the universe."
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.280]   They say that you have an umbilical cord
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.200]   and an etheric cord, which is the invisible cord
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.160]   that attaches you to your soul,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.260]   your mother's soul, and all other souls.
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.480]   When one passes away, you really lose something.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.360]   It's physical and mental.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.520]   It's real.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.680]   Part of you dies.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.980]   What have you learned about life from your mother?
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   I mean, I learned life itself from my mother.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.680]   You know, being one of 11 children
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.000]   and seeing the sacrifice that she gave to us,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.120]   therefore given to life,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.480]   it's really the greatest lesson of life.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.280]   The thing that shook me as I wrote those words
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.460]   was coming up young with arrogance, confidence,
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.220]   knowledge of myself.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.980]   They called me the scientist.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.260]   We was taught you're the supreme being.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.660]   In order to be the supreme being,
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.680]   you gotta be supreme amongst other beings.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.100]   I understand that more now than I did then
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.000]   because then it was so literal.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   The word God derived basically from the Greek language,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.920]   as they say, and it meant wisdom, strength, and beauty.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.120]   Yeah, we could have that,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.720]   but the power to control life and death
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.220]   is something that you would assume is a God trait.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.160]   So now here you are saying that you're a God, right?
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.400]   And you're reading the Bible
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.620]   how Jesus brought back Lazarus.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.420]   And now it's your turn to do something.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.320]   And when my mother was laying there in the hospital bed,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.760]   and air was no longer coming out of her lungs
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.240]   and going into her lungs,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.000]   where's my power to bring her back to life?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.720]   - So you can't truly be God.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.320]   You're powerless.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.920]   - Yeah, or God is not the definition
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.720]   that we need to use to describe it
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.640]   because it's a translation of wisdom, strength, and beauty.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.720]   So you could be that.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.480]   So I'm answering your question,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.960]   what did my mother teach me about life?
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.880]   I learned that day on her physical passing,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.760]   that okay, there's a physical me.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   - Do you think about her?
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.120]   Do you miss her?
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.720]   - Of course.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.560]   I keep my mother in my prayer every day.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.960]   And the thing I pray the most
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.760]   beyond giving thanks is I pray that her name
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.240]   is honored and remembered by my family.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.640]   I don't know if the world's gonna remember it, right?
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.000]   Even though if you watch my movie, "Love Beats Rhymes,"
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.280]   I named the school in that movie
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   after my mother just to leave it somewhere else.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   - Yeah, in physical space, yeah.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.720]   But yeah, painful.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.880]   The pain of my mother's passing is indescribable.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.360]   Only until it happens to a person they know,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.880]   and then they won't describe it either.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.560]   Only the people that lost their mother,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.840]   they could look at each other and they got this nod.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.680]   But one other thing happened to me
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.600]   was the joy of life hit me differently.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.840]   And I think it was the realization of my own mortality
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.720]   versus my immortality.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.600]   It's a big, big thing.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.040]   And I don't know if we'll get to expound on that,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.720]   but there was a joy that overcame me
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.400]   because I was kind of free of a certain illusion
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.360]   about the immortality of my physical being
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.080]   versus the mortality of my physical being.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.120]   And I was like, okay, wow, I understand.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.800]   - So that was the first or the hardest realization
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   you've experienced that you're mortal?
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.840]   - Yeah, and I'll say mortal
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.360]   and what you're looking at here physically.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.480]   I wouldn't say my soul is mortal.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.240]   I would say it's immortal because at the end of the day,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.840]   it's just like I could sit here
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.720]   and I could just hum, please, please, please, by James Brown.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.520]   But James Brown is not gonna come in here and do that.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.360]   - So in some sense, James Brown is still here.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.200]   In another sense, he's gone.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.400]   - The soul is here.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.240]   - The soul.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.400]   - The soul is here.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.560]   - Well, it lives through you by you singing it.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.800]   It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   And the hope is that the human species continues
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.880]   to celebrate the great minds
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.840]   and the great creations of the past.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.640]   - I would add this to that equation.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.000]   When I say it's immortal,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.320]   I don't think not just only because somebody sings it.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.040]   It's like, where's the fire at right now?
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   It's in the air.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.240]   You just gotta spark the spark.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.840]   (laughing)
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.760]   - Yeah.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.160]   - So it's always there.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.280]   - Are you afraid of death?
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.960]   - No, I'm not afraid of death.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.200]   I'm not trying to see it.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.800]   I'm not rushing that nowhere near me.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.880]   Because all I know is life.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.080]   My life is living.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.400]   I read a lot of ancient texts.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   People probably know about me.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.000]   I love one of the great teachers named Bodhidharma.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And there was a thing written in one of the books of his,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.800]   or one of the teachings of his.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   And the question, somebody asked him a similar question.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.640]   You're scared of death?
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.440]   Or what are you gonna be after you die?
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   And his answer was, I don't know.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.720]   He had answers to everything.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.560]   But he's like, I don't know.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.520]   They said, oh, he doesn't know that.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.280]   He said, yeah, because I haven't died yet.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.240]   - Yeah.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.040]   Well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.000]   Not knowing what's on the other side of the door.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.080]   - Yeah.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.400]   I mean, especially when you're young.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   As a kid, fear permeated my life.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.320]   I was actually watching horror movies.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.680]   And I believe in all type of supernatural things
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.000]   that could or can happen.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.400]   I thought I saw things as well.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.960]   And whether it was being projected from my own mind
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.560]   or whether it was there visible to me, I don't know.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.280]   But life is beautiful.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.160]   And we have it.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.840]   And we should use it all the way to the last drop.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.800]   - Realizing the mortality,
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.880]   the gift your mother gave to you is realizing the immortal.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.600]   And in so doing, help you realize that life is beautiful.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.840]   - Yeah.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.640]   - On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read, said to ODB and you,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.360]   when it rains, get wet.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.960]   What do these words mean to you?
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.080]   - Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.160]   you know, I think I was more conservative,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.840]   like as a person.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.320]   And like, you know, had money.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.480]   Women wanted me.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.320]   - Yeah.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.880]   - Anything I kind of wanted,
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.240]   I probably could have had, you know what I mean?
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.920]   And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet, enjoy this.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.400]   Man, it's raining on you.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.560]   Don't pick up the umbrella.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.400]   Don't go back in the house.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.240]   - Yeah.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.080]   - Get wet.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.120]   - Experience the moment.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.480]   - Yeah. And enjoy it.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.600]   And I didn't take total heed to him at that time.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.360]   A couple of years later, I took some heed.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.000]   But at that time I didn't take heed.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.440]   And when I took heed,
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.960]   I think that I may have misinterpreted
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.200]   by looking at his example of getting wet
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.120]   versus my example of getting wet.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.560]   And I can tell you right now,
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.160]   I'm getting wet right now in my way.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.520]   - In part, thanks to your mother.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.600]   But overall, you just learned how to appreciate the rain.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.760]   Just like the experience of every moment.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.840]   - Yeah. And I'll share this with you
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.480]   'cause this is gonna be a very open conversation
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.960]   and I haven't had this conversation.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.760]   So definitely in part to my mother,
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.080]   then in part to my wife.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.560]   I meet my wife, it's my second wife,
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.360]   but I met her after my mother passed.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.920]   And she was just a friend.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.120]   You know, some girl I met, thought she was beautiful
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.320]   and actually built a friendship with her.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.360]   But a few years later when the relationship became like,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.680]   you know, this is gonna be my woman,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.040]   it was actually when I was doing the middle of my divorce
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.680]   and I was like, you know, do I run wild and hey, hey, hey,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.880]   you know, me and my wife already filed, we were separated.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.280]   And do I run wild?
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.160]   And I didn't run wild a little bit, but not too wild.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.520]   Right?
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.360]   And you know, I'm still a man, I'm a hip hop guy.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.640]   - I read you know how to party.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.880]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   But the funny thing is that my wife now, her name is Talani,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.440]   my uncle said she reminds me of your mother.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.960]   He knew my mother when, before I knew my mother.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.720]   And he saw that and we ended up dating,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.560]   got engaged and then her mother passes.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.680]   And so now there's a total understanding of everything
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.600]   and we actually helped build each other back up.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.340]   So of course I have to thank my mother for the awareness.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.800]   Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   to actualization, like to actually feel,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.560]   I don't think I'd be talking to you right now
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.760]   and talking as much as I do these days
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.000]   if it wasn't for the security and peace and harmony
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.040]   that I was able to gain at home.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.600]   You know, so.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.920]   - And like you said, you now share that look
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.520]   of having both lost your mom.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.320]   What have you learned from Quincy about music,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.940]   about business, about life?
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:23.920]   - Quincy Jones is a great mind, a great artist,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.100]   you know, a treasure in all reality.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.720]   He seen it from when it was, he couldn't walk in this,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.000]   he couldn't eat in the same places he played his music at
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.840]   to owning places bigger than ours.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.640]   So what a beautiful life, you know?
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.460]   He's the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him,
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.840]   you got a lifetime of information.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.960]   And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.760]   and days with him and, you know,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.000]   there's a certain period of time
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.440]   where we came across each other
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.520]   and he was always there to share the knowledge.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.760]   Like that's another thing about him that I think is special.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.000]   And hopefully I picked that up is that
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.220]   he's always willing to share,
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.080]   share with his experience, his knowledge.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   I mean, I think he'll even share his home
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.120]   to the right person if he feels that
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.880]   that's what they need to get back on their feet.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   He's a very beautiful man.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.000]   - So just the kindness, the goodness of the man
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.800]   is like the thing that really rubbed off on you.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.200]   - Yeah, I mean, minimum, right?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.780]   I mean, Quincy Jones also in his fifties,
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.580]   as a producer produced one of the greatest albums
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.400]   of all time and one of the greatest selling albums
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.720]   of all time, not just great critically,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.740]   economically great.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.520]   And I mean, he made, I think he did it
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.720]   at the age I am right now.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.620]   So I might have a great year coming up.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.880]   (laughing)
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.380]   - Time it well, yeah.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.160]   So now you got a taste of what greatness is.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.700]   You get to see what greatness is.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.500]   So you know what--
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.660]   - Exactly, how to strive for yourself, yeah.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.580]   - You've have a few people you've worked with
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.940]   who are fascinating like yourself, Quentin Tarantino.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.940]   You worked with him.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.380]   When somebody asked you to describe him with one word,
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.480]   you said encyclopedia.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.940]   What have you learned from the guy?
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.700]   About filmmaking, about life again.
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.020]   - A very generous man with his knowledge.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.700]   And for me, he shared it, I think in a way
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.720]   that was unique in a sense of,
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.820]   no at a point in time, we just was super duper tight.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.260]   Like I'm going to his crib and watching movies
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.900]   and just having long conversations about art
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.460]   and about life.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.980]   So I learned a lot.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.860]   I consider him, especially when it comes
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.580]   to anything cinematic in my life,
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.340]   I consider him the godfather of that for me.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:01.340]   I think, I humbly asked him to mentor me,
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.580]   which is a very humbling thing to do
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.220]   coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am,
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.980]   coming from, I was already a multi-platinum artist.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:16.120]   I mean, it was past the year 2000 already.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.200]   So like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.580]   So I was the wizard already, you know what I mean?
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.420]   But I humbled myself because I saw in him
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.420]   a craft of brain power that to me resonated with me,
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.580]   but I was just a Patamon at it.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.820]   I was a novice at it
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.220]   because I was trying to make movies in my music,
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.220]   you know, trying to make videos.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.280]   And here was a man who was a master of it
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.740]   and an encyclopedia of it as well.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.520]   And-- - Like film history.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.240]   - Film history from whether it's the actor,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.660]   the director, the cinematographer,
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.500]   maybe even the costume designer.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.280]   He may know 50, 60,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.440]   he may know the 50 greatest costume designers in his memory.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.380]   Yeah, I mean, this guy's brain.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.140]   - Both of you have pretty good memory.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.680]   (both laughing)
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.440]   - I'd love to be a fly on the wall in that conversation.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.560]   - Yeah, and kung fu movies mostly, I guess.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.240]   - We actually started,
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.720]   I think we started our relationship
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.560]   trying to outdo each other.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.860]   - Knowledge-wise or what?
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.880]   - Yeah, movie knowledge-wise.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.280]   Actually, kung fu movie knowledge-wise.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.360]   And I think that category,
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.840]   if it wasn't another category, I wouldn't have had a chance,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.260]   but at least in that category,
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.200]   I was pretty holding my weight.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.220]   - Who won?
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.460]   - You know what?
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.080]   I'll be honest and say that I may have said a few,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.920]   he didn't see, but Quentin is older than me.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.360]   So he could go back.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.200]   - Farther.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.280]   - Yeah, he could go back to 72,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.960]   when I didn't see one yet, you know what I mean?
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.800]   - Yeah.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.640]   - Yeah.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.080]   - Well, he said "Master of the Flying Guillotine"
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.800]   that I got a chance to,
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.160]   that you commentate over today,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.200]   and I got a chance to see the screening of.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.640]   He said that's one of his favorites.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.000]   For you, the 36 Chamber of Shaolin,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.120]   the Master Killer is your favorite.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.920]   Best ever, would you say?
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   That's the greatest Kung Fu movie ever?
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.120]   - It's hard to say the greatest ever, right?
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.160]   Because somebody may make another one,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.600]   and it depends on your own phase of life,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   but I will put that first.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.240]   If I want to introduce somebody to Kung Fu movies,
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.360]   that's a beautiful entry.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.040]   - You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.320]   What kind of wisdom do you draw from Kung Fu movies?
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.160]   You know what?
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.520]   The martial art itself and the movies.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.760]   - It's endless wisdom to be drawn, and I draw it.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.600]   You know?
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.560]   I draw it in a way, you know,
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.480]   that I could decipher it in my own life.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.480]   So, for instance, in the movie "Master Killer,"
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.040]   he basically, when he does Kung Fu,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.000]   he does a really, a style called the Hung Gar technique.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.960]   And the director of the movie is actually a Hung Gar expert
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.800]   who has a lineage that traces all the way back
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.080]   to Shaolin Temple.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.440]   And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.320]   and to bring Hung Gar to the world.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.440]   It's like he wanted to show the world this lineage.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.520]   In fact, you just said "Master of the Flying Guillotine"
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.800]   is Quentin's favorite movie,
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.080]   and we mentioned in "36 Chambers," it's my favorite movie,
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.800]   but the action director of "Master of the Flying Guillotine"
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.720]   is the director of "36 Chambers of Shaolin."
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.040]   And some of the things that's happening
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.760]   in "Master of the Flying Guillotine"
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.560]   is really the infant stage
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   of what this action director's gonna learn
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.440]   and then use later on in his movies.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.480]   So that's the beauty of it.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.240]   It's almost like, you know,
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.880]   Quentin is seeing him in his generation,
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.320]   so Quentin might have been the same age I was
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.160]   watching that movie.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.080]   And then when he becomes a director,
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.960]   I'm at Quentin's age and I'm seeing his work.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.600]   So some symbiontist relationship there.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.960]   And I'll end this question by saying,
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.160]   Hung Gar deals with the five animal technique.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.840]   The tiger, the crane, right?
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.520]   The leopard, the snake, and the dragon.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.360]   Those are the five, that's the five pattern.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.800]   Some people go seven, some go 12,
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.680]   but let's just stick to the five pattern first.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.360]   How do a man emulate a tiger?
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.000]   And you see a tiger's fists.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.560]   He curls before he spawns on you.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.520]   How does a man emulate a snake?
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.920]   It doesn't have to be only in the Kung Fu move.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.720]   It's in the ideology of the snake.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.440]   It's in the agility of the crane.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   At any moment, sometimes punching a person
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.040]   is not gonna work, as they would say
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.200]   in leopard fist or tiger paw.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.600]   So sometimes you might have to poke him
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.760]   in the eye with the crane's beak.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.280]   So having your mind able to adapt the instinct
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.680]   of the animal when you are being attacked
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.580]   or when you are being the aggressor,
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.560]   that's something that you don't need a form for.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.480]   That's the mentality.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.760]   So Kung Fu, like I said, it informs me endlessly
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.200]   because at first I was trying to learn all the,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.920]   ah, hold my, like I can't really hit you with that
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.840]   and really hurt you unless I've been banging my hand
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.720]   a thousand times on some bricks
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.400]   and made it so callous or muscles are so strong.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.680]   But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.840]   and I'm gonna tiger up on you and take that instinct
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.240]   and prance when I'm a prance,
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.760]   or fly away like the stork.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.560]   Like, yo, that's the mentality.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.760]   - It's much more than the technical moves.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.760]   It's much deeper.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.600]   - Yeah.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.440]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.840]   I mean, when I see the Kung Fu movies,
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.840]   'cause I love martial arts, all martial arts,
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.000]   and competitive ones too,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.080]   like the actual competitions and so on.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.360]   It just seems like Kung Fu movies go much deeper
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.080]   than just like the techniques.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.920]   - Yeah.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.200]   They strike, I mean, if you see it, right?
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.640]   Even, I watched a great MMA fight recently
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.640]   and just interesting 'cause he was on top of the guy,
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.280]   you know, and the way he got from under him,
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:40.200]   you know, it had to be, you know,
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.160]   his spirit got from under him.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   - It's something like mixture of crane and whatever.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.880]   - Snake, ill, with the slippery ill technique.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.240]   - Yeah, no, I love that when people become artists
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.520]   in the cage or that's much bigger than just like
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.800]   winning much bigger than particular techniques.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.640]   It's just art, especially at the highest level competition
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.760]   where millions of people are watching.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.040]   - Which is pressure within itself.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.320]   - Yes, that's art under pressure
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.160]   is even more beautiful art.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.760]   - You know, you look at some of these fights
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.720]   and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.280]   And sometimes the less talent guy could win
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.600]   because he could deal with the pressure.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.200]   When the other guy, he could have beat him
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.640]   if there was someone else, but not in this arena.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:31.840]   - So you're a scholar of history, including hip hop history.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.400]   I've listened to so many of your interviews.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.480]   You've spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.200]   in hip hop history, Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   Maybe let's look at Tupac and Biggie.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.840]   What made them special in the history of music?
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.880]   - That's a good question.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.200]   So I don't know if I'm the authority to answer it,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.840]   but I'll just speak my piece on it.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.720]   And maybe I can just add on,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.040]   'cause I'm sure it's a lot of people
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.320]   that spent a lot of time with them that could speak on it.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.200]   But just as a fellow artist,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:14.520]   I think not only was B.I.G. a dope lyricist,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.880]   I think he had a voice that was really immaculate
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.760]   in a sense that some rappers get on top of music
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.520]   and you gotta get used to them,
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.680]   or you gotta vibe with them.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   But he make a record sounds like a record immediately.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.040]   If you go back and listen to his music,
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.400]   you could take his voice and put it on anything.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.560]   And for some reason, it sounds like a record.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.360]   - Is he just like the raw voice of the man?
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.200]   - Yeah.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.760]   - So you could just listen to it raw
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.200]   and it sounds like a record.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.360]   - Yeah, but if you put a beat,
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.240]   take his voice and put it on any beat,
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.200]   he just has a voice, it's immaculate.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.480]   So his lyrical skills and all that was great.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.120]   And you gotta think once again,
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   he's doing all this, he's not even 25 years old.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.760]   Then you go to Pac, once again, immaculate voice.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.440]   But what Pac had, I think,
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.440]   was a way of touching us on all of our emotions.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.880]   And especially on, Pac had the power
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.720]   to infuse your emotional thought,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.120]   like Brenda has a baby, they're a mama.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.540]   But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.280]   You know? - Yeah.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.080]   - And those two things,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.960]   actually, he was probably more dangerous
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.440]   than Big, Notorious B.I.G.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.320]   Like Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.360]   to this day, we're still,
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.200]   but Pac was probably going to a point,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.000]   you know, he was more going into the Malcolm X of things.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.840]   - Yeah.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.200]   - And society fears that.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.400]   - Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.960]   and at starting revolutions.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.040]   - And that's dangerous.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.480]   - Very dangerous.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.720]   And Big communicated love,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.680]   but he wasn't starting revolutions.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.920]   (laughing)
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   - Well, it's interesting to think about
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.680]   what the world would be like if they were still with us.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.320]   But it's the way of the world.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.640]   Hendrix, a lot of those guys just go too soon.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.480]   - Yeah, it's a peculiar thing.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.200]   Now, you asked me earlier, am I scared of death?
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.760]   And I answered you, no, I'm not scared of death.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.360]   I mean, I'm not trying to see it, though.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.280]   - Yeah.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   - It's like, that was the block of death.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.720]   It's like, I'm not really going right there right now.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.020]   I'm making a left or right turn.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.360]   Unless it was mandatory for some greaterness,
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.600]   greater good, it's like, okay, I gotta drive through that.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.880]   - Yeah, but it can still happen.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.760]   That's the meditation on death part,
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.320]   where you could die at the end of today.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.520]   - Yeah, you could die, well, dying and death,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.820]   I think it's two different things, personally.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.240]   - The process you mean of death, or just--
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.120]   - Yeah, I mean, you could die, like I said,
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.600]   you could die every day.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.840]   You could die and not be yourself.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.760]   Which is crazy.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.160]   But to get to a point of no return,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.280]   that's a whole 'nother chamber.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.180]   - I mean, there's some sense in which,
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:46.120]   RZA, the producer, becomes somebody else completely
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.200]   when you're making a film,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.520]   becomes somebody else completely when you're,
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.760]   I don't know, playing chess,
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.800]   becomes completely something different
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.200]   when you do Kung Fu or watch Kung Fu,
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.720]   or when you're a family man.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.960]   All of those are little deaths
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.320]   when you transition from one place to another.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.520]   So it's not like you're one being, you're many things.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.400]   - Yeah.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.800]   I would describe, now I would describe that
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.000]   as a whole life, though.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.720]   (laughing)
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.560]   - Yeah, it's fun.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.200]   Outside of you and anybody on Wu-Tang,
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.960]   who is the greatest rapper from a lyrics,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.680]   like a wordsmith perspective in hip hop history,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.000]   or some of the greatest, maybe some candidates?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.600]   - Let's name a few.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.440]   I mean, you're gonna have to start with Rakim.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.280]   You know?
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.640]   You're gonna have to put Coogie Rap in there.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.640]   - So going back.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.880]   - You're gonna have to pick up with those brothers first.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.120]   You might have to, if you want a good,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.840]   technically you might have to start with Grandmaster Cass.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.480]   Who you might not, you might not even heard of.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.320]   - Nope.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.140]   - You know what I mean?
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.400]   But you may have sung his lyrics
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.080]   every time you sang Sugarhill, "Rapper's Delight."
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.920]   'Cause that's--
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.740]   - That's his?
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.720]   - Yeah, they copied his, and they made it theirs.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.120]   (laughing)
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.640]   But point being made, but I'll name a couple more.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.600]   I gotta put Nas in that category.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.440]   You know, we got a chessboard in front of us,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.400]   and one of the greatest chess players,
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.200]   the youngest Grandmaster, you know,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.520]   before, I think, Carlson,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   was Bobby Fischer.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   So let's use Bobby Fischer as American.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.160]   One of the greatest American chess players.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.720]   Of course, Susan Pogar may have tied his record
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.880]   as the youngest Grandmaster,
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   and she's the youngest female Grandmaster, I think, to date.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.480]   But he was a master at what, 14?
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.600]   - Yeah, something like that.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.480]   - Right?
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.800]   So now, to me, I met Nas when he was 15.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.760]   He was already a master lyricist.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.240]   It takes about 10 years to become a master lyricist.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.760]   So by the time the world heard Wu-Tang,
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.940]   most of us had 10 years of rapping in us already.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.880]   So that's why you met us at mastery level.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.280]   The Jizzle was already a master when Nas was a master,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.880]   but Jizzle was 21, Nas was 15.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.840]   (laughing)
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.400]   - Nas is like the Mozart of rap.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.760]   - Yeah, or the Bobby Fischer.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.640]   - Just a Bobby Fischer, just born something in him,
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.240]   or maybe those early years,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.000]   just because he's not just good at the lyrics,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.320]   he's also, he goes deep with it, just like you.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   So he's like, there's depth.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.320]   It's not just like mastery of the word smithing.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.640]   It's just the message you actually sent across.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   - It's information into a small phrase.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.120]   Right, that's the whole thing of energy.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.720]   How do we condense all that energy into this
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.960]   so that it can feel that?
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.420]   And he's definitely one of those artists,
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.240]   MCs that does that.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.480]   And he was doing it at 15.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.160]   Like I said, I'm thinking five years,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.380]   or four or five years older than Nas.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.280]   So I was always feeling my confidence
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.120]   over what I was doing,
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.360]   but I was like, this kid is only 15.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.160]   - I gotta step up my game.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.000]   - When he turned 19, then we got Illmatic.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:13.840]   - Yeah.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.600]   From you, what are the best
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.900]   and most memorable lyrics you've ever written?
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.180]   - Wow, that's a hard question for me.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.600]   - The stuff stand out, like stuff you're really proud of
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.680]   that was important in your career?
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   - Yeah, I mean, I think I did a song called "Sunshower."
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.720]   I don't know if it, we put it on the Wu-Tang Forever
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.900]   double CD, but only on the international version.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.560]   But if anybody could go get those lyrics
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.040]   and write those lyrics down,
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.420]   you could just put that in your pocket,
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.040]   and I'm sure it'll answer at least about 25%
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.340]   of your life's problems.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.320]   - Well, that's a good one, "Sunshine,"
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.080]   where you talk about religion and God, that's good.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   - Tomorrow, I think it's on "A Diagram."
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.440]   - I'm not a record guy, I'm a song guy.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.680]   - Might've been "A Diagram."
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.480]   What, do you have a lyric from it?
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.840]   - Yeah, "The answer to all questions."
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.080]   You're talking about God.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.960]   - Yeah.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.120]   - "The spark of all suggestions, of righteousness,
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.280]   "the pathway to the road of perfection,
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.040]   "who gives you all and never asks more of you,
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.260]   "the faithful companion that fights every war with you.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.560]   "Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   "he's the all in all you searching for the Oracle."
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.020]   That's a good line, man.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.680]   This is such a good, this is so good.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.920]   "A mission impossible, it's purely philosophical,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.340]   "but you can call on your deathbed
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.840]   "when you're laying in the hospital."
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.480]   - You will call them on your deathbed.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.100]   I had a big, I have a scientist friend,
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.560]   well, my wife's best friend, Rebecca,
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.080]   she married a scientist, they're both scientists,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.120]   they're both were scientists, and she married Dr. Neal.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.760]   I ain't gonna say their last names.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.760]   But Neal and Rebecca, you know,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.760]   they're my wife's best friends, so they come over,
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.320]   and me and Neal, we go through the longest debates
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.720]   of science and religion, we just go.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.320]   We could go a great day with it.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.760]   And, you know, before he had a child,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.600]   he was more adamant and, you know,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.120]   there's, you know, don't believe in God,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.360]   you know what I mean?
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.000]   After a child, he still kept his thing,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.440]   but I just hit him with the question,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.120]   if you was about to die,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.200]   'cause now you got a child to think about, right?
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.080]   It's different when you thinking about yourself.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.920]   I said, "If you was about to die,
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.160]   "you don't think you gonna make that call?"
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.600]   He's like, "I'll make that call."
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.480]   And it kinda inspired my lyric,
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.960]   because it was like, yeah, who you gonna?
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.320]   And I just wanna say, as far as,
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.620]   so you mentioned lyric, that is one of my favorite lyrics,
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.660]   but that's part two to "Sunshower"
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.260]   was the prequel to "Sunshine."
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.740]   So if you ever get a chance to check out "Sunshower,"
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.140]   it starts off with, "Trouble follows a wicked mind.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.840]   "2020 vision of the prism of life,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.100]   "but still blind because you lack the inner.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.580]   "So every sinner could end up
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.660]   "in the everlasting winter of hellfire.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.600]   "But thorns and splinters prick your eye out.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.180]   "You cry out, your words fly out,
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.200]   "but you remain unheard.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.420]   "Suffering, internal and external,
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.520]   "along with the wicked fraternal of generals and colonels,
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.080]   "letting off thermonuclear heat
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.060]   "that burns you firmly and permanently
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.520]   "upon the journey through the journal of the book of life.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.920]   "For those who took a life without justice
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   "will become just ice.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.020]   "It's been taught your worst enemy
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.820]   "couldn't harm you as much as your own wicked thoughts.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.520]   "But people ought be nought unless in wrought,
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.980]   "so they find themselves persecuted
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.940]   "inside their own universal court."
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.820]   So that is a long one, it's like a three-pager.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.120]   - Wow, that is about life.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.480]   That's like character, integrity, how to be,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.440]   how to be in this world,
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.240]   and that ultimately connects to God.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.740]   Who is God to you?
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.980]   - I'm glad you just asked that question
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.880]   'cause I actually,
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.860]   I'm gonna have to make a distinguishable separation here.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.820]   (laughs)
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.660]   - All right.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.960]   - And it's funny because I heard recently,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:34.700]   I heard a rabbi was debating with this historian,
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.740]   Dr. Ben, I can't pronounce Dr. Ben's name,
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.580]   but they was debating,
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.260]   and in the debate,
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.740]   they started going back through the etymology,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.580]   they went way back beyond antiquity
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.660]   'cause they was debating,
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.820]   and so there was some things,
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.340]   they was going deep,
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.420]   and they really went far, far back
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.740]   to kind of the first word of God.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.800]   And it was, when they pronounced it
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.760]   on this particular debate, it was Allah.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.140]   And they said from that, they got Elohim.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.820]   I've already agreed in my heart, in my life,
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.100]   that the father of this universe,
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.460]   proper name is Allah.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:20.220]   And of course, in Allah, I get all.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.300]   (laughs)
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:28.260]   And I don't think that God is the same as that.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.960]   I think Allah gives birth to God.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.540]   In fact, if you take the word Allah,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.500]   A-L-L-A-H,
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.180]   and you take it through numerology or numbers,
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.020]   the number A being,
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.300]   letter A being one, L being 12,
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.100]   and you add it all up to its lowest,
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.780]   to the last denominator,
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.860]   you're gonna get the number seven.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.220]   And the number seven's gonna bring you
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.500]   right back to that letter G.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.180]   So Allah borns God, but God don't born Allah.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.020]   - How does that God, how does Allah connect to the oracle
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.600]   that you're going to be calling for
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.380]   when you're laying in the hospital?
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.140]   - Well, what I was saying in that particular verse
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.260]   was that we're looking for the oracle.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.620]   We're looking for somebody else or something to help us
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.720]   that nobody can really help you at the end of the day.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.820]   And we're speaking on,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.540]   so now that we, I don't wanna say we're speaking on religion,
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.440]   but we're speaking on a way of life and a way of thinking.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.460]   And I've read many books, of course,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.300]   and I could say there's no book that,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.560]   the book that is the most strongest book I've ever read
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.400]   is actually the Holy Quran.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.720]   It's stronger to me than the Bible, which I've read.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.800]   It's stronger than quantum physics, which I've read.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.600]   It's stronger than the Bhagavad Gita.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.080]   It's just, and I read once a British scholar said
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.120]   it's the most stupidest book ever written,
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.880]   and it doesn't make sense.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.760]   And so I said, oh, I see why he says that.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.600]   Now I can understand exactly why he said that as well.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.920]   - Why is that?
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   - Because the structure of the words are just,
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.280]   it's peculiar, you know what I mean?
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.480]   But it's almost like how some people's songs,
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.880]   you don't really know exactly what they're saying
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.020]   until years later.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.800]   - Yeah, you have, actually with Joe Rogan,
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.080]   I think you talked about how a joke of Dave Chappelle's
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.720]   hit you like a long time after this,
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.420]   so this is kind of like the Quran.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.600]   I tend to believe that we,
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.520]   that human beings cannot possibly understand
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.840]   anything as big as these ideas.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.800]   So just, I don't know, do you think that,
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.520]   like are you humble in the face of just the immensity of it?
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.620]   - To be honest, yes.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.680]   I'm humble in the face of the,
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.840]   you can say the word again, I pronounce words funny,
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   the omnipotence, the omnescence, the magnitude,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.520]   I'm humble in the face of Allah.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.120]   The problem that I may have had was that
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.040]   I wasn't humble in the face of God
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:16.080]   because it's just a definable thing.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.040]   And that's why I think a lot of us,
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.200]   and I'm not saying that, you know,
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   I know when we say God, we're trying to say Allah,
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.800]   like people was saying that,
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.880]   but you're actually not saying the same thing
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.100]   because you're actually putting something beside Him.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.640]   And that's the reason why you can have,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.220]   oh, there's many gods.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.520]   You can find a whole bunch of them.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.360]   (laughs)
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.320]   But you're not gonna find many.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.480]   There's nobody beside Allah.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.800]   I mean, Allah is one.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.060]   So I know it's a whole thing, but that's my heart is there.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.960]   I'm humbled by it.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.120]   I'm at peace with it.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.220]   And it doesn't take nothing or demerit anything from myself.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.380]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.340]   It doesn't take nothing from me, from being who I am.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.780]   So if I say, if somebody walk up, "Yo, peace, God,"
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.860]   I could take that because they're telling me that,
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.220]   "Yo, I'm a man of wisdom.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.680]   "I'm a man of strength.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.140]   "I'm a man of beauty," or some attribute of that.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:15.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.860]   So Wu-Tang, they the gods of rap.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.340]   There's wisdom there, there's strength there,
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.240]   there's beauty, then we'll take that.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.740]   - So Wu-Tang is one of the greatest musical,
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.140]   artistic, philosophical groups ever.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.540]   Let's look hundreds of years from now,
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.300]   when humans or robots or aliens
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.760]   or whatever that's left here, they look back,
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.620]   what do you hope they remember about Wu-Tang?
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.280]   What do you hope the legacy is?
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.100]   - Well, even if it's thousands of years,
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.820]   I hope we don't get rid of the humans.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.960]   But you know, look, whatever happens is gonna happen.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.260]   But I think that my philosophy on it is that
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:58.100]   we're gonna continue to advance
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.020]   and continue to advance things around us.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.620]   But I don't see us becoming extinct.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.220]   - Well, I mean, the reason I bring up sort of Wu-Tang
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.260]   in that context, and this is a special moment
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.140]   in human history.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.860]   It's like 100 years and we've created all of this music.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.220]   Just if you think of all the richness of music
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.320]   that's been created over 100 years,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.780]   it's like, it's not obvious to me
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.420]   that that's not going to stop.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.780]   Like there's a flourishing here.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.020]   So it's funny 'cause I could see where the book
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.540]   of human history is written.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.160]   There's a chapter on this period of time.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.020]   And one of the things we did well
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.860]   is like all the technological innovation
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.780]   with like with rockets and with the internet,
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.580]   but then there's also the musical innovation
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.060]   and film innovation.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.780]   Just so much art that's being created
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.980]   and Wu-Tang is a huge part of that.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.200]   So I just wonder what, like if there's a few sentences
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.400]   written about Wu-Tang.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.340]   (laughing)
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.780]   It just makes me wonder how they remember.
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.080]   - I would hope that people will,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.540]   no matter how many years are inspired by us,
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:07.300]   but I will say if I can just use Wu-Tang as itself.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.780]   So we first started off the witty,
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.780]   unpredictable talent and natural game, right?
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.700]   Natural game, meaning natural wordplay.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.700]   And then we went to the wisdom of the universe,
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:32.160]   the truth of Allah for a nation of God.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:37.920]   Wisdom, universal, truth, Allah, nation, God.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.420]   It's just like, so this is go back to a nation of God.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.260]   Let's just take the last two letters.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.780]   A nation of wisdom, strength and beauty, right?
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.180]   And I'm gonna go a little political here,
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.660]   but not going political.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.060]   As we're saying we're the greatest country in the world,
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.700]   what makes us the greatest?
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.740]   That should be a question we ask.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.740]   Is it our wisdom?
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.580]   Is it our strength?
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.820]   Is it our beauty?
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.460]   Now, let's just say off the easiest answer,
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.520]   you know it's our strength, we got the nukes.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.780]   Nobody can really, between America and Russia,
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.020]   they said, that's the argument.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.020]   Who could beat them?
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.980]   But where's the wisdom?
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:24.660]   Then they can argue, well, we got the technology, right?
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.900]   But then where's the beauty
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.160]   when there's so much suffering in the people?
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.500]   So it's not complete.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.300]   - The hope is that the wisdom is in the founding documents
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.500]   in the imperfect, but wise founding documents
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.680]   that celebrated freedom, that celebrated all the ideas,
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.740]   sort of having a lot of nukes,
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.220]   having a lot of airplanes and tanks.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.180]   And that's not important.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.780]   And the hope is whatever we're doing here
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.260]   with this quote greatest country on earth,
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.980]   that we preserve the ideas and help them flourish.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.820]   - Yeah, well, that's what I mean.
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.980]   So if you go back to the Wu Tang, I'm saying,
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.580]   that's what we're striving for.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.380]   We're striving for that, you know what I mean?
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.580]   - We started on predictable and just like.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.420]   - Yeah.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.380]   - Yeah, but like got deep pretty quick.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:18.140]   - Yeah, I gotta talk to you about Bruce Lee.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.740]   Who's Bruce Lee to you?
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.940]   Who is he to the world?
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.300]   What ideas of his were interesting to you?
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.660]   Like what, you know, you talk about like Hendrix and music,
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.260]   Bruce Lee is that a martial arts.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.140]   He just seems to have changed the game.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.740]   - Yeah, you know, I went as,
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.180]   I guess I don't know what the word bold
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.060]   is the right word to say,
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.060]   but I went as bold as to say that he was a minor prophet.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.100]   And I got that concept from the Holy Quran
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.620]   where it says that we send prophets to every nation,
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.180]   every village.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.340]   We don't let nobody not hear the word in some form.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.020]   'Cause it won't be fair.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.020]   And so if Allah is merciful,
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.420]   even a man who's deaf has to somehow get a sign.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.820]   I don't know if Moses saw a burning bush.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.900]   It was nobody else to talk to.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.220]   So he had to talk to the bush.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.140]   I don't know.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.540]   It could have been the bush this way too, right?
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.460]   But point being made,
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.020]   it says that there are minor prophets
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.580]   and I see Bruce Lee as one of them
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.900]   because what he brought to the world through martial art
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:27.100]   was a whole shift in the dynamic of thinking, you know?
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.660]   And that happens when certain entities are born,
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:35.660]   but he didn't do it only in a physical sense.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.100]   He was also for the philosophizing in the same process.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.980]   And he was also striving to be the best of himself.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.780]   So you got three things going on.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.140]   I studied Bruce Lee multiple times.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.340]   And first, of course,
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.900]   when I saw my first Kung Fu movie,
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.380]   it was the fake, it wasn't really Bruce Lee.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.580]   It was a few green hornet clips cut together.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.020]   And then I saw "Black Samurai."
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.180]   Then my following Kung Fu movies
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.780]   was like "Fearless Fighters," "The Ghostly Face,"
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.380]   you know, "The Fist of the Devil."
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.780]   But basically, in "Fearless Fighters,"
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.480]   the lady put the little kid on her back
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.820]   and flew across the ocean, across the lake, right?
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.940]   So Bruce wasn't doing that.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.220]   And then I went on to "Five Deadly Venoms"
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.740]   and "Spiermen" and "36 Chambers."
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:36.260]   And these movies are beautiful
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.140]   and yet they're all heightened.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.940]   Bruce, they're heightened beyond doable.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.780]   You're not gonna--
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.620]   - Yeah, it's like surreal.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.460]   They play with the world that's not of this world.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.860]   - Yeah.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.180]   Bruce played with this world.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:55.060]   So when I first saw Bruce,
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.780]   I actually didn't think he was as good as these guys.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.900]   He can't fly.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.300]   He's not flying in the movies, right?
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:06.140]   But then when I saw,
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.820]   'cause the first one I saw was "The Big Boss,"
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.220]   which they retitled "Fist of Fury."
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.820]   But then when I saw "Chinese Connection,"
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.900]   which is the real "Fist of Fury,"
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:21.300]   right, I saw something different there.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   And I got enamored.
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.380]   And then of course, "Enter the Dragon," right?
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.020]   Just really complete.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.020]   That's why my first album was "Enter the Wu Tang,"
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.420]   "36 Chambers of Shaolin."
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.500]   So it's "Enter the Dragon" and "36" put together
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.180]   'cause those are the two epitomes.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.260]   So what happened is, that's young me.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.300]   Then teenage me studies him again.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.700]   And I realized, wow, look at his physicality.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.900]   Look how he's really, he's moving for real.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.300]   And then I studied him again.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.800]   Wow, look at what he's saying.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.900]   Then I studied him again.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.660]   Wow, look at what he stands for.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:03.460]   - Which do you like in the realm of martial arts,
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.780]   the real or the surreal, or the dance between the two?
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.220]   - Yeah, I like the dance between the two
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:14.100]   because a movie to me is to entertain you.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:20.580]   So I'm cool with Obi-Wan Kenobi disappearing out of the cloak
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.860]   when Vader strikes him down.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.500]   And then I'm like, "Yo, what happened?"
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.260]   And he's like, "Run, Luke, run."
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.220]   [laughing]
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.780]   I'm cool with that, right?
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.060]   Because that's the imagination.
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.460]   And the imagination gets stimulated to the point
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.140]   to where as things that we saw imagined by our artists,
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.220]   we strive to create in our real world.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.300]   Thus, "Star Trek" to me is just a precursor
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.500]   to our cell phones.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.680]   - Yeah.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.140]   - So for me, I like the mix, the two.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.780]   - Yeah, it's funny how science fiction,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.180]   pushing into the impossible actually makes it realized
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.020]   eventually.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:57.860]   - Yeah.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.420]   - Yeah, we humans, once we see an idea on screen,
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.140]   no matter how wild it is, we--
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:02.980]   - We're trying to make it.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.900]   - Yeah, we're trying to make it.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.620]   There's some young kid that gets inspired and watch that.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.180]   Be like, "I'm gonna build that."
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.020]   - Exactly.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.700]   So I don't know who's gonna come
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.980]   with the "Back to the Future" time machine,
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.500]   but do you have any classmates that you think--
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.340]   [laughing]
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.780]   - Time machine?
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.700]   I thought you were going to "Back to the Future,"
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.220]   like the, what is it?
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.420]   The hoverboard or like--
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.860]   - Yeah, we're there at least.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.700]   - Yeah.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.540]   - Somebody, they got, you seen the one on the water?
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.380]   - No.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.200]   - No, you know--
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.040]   - It's close on the water, wait.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.180]   - No, the surf hover.
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.420]   - It's great, it's dope.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.260]   - Nice.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.100]   - It's dope.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.180]   It actually, if you a "Back to the Future" fan,
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.060]   you feel like you made it to, you made it there.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:43.900]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.180]   Well, now we just gotta work on the time travel.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.340]   And it was cool to hear you talk about
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.660]   the master of the flying guillotine today,
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:55.660]   that that inspired the lyric for the Wu-Tang Clan
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.820]   and nothing to F with.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.020]   - Yeah.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.260]   - How does that go again?
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.700]   - What, the curse word or the lyric?
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.540]   - No, not that.
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.380]   (laughing)
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.300]   - No, I remember the curse.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.460]   I am Russian, but I remember the curse word.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.900]   But the lyric.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.500]   - I said, "I be tossing and forcing.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.820]   "My style is awesome.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.260]   "I'm causing more family feuds than Richard Dawson.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.060]   "And the survey said, you're dead.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.500]   "The fatal flying guillotine chops off your head."
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.340]   - Yeah.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.160]   - Yeah.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.900]   - And it was interesting to see the guillotine
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:31.900]   in that movie today, how, I don't know.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.740]   That's surreal, right?
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.580]   But it's not.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.300]   It's engineering, it's both surreal and it just,
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.300]   and it adds this chaos into this real world
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.300]   that, and then challenges everybody to think
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.500]   what you're gonna do with that.
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.700]   - Yeah, how you gonna beat it?
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.700]   - Yeah, how you gonna beat it?
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.420]   Both when you have like the good and the evil
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.220]   and the mix of the bad guys and the good guys,
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.100]   and you're not sure who the bad guys are.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.540]   It's the old question of good versus evil, right?
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.380]   - Yeah.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.180]   - Like you said, then the question of who was good,
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.540]   who was evil, but they all had a similar problem
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.620]   when the guillotine came.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.020]   - But in terms of the real, you mentioned "The Godfather,"
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.660]   good and evil, that's your favorite movie.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.720]   - Yeah.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.140]   - What makes it great, do you think?
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.420]   The characters, the study of family, of justice, of power.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.300]   What connects with you?
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.340]   - Oh, oh, I mean, every one of those themes
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.040]   connects in the real,
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.860]   and it connects in a cinematic way as well.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.420]   The difference I think with me in "The Godfather"
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.380]   was I seen it during a period of time
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.800]   when my father was absent,
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:43.860]   and therefore family structure and family values
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:49.240]   was actually adopted in my family because of that.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.580]   Me and my brother, Devon, we actually took
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:59.140]   so much heed to that movie in our family life.
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:04.140]   And we kind of mimic that family in its structure
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:10.340]   of somebody has to be the leader of the family,
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.340]   even if it was the younger.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:15.060]   Michael was younger than Sonny and Phaedra,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:15.900]   you know what I mean?
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.460]   But he was worthy.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.220]   And my brother, Devon, is older than me,
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.820]   and my brother, King, is older than me.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.420]   And it's funny, sometimes Devon calls King, Phaedra,
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.780]   and I know King wants to, 'cause King was actually,
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.100]   he actually was, he could beat our ass,
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.940]   to say it in my language.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.460]   But you're Michael.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.960]   Yeah, and not by choice,
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.740]   just by definition of that's what I am,
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:39.580]   you know what I mean?
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:43.380]   And it's just a blessing for me
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.180]   to have my older sister, my older brothers,
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:50.780]   and my younger brothers look to me as,
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.580]   just as a good light in the family.
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.660]   And like I said, that movie helped my sisters too.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.100]   The cool thing about my family,
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.020]   I don't know if I share this a lot,
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.780]   is a big, we all watch these movies together.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.460]   And so, "The Eight Diagram," "Pole Fighter,"
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.940]   "Master Killer," "Five Deadly Vengeance,"
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.380]   my family knows these movies.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:15.780]   It's not just I know them, right?
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.260]   And then you extend it further,
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.900]   my friends know them, right, too.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.260]   So there's a language that we all can have
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:29.080]   that actually film has informed our communication.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:33.060]   So "The Godfather," which also is still
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.740]   a fictitional story of something,
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.900]   but since it was based in reality,
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.700]   based on something real, and it was human,
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.620]   it wasn't so heightened,
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.180]   I think the purity of it resonates.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.520]   And the purity of it is something that resonates with me.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.220]   You gotta plan ahead.
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:59.000]   He didn't wanna deal with the drugs,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.220]   but that time of business was upon him.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.460]   It's almost like, and this is a tough one,
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.020]   sometime when the Muslim brothers come
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.340]   from the Middle East to America,
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.140]   and they open up delis, right,
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.460]   they would sell ham.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.260]   And we would go in there and complain to them,
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.820]   and make them, they used to get mad at us
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.020]   when we came in.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:22.980]   But that's as a kid, but as a man,
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.660]   I'm like, yo, he's here to sell.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.420]   Now he still don't have to sell the ham.
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.940]   Like Vito Corleone didn't wanna sell the drugs.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.660]   Okay, he didn't have to do it, he didn't do it.
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:36.400]   And it cost him some bullets.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.020]   So eventually somebody in the family ended up doing it.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.780]   You see what I mean?
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.860]   - What about this idea that family before everything else?
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.300]   So like, there's different laws you live
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:54.180]   according to in this world, and family is first.
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:58.220]   - Yeah, that's mathematically correct.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.420]   - I like that.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.820]   I mean, there's a certain sense of,
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.420]   you look at powerful people, you look at Putin,
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.820]   there's a certain sense in which the people
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.780]   who are in the inner circle, that's who you take care of.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.020]   That's family.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.760]   And anyone else that crosses you,
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.300]   that there's a different set of ethics
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.860]   under which you operate for those people.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.240]   - Well, Jesus said the same thing.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.460]   You know, when he said love thy neighbor and thy brother,
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.780]   he was talking about that community.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.900]   When that other lady, the Samaritan,
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.740]   say, hey Jesus, I'm not feeling,
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.180]   my brother not feeling so well,
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:42.460]   and he say, give not that which is holy unto the dogs.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:43.900]   If you're gonna tell a woman,
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:48.740]   give not that which is holy unto the dogs,
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.780]   and she's a woman, you just called her a dog.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.460]   If I translate that into hip hop,
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.220]   she's a female, he called her a dog.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.860]   - I know how that goes.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.960]   - But she said to him,
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.340]   but even a dog is allowed to eat the crumbs
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.440]   that falls from the master's table.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.460]   And he went and helped her.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.300]   He helped her.
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.540]   And let's go back to what you said about Putin
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.460]   or Vito Colonna, myself and my family.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.820]   Of course the family is first,
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.380]   but once the family is good,
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:22.980]   it has to then spread to the community,
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:27.860]   then to the state, country, world.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.060]   The problem we have sometimes is that,
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.820]   and this is the reason why a lot of powerful families
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:35.220]   was overthrown, like why do they behead their own king
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.500]   with the guillotine, right?
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.720]   Because that, once the family was strong,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.400]   they didn't let the wealth, the opportunity expand out.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:53.440]   You look at Wu Tang, yes, our family was made strong first,
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.680]   but then all the Wu members
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.920]   able to form their own corporations,
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.400]   and they had their own sub-families.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.440]   It has to grow out.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.200]   - And they took over the world.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.920]   You've talked about being vegan.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.720]   I don't think I heard you explain this
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.420]   because it connects somehow about how you think about life.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.960]   So you talk about when your family's good,
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.340]   you grow that like circle of empathy, you grow the community.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:24.760]   Is that how you think about being vegan?
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   That just the capacity of living beings on earth to suffer,
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.440]   that you just don't wanna add suffering to them?
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   - Yeah, I mean, you said it clear.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.820]   It's like nothing, in all reality,
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:44.160]   I came to a realization that nothing really has to die
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.320]   for me to live.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:49.520]   No animal, the plants themselves, right?
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.480]   So let's just say you want a steak,
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.840]   which is probably the most,
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.320]   I don't know, the most expensive piece of meat,
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.460]   but let's just say the steak is top of the line, nice steak.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.280]   And you're eating the steak for the protein
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.320]   to help build your muscle.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.680]   And I don't know if you got it from a cow or a bull,
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.520]   but whether it's the cow or the bull,
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.000]   they grow to about 1500 pounds.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.520]   And if it's a bull, it's all muscly muscle.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:18.080]   And it's only eating grass.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:24.240]   - Yeah, yeah, there's, yeah.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.800]   It's possible to both as an athlete
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.880]   and just as a human being to perform well
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:29.920]   without eating meat.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.200]   There's something,
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.840]   especially in the way we're treating animals,
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.680]   to deliver that meat to the plate.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   I think about that a lot.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.180]   So I do, I'm a robotics person, AI person.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.160]   And I think a lot about,
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.720]   I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff,
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.380]   but building AI systems
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.960]   as they become more and more human-like,
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.720]   you start to ask the question of, are we okay
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:59.080]   if we give the capacity for AI systems to suffer,
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.480]   first to feel, but then to suffer,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.800]   to hate and to love, to feel emotion?
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.600]   How do we deal with that?
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.040]   It starts asking the same question as you ask of animals.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.600]   Are we okay adding that suffering to the world?
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.760]   - Right.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.560]   And I don't think we should add the suffering
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.440]   'cause it's not necessary.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.440]   Like, look, if it's necessary, right?
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.480]   'Cause we're, you know, survival,
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.200]   the first law of nature is self-preservation.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.120]   If you are in a desert and there's nothing else to eat,
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.680]   but that lizard, yeah, okay, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   - Lizard's gotta go.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.520]   - Yeah, you gotta go.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.400]   You gotta do what you gotta do
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.880]   because at the end of the day, man is,
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.840]   when they say man has dominion over these things,
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.560]   his dominion is almost like a caretaker.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.120]   The way we do our dominion, we dominate it,
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.800]   eat it, cook it.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.920]   Like, who's the first guy that looked at the lobster?
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.720]   He was like, "I'm gonna eat this thing."
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.040]   Like, first of all, it's hard to eat it.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.520]   You gotta go through a process to get that.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.480]   A crab, I remember we used to eat crabs when we was kids
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.760]   and I didn't know why I was always getting itchy throats
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.600]   and all that.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.040]   You know, you can't, you don't know, just eat.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.840]   But at the end of the day, a crab didn't provide
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:15.720]   no more than a finger worth of meat, maybe.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.800]   And it was hell getting that steak, getting it out.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.920]   It's like, it's not worth it in all reality.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.560]   You could've gave me a,
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.000]   you could've gave me a banana
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.520]   and did better for my body
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:33.880]   and my appetite and my being fulfilled as full.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.920]   Like, look at the blessings of life, right?
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.360]   If you take a seed,
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.480]   or you get an apple and you eat it,
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.240]   in that apple is multiple seeds in it.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.040]   If you plant that seed, it'll give you a whole tree
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:56.760]   with a whole bunch of apples with all multiple seeds.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   But if you kill a fish, it can't reproduce, it's done.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.480]   If you kill a cat, it's done.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.840]   It's nothing coming back.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.000]   But when you deal with the plants,
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.560]   even after you eat the apple and then you defecate,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.400]   your defecation is what feeds the ground
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.200]   that caused the apple to grow more.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.960]   Yeah, it's a circle of life.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:21.280]   - And especially there's a guy named David Foster Wallace.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.560]   He wrote a short story called "Consider the Lobster."
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.800]   If you actually think philosophically about what,
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.700]   from a perspective of a lobster,
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:32.280]   that's like symbolic of something
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.920]   because you basically put in the water, like cold water,
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.160]   and then it heats up slowly until it's no more.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.000]   - It's torture, yeah.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:42.840]   It must've been like,
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   you think they started eating lobsters in the Inquisition?
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.960]   They just enjoy,
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.080]   they were probably enjoyed torturing animals
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.640]   and they realized they're also delicious
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.920]   after the torture is finished.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   That's probably how they discovered it.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.880]   - Let me ask you a question.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.000]   I know you're asking me the questions,
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.960]   but I just wanna talk a little bit about the AI.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.720]   And you said something about trying to put the emotion in it.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.820]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:10.940]   So are you thinking there's an algorithm for emotion?
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:15.720]   - Yes, but I think emotion isn't something
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.500]   that there's a algorithm for, for a particular system.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.440]   We create emotions together.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.440]   So emotion is something, like this conversation,
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.600]   it's like magic we create together.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.920]   So I've worked with quite a few robots,
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.040]   I've a very simple version of that.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.160]   I've had Roomba vacuum cleaners.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.720]   I've had them make different sounds
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.200]   and one of them is like screaming in pain, like lightly.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.160]   And just having them do that when you kick them
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.560]   or when they run into stuff,
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.800]   immediately I start to feel something for them.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.160]   - So the emotion, okay.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.960]   So the emotion you're saying is imposed back on the human.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.320]   - Yeah. - But I'm asking,
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.040]   do you think there's an algorithm for the emotion
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.000]   to be imposed from machine to machine?
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.700]   - Yeah, that's a really good way to ask it.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.960]   It's difficult because I think ultimately
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.280]   I only know how to exist in the human world.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.120]   So it's like, it's the question of if a tree falls
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.960]   in the forest, nobody's there to see it,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.400]   does it still fall?
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   I still think that ultimately machines will have to
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.640]   show emotion to other humans
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.240]   and that's when it becomes real.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.440]   - I've been thinking about this a lot too.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.520]   And I just, okay.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.160]   Now I come at you with this
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.000]   because I've been thinking about this
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.240]   and this is your field.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.720]   Well, do you think the emotion is wave?
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.760]   Like light is wave or do you think it's particle?
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.600]   - So emotion is just a small,
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.320]   it's like a shadow of something bigger.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.960]   And I think that bigger thing is consciousness.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.440]   So emotion is just--
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.240]   - I don't know if it's a wave or a particle.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.220]   Y'all haven't thought about that?
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:02.140]   - I have thought about it, whether there's something like,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:06.600]   whether consciousness or emotion is a law of physics.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.760]   Like if it's that fundamental to the--
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.040]   - I had a lyric, I had a lyric that said this.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.760]   It comes out, they did this documentary about the planet
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.520]   and I wrote a song, it's called "The World of Confusion."
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.240]   And I'll try to paraphrase the lyric,
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.680]   but in the world of the confusion
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.940]   where there's so much illusions,
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.440]   we suck the blood from the planet.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.440]   Now it needs a transfusion and the redistribution of wealth,
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.280]   of health and wealth of self
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.440]   and a deeper understanding about mental health.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.580]   The doctor prescribed the physical solution.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:49.800]   The psychiatrist wants to build a bigger institution,
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.280]   but neither have the solution or the equation
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.840]   to make an instrument to measure
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.180]   the weight of the hate vibration.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.600]   What is the weight of hate?
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.560]   Is it heavier than the weight of love?
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:15.320]   Is it heavier than the weight of lead inside of a slug?
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.080]   Which is 10 milligrams, that's all it takes to kill a man.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.540]   But anyways, then I go on from there.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.800]   - Damn, that's good.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.940]   - But the question, you see the question there, right?
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.780]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.380]   Can it be measured?
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.540]   Can that be measured?
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.460]   I think so, I think so.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.980]   - Just don't got the estimate yet, right?
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.260]   - Yeah, we're in the dark ages of that,
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.380]   but I think it could be measured.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.100]   I think there's something physical,
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.940]   like something that connects us all this much.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.900]   You know, we tend to think we humans are distinct entities
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.100]   and we move about this world,
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.260]   but I think there's some deeper connection.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.340]   But we're so, listen, science is in the,
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.940]   we just had a few breakthroughs in the past 100 years
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:58.880]   from Einstein on the theoretical physics side.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.860]   We don't know anything about human psychology.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.780]   We barely know much about human biology.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.720]   We're trying to figure it all out.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.660]   - Yeah, I had another theory,
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.820]   because you think about quantum, right?
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.540]   As long as you say that there's an uncertainty
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.260]   and you have me believe there's an uncertainty,
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.180]   then there's an uncertainty.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.260]   But if there's not an uncertainty, what happens?
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.500]   So I'm only saying that, it's last, last, last.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.940]   'Cause you look at quantum computers,
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.620]   they're gonna give you the O, the one, the one, the O.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.460]   They're gonna take two things and make it eight things.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.340]   And by the time you multiply four of those things together,
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.180]   it's like this chess board, right?
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.080]   The moves goes into the millions.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.080]   But the thing that's introduced is the uncertainty, right?
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.580]   You're gonna make a move.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.940]   You know this already, right?
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.060]   Because this has been played a thousand times.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.620]   But sooner or later, something uncertain is gonna come in
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.440]   or make your next move.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:15.940]   - I like the weight of these.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.340]   They add the certainty.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.660]   I think just like we were saying, unpredictable.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.860]   There's something about us humans
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.740]   that really doesn't like everything to be fully predictable.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:30.680]   I mean, chess too is perfectly solvable.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.900]   There's nothing unpredictable about chess.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.460]   - Right, I could agree to that
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.460]   because Bobby Fischer said in one of his books,
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.460]   which I actually love what he said.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:46.680]   He said, "Every game of chess is a draw."
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.660]   - Yeah.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.740]   - The only way somebody win is when one of us
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.880]   makes a mistake.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.300]   - I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.220]   - Yeah, it doesn't.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.360]   What is chess?
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.580]   Like, how do you think about chess?
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.500]   What's at the core of your interest in chess?
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:07.500]   Do you see Kung Fu, music, film, all of it, life,
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.860]   all just living through chess?
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.500]   - Yeah, I see.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:16.500]   It's the most stimulating passage of time for me.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.740]   That's also, it's like, it's a pastime
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.280]   that stimulates my mind, my music,
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.580]   my thoughts about life at the same time.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.140]   So while some pastimes is like,
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.100]   say baseball is a pastime,
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.100]   and baseball can stimulate you
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.340]   depending on how you look at it, right?
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.440]   But most likely you're not gonna get
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.960]   this much brain activation, this much calculation,
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.820]   and this much thinking about yourself
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.420]   in a game of baseball.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.620]   I mean, the player maybe, but not the viewer.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.980]   Chess is something that I can engage in too.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.340]   And even though it's a pastime,
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:59.100]   it's giving me all the stimulation of real time in my life.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.100]   - It's funny 'cause it's also,
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.900]   it's a funny game 'cause it's connected
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.900]   through centuries of play.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.500]   Just some of the most interesting people
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.820]   in the history of the world have played this game
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.460]   and have struggled with whatever,
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.300]   have projected their struggles onto the chessboard
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.140]   and thought through,
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.900]   and then nations have fought over the chessboard.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.740]   - Right, right.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.500]   - The Soviet Union versus the United States.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.620]   Bobby Fischer represented the United States.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.340]   - Spassky represented the Soviet Union.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:27.860]   - Yeah.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.500]   I gotta, before I lose track of it,
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.420]   when we talked about "The Godfather,"
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.100]   you were in "American Gangster," great film.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.940]   You said it's one of your favorites too.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.960]   You were in it with Denzel Washington.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.860]   What makes that movie meaningful to you?
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.140]   What was it like making that movie?
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.300]   'Cause it's a great, great American film.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.620]   - That was a great American film.
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.340]   It was so many things in that film.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:54.780]   Being a part of that film was probably
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.300]   a blessing and a treasure.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.340]   'Cause even if I wasn't a part of it,
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.740]   this court's such great filmmaking
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.940]   and to me a really cool, great story.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:11.180]   The thing that I love about it the most
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.680]   really is the process of it.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.260]   - Which part of the process?
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.460]   - I wouldn't have known the process if I wasn't part of it.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.940]   So as a film, joy, it was great film.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.860]   But even the process of making it
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.460]   was like high level education for me on multiple levels.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.180]   I'm working with Ridley Scott,
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.540]   which is, and this is a bold statement if I say this here,
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.580]   'cause I got a lot of friends that's gonna probably,
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.220]   but he's probably the best living director.
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:51.260]   Because watching him allowed me to understand
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.100]   a principle that I've coined to him,
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.180]   and I don't know if people use it yet,
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.500]   called multi-vision.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:03.060]   He seems to have the capacity
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:09.020]   to see eight things at one time.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.780]   I heard on Robin Hood he had 18 cameras.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.300]   I wasn't there for that.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.620]   - And you think he keeps them all in his mind, just sees--
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:19.260]   - I seen him do it when he went to the monitors
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.380]   with the video playback guy.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.520]   I seen him bring everything back to a point,
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.520]   but nothing was the same on the frame.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.500]   He was already there.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.760]   And he knew if he had what it was or not.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.260]   And he placed the cameras there,
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:44.900]   and he saw it in his own way, and I peeped it.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.500]   (laughing)
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.700]   I peeped it.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.860]   And I said, "Yeah."
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.660]   And I just humbly asked him.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:55.020]   He was gracious enough to speak to me and talk to me
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:59.580]   and confirm what I thought I saw.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.420]   - He confirmed it?
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.300]   - He confirmed it, and I was able to utilize it,
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.340]   as I'm a filmmaker now,
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:09.100]   and I see, I can at least see three or four things.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.300]   I can't see eight yet.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.740]   I'll be there though.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.900]   But I could definitely, even right now,
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.960]   just I could go like this in the room.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.260]   Okay.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.420]   I got it now.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.380]   I got how to make this right here,
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.020]   which is just us all sitting.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.260]   How do I make this?
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.500]   Look, boom.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.140]   Come on on him.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:32.960]   - There's a story there.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.060]   - There's a story there.
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.380]   And I might just go off his hanging watch
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.100]   or his hanging wristband.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.940]   - Yeah.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.340]   - You know, because there's something else there too.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.180]   - Is he dead?
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:42.000]   We don't know.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.860]   - Okay.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.860]   - So he has this.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.420]   And even though this is the scene.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.260]   - Yeah.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.660]   You keeping that in mind, all of this in mind.
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.580]   - Yeah.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.860]   - What about like, can you give an inkling
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.660]   of other parts of the process, like the editing?
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.100]   Like where does the magic happen?
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.740]   - Another thing, Pedro,
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.140]   I don't pronounce Pedro last name right.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:02.980]   He's a cool guy.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.700]   I had a chance to play rugby with him.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.180]   He was on, was he on my team?
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.320]   Well, we were in both teams.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.460]   But Pedro, the editor who, you know,
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.540]   edit many great films.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.160]   Once again, he has,
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.940]   I will call it deciphering power.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.400]   A good editor is a decipher,
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.060]   almost like breaking the enigma
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:34.020]   because he's dealing with thousands,
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.460]   or we'll call it a film,
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.740]   with millions of feet of film,
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.860]   at least a million feet of film.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.580]   That's a lot of film for a feature.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.920]   He's dealing with that,
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.460]   but he's dealing with multiple cameras.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.060]   - Yeah.
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.700]   - So it ain't like it's like two cameras.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.820]   He got an A, B, and he could just go back.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.340]   No, he may have six cameras
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.140]   and he has to go back and deal with that process.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.060]   And you know what?
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:01.520]   He knows how to tell the story again.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.980]   And he proved it on "American Gangster"
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.020]   as me being a witness,
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.940]   because it's so much information.
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.220]   It's even when the brothers all start
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.260]   getting their little business
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.180]   and he picked one in the Bronx,
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.460]   and he just captured every neighborhood
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.880]   within one minute,
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.860]   and you knew what would happen.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:23.980]   You knew it all.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.500]   You saw the whole rise to fame.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.020]   You watch the Palmer and Scarface,
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.640]   who does it in two minutes,
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.140]   but it's only one character.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.460]   So you see him go to the bank,
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.500]   he drops the money off.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.740]   You see him buy the lion.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.860]   You see him gets his wife or the tiger.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.700]   You see him gets his wife.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:41.820]   You see all that.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.780]   Then it ends on a big shot of him in the big house
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.620]   with all the TV screens.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.100]   And you seen him go through it, right?
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.440]   But in "American Gangster,"
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.580]   you're gonna tell that story of rising,
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.860]   but you also got to include these five brothers.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.300]   - Yeah.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.780]   And that's all in the edit.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.620]   Oh man.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.100]   - But also all in the director,
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.260]   knowing that as well.
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.460]   - And you gotta keep track.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.900]   You gotta keep thinking about them,
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.500]   'cause that was a story right there.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.340]   - Yeah.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.540]   While I was hearing it,
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.180]   I don't know if they was taking pictures of him
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.900]   or everybody's having a little party over there.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.300]   Chess, I think.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.700]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.660]   They're playing chess in the distance.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.540]   This is great.
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:25.940]   You said that you were always an old soul
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.180]   and see the world as if you're 200 years old.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.420]   I like this line.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.220]   Because your creative vision allows you
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.740]   to see the final piece you've created
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.380]   or you're creating very quickly, quicker than others.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:42.180]   I heard that as if you've almost lived many lives.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.740]   So you have this experience
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.500]   that allows you to see the vision.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.620]   So let me ask you on creativity.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.700]   Where does this creativity behind "RZA" come from?
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:53.060]   This both musically and film-wise.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.300]   - That I don't know if I have the answer to that one.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:58.840]   No, seriously, where does it come from?
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.020]   Only thing I could say about that
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:06.140]   is that for some reason, it seems endless.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:12.660]   And that's peculiar when I think about it myself
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:18.620]   because I was taught a lot of things from the jizzer.
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.060]   He introduced me to mathematics.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:26.060]   He introduced me to hip hop itself, to breakdancing.
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.660]   I got other cousins that introduced me to graffiti.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:34.180]   Cousins that introduced me to DJing.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.940]   I realized that I had a lot of introductions,
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.340]   but the jizzer definitely,
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:44.380]   my older cousin gave me a lot of early inspirations.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:49.380]   And not saying that he's not creative,
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:53.420]   as creative as he was then or now,
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.820]   I just didn't, the wide span of creativity,
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.860]   I don't see him doing that.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:06.940]   And I don't see my, the cousins that taught me how to DJ,
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:11.180]   I didn't see them move from DJing to making the beats.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:18.260]   My cousin that, who actually got me into instruments,
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:23.620]   I didn't see him leave funk and rock.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.500]   He didn't go, like I'm orchestra composing now.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.340]   - Yeah.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.980]   - So I just said to myself,
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:36.940]   I just accept myself as a artist, as a creative artist.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:37.780]   That's what I am.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.380]   I have to accept that.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.060]   Now, where it comes from, I don't know.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.620]   If I was to try to say where it comes from,
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:48.500]   like, hey, give me some type of answer,
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.660]   I'll say from life itself.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.580]   - But what does it feel like?
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.900]   Because you mentioned during this pandemic, for example,
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.860]   for some reason more came to you in terms of writing.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.700]   And so do you feel like you're just receiving signals
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:04.940]   from elsewhere or like, do you feel like it's hard work
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.260]   or you're just waiting?
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.980]   - Wow.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.660]   It's not even waiting, no, it's hard work.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:13.540]   It's almost like I said in one of my other lyrics,
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.500]   this is for the MC part of it.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.140]   I said, "MCing to me is easy as breathing."
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.860]   - So it's like breathing.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.700]   - Yeah, it's just like, in fact,
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.380]   this actually was a scientific thing I read about that,
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.540]   and now that you said that, you heard this,
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.080]   I know you've had to hear this.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.120]   They say that,
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.820]   the atoms in our atmosphere,
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.520]   which seem to be infinite in number,
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.180]   are not infinite in the space they occupy,
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.580]   right, 'cause they're in our atmosphere.
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:52.700]   And so there's a chance that at least 1 million atoms
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.260]   that you breathe in your life
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.860]   was breathed by Galileo.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.460]   You heard this before, right?
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:00.380]   - Yeah.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.220]   - Okay.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.140]   - It's very accurate.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.380]   - Okay, how does your body digest it?
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:13.700]   - Well, let's start at the fact that most of the atoms
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:18.300]   that we're made of is from like stars, right,
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.100]   from stars' births, so like we're all really connected
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.740]   fundamentally somehow, and then the atoms
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.940]   that make up our body come and leave,
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.060]   and the same with the cells that are in our body,
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.940]   they die and are reborn, and we don't pay attention
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.340]   to any of that, that all just goes through us.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.180]   I don't know.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:41.980]   That makes me feel like I'm not an individual,
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.620]   I'm just a finger of something much bigger,
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.580]   some much bigger organism.
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.780]   - Well, 'cause you're drinking the coffee there, right?
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:56.020]   You're gonna digest that, you're gonna digest those atoms,
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.900]   whether you're gonna put 'em through the bowel
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.660]   or through the urination, it's coming out,
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.300]   or maybe you'll sweat it out.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.700]   You might sneeze it out, but they're gonna make
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:05.620]   their way out.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:08.020]   How do you digest the atoms if you just breathe
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.660]   in Galileo, right?
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.580]   How do, and that's what I think an artist does.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.940]   I think something in the art, it's like some people
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.540]   eat things and they're gonna gain weight,
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:19.660]   some people ain't gonna gain weight,
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:20.960]   they're gonna gain muscle.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.600]   My, I'm just giving you an analogy here.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.320]   I'm thinking that the artist breathes in
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.680]   and translates it into the art.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.760]   - First, they gotta hear it.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.600]   I think most of us don't hear that.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.240]   Like don't, we receive it, but it just isn't like that.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.560]   - Right, it's not, yeah, we not have the frequency.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.320]   I said this to a lot of artists, and even, you know,
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.320]   we all consider ourselves artists in a certain way,
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.000]   but not, you know, but let's just say
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.040]   there's only one million artists in the world.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.760]   Good.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.160]   (laughing)
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.880]   'Cause there's, you know, it's probably 10,
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.520]   yeah.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.280]   If you divide that into the population,
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.000]   what would that, what part of the table would it be?
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.160]   - A tiny part.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.360]   - Yeah, it might be that, right?
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.760]   - Yeah.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.560]   - And yet it's that that inspires that.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.400]   - Oh yeah.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.940]   - And you know what's so crazy about that though?
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:16.160]   There's also a chance, I'm just going numbers
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.160]   and I'm just hypothesizing with you,
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.880]   but there's also a chance that all of this
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.240]   is actually informing that.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.080]   - Yeah.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.760]   The artist is just watching this, all of this,
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.080]   all the chaos of this.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.600]   Yeah, so it's hard to know where the beauty comes from.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.720]   Is it the artist or the chaos from the?
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.280]   - So I just, I don't have the answer,
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.000]   but if I was to be forced to say an answer,
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.480]   and you're not twisting my arm, but.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.280]   - Yeah, I can if you want me to.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.120]   - No, thank you.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.120]   - I don't see life.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.020]   - Yeah, life.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:54.900]   In "Tower of Woo" you write something about confusion,
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.080]   which I really like.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.640]   "Confusion is a gift from God.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.840]   Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution,
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:06.080]   sit, wait, the information will become clear.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.700]   The confusion is there to guide you.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.480]   Seek detachment and become the producer of your life."
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.600]   So I got to ask you advice.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.040]   If a young person today in high school, college,
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:23.320]   is looking for some advice, what advice could you give them
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.120]   to be a producer of a life they can be proud of?
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.720]   - Read the "Tower of Woo."
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.360]   (both laughing)
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.400]   - Let's start with the Wu-Tang Manual first.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.320]   - Yeah, no, you can do that second.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.560]   - Second? - Yeah.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.400]   I think you can read the "Tower of Woo" first
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.800]   and then do the manual.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.320]   Because the manual is not to put the two books
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.840]   against each other, but the manual is talking about things
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.360]   that is so deeply connected to the music
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.280]   and the people in the "Tower of Woo" goes beyond that.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.600]   So I would actually start there,
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.640]   which is not normally how I prescribe.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.040]   I always tell people, start at knowledge,
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.440]   then go to wisdom.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.280]   But since the "Tower-
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.800]   - Skip ahead to the wisdom, I like it.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.200]   - Yeah, I think for a young man in high school,
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.000]   go to the "Tower of Woo" and then go back.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.320]   It's just like sometimes, you know,
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.560]   you had, you know, like my son's generation,
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:17.080]   they had to watch the second round of "Star Wars."
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:17.920]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.680]   - And then go back, you know what I mean?
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.640]   This generation is watching "The Force Awakens"
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.480]   and then they go back, yeah.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.560]   - But what, because if you just look at your life
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.880]   as an example, that's one heck of a life.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.760]   There's very few lives like it.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.200]   You've created some of the most incredible things
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.280]   artistically in this world.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.600]   Like if somebody, you talk about that, like 1 million,
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.680]   right at the corner of the table.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:48.840]   If somebody once strives, dreams to become one of those,
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.480]   how do they do it?
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.400]   - Well, the beautiful thing is that there are footprints
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:58.240]   left by those who've done it, you know?
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.440]   And the best way is to study that,
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.240]   to study those who've already done what you wanna do.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:10.520]   You know, we live on a civilization,
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.280]   we say this is the greatest country in the world,
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.120]   but our sailors are a pyramid with an eye on it.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.040]   You know what I mean?
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.600]   Because they did it before and they may have failed
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.200]   for some reason or something happens,
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.640]   but it was just a strong enough example, right,
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.680]   to take us further.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.480]   You know, Elon Musk is sitting here trying to do better
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.760]   than what the rocket builders did before.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.200]   He's not the first one to build the rocket.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.000]   He's not the first guy to think of the electric car.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.360]   He's doing it better.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.240]   He's advancing it to the point that whoever picks up
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.680]   after him, maybe they'll get to that flying car.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.620]   So that's the beauty.
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.480]   There's a good verse.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.360]   I love finding verses to say things, to confirm,
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.840]   because this way people could take it verbally,
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.160]   physically, and then maybe even spiritually.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.560]   But Christmas has said a verse, he said,
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:07.000]   "The fastest way to heaven is by spending time
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.600]   "or studying the wise people."
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:10.440]   Meaning the wise people who is living
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:11.940]   and those who live before you.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.840]   - Study the masters.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.320]   Let me ask you a big, perhaps ridiculous question,
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.840]   but give it a shot.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.240]   What is the meaning of this whole thing?
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.600]   What's the meaning of life?
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.440]   - Big question.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.240]   I'm not gonna rush into the answer.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:33.160]   I'm gonna give you somebody else answer first
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.000]   and I'll give you my answer.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.360]   I remember asking this,
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:42.000]   and I don't know, I was 15, 16 years old.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.040]   One of the brothers was studying in mathematics
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:51.080]   and the letter I itself means I, Islam.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:58.960]   I meaning the individual, right?
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.000]   Being in total accord with Islam.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   And let's finish this.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.120]   Then they took the word Islam and they defined it.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:12.120]   That Islam is an Arabic word for peace.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:18.320]   Then they said peace is the absence of confusion.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.680]   Okay?
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.680]   So then they took,
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.200]   and this is something that really hit me
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.640]   when I was, and I never forgot it
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.760]   and I'm gonna decipher it.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.280]   But then they took the word Islam
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.480]   and they broke it down by the letter
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.560]   into a acronym like cash with everything around me.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.800]   They broke it down to I stimulate light and matter.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.880]   And I was like.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.040]   Because what hit me is that if you're not here,
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.240]   then light and matter don't exist to you.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.280]   So you're stimulating it or it ain't here for you.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.240]   So anyway, taking all that.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.920]   But then I said, so what's the meaning of life?
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   And they brothers just said, love Islam forever.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.760]   Right?
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.840]   I ain't saying the religious point of it.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.360]   I'm just saying all those other elements
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.840]   I just spoke about in front of it.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.960]   - I stimulate light and matter.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.800]   I love that.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.640]   That's powerful.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.120]   - And let me give you my definition of life.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:30.040]   I think life is that simply for each and everyone of us.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.640]   To add on to.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:37.400]   - Build, like you said, the masters build on top.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.640]   - Life gave you life, give life back.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.280]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.840]   than talking about the meaning of life.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.680]   RZA, I'm a huge fan.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.520]   It's such a huge honor
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.400]   that you spend your valuable time with me.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.960]   Thank you so much.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.440]   - Peace.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.280]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with RZA.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.720]   To support this podcast,

[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.320]   And now let me leave you with some words from Plato.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   Poetry is nearer to vital truth than history.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.000]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.200]   (upbeat music)
