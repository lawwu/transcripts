[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   By 1945, we were so pissed off at the Japanese.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.080]   We had destroyed their Air Force, we had destroyed their Navy,
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.360]   we had destroyed their Army, and yet they wouldn't surrender.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.720]   The people who are working on AI right now,
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.520]   they are huge fans of yours.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.720]   The way they see the progress in the field
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.920]   is exactly like when they start reading this book.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.000]   Oppenheimer's worst enemy said to me,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.640]   "Robert Oppenheimer was the best lab director I ever knew."
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.600]   And then he chased me out of the house.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.040]   (laughing)
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.720]   You can make a pretty high-level nuclear explosion
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.040]   just by taking two subcritical pieces of uranium.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.840]   All this business about secret designs and so forth
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.000]   is hogwash.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.800]   We're still in a very precarious place.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.000]   And as long as any country in the world has nuclear weapons,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.440]   we're going to continue to be.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.640]   That has been the price of nuclear deterrence.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.600]   - Okay, today I have the great honor
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.520]   of interviewing Richard Rhodes,
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.920]   who is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.960]   of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb,"
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.960]   and most recently, the author of "Energy, A Human History."
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.320]   I'm really excited about this one.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.360]   Let's jump in, actually, at a current event,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.800]   which is the fact that there's a new movie
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.720]   about Oppenheimer coming out,
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   which I understand you've been consulted about.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.320]   What did you think of the trailer?
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.280]   What are your impressions?
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   - They've really done a good job, I think,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.080]   of things like the Trinity test device,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.880]   which was the sphere covered with cables of various kinds.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.480]   And, you know, I had watched "Peaky Blinders,"
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   where the actor who's playing Oppenheimer also appeared,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.080]   and he looks so much like Oppenheimer to start with.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.280]   Oppenheimer was about six feet tall.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.520]   He was rail-thin, not simply in terms of weight,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.080]   but in terms of structure.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.480]   Someone said he could sit
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.600]   in a children's high chair comfortably,
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.320]   but he never weighed more than about 140 pounds,
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.200]   and that quality is there in the actor, I think.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.160]   So who knows?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.560]   It all depends on how the director
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.720]   decided to tell the story.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.440]   There are so many aspects of the story,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.600]   you could never possibly squeeze them
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.640]   into one two-hour movie.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   I think that we're waiting for the multi-part series
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.440]   that would really tell a lot more of the story,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.040]   not the whole story.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.520]   But it looks exciting.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.680]   We'll see.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.320]   There've been some terrible depictions of Oppenheimer,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   been some terrible depictions of the Bond program,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   and maybe they'll get this one right.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.000]   - Yeah, yeah, hopefully.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.880]   You know, it is always great when you get an actor
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.760]   who resembles their role so well.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.080]   Bryan Cranston, for example, played LBJ,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.680]   and they have the same physical characteristics
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.200]   of the BDIs, the big ears.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.960]   But, okay, so in the case of Oppenheimer,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.640]   one question I had, since we're talking about him,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680]   I understand that there's evidence that's come out
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.520]   that he wasn't a communist spy,
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   or he wasn't directly a communist spy,
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.640]   but is there any possibility
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.800]   that he was leaking information to the Soviets,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.160]   or in some way helping the Soviet program?
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.080]   He was a communist sympathizer, right?
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.840]   - He had been during the 1930s,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   but less for the theory, if you will,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.800]   than for the practical business
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.840]   of helping Jews escape from Nazi Germany.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.200]   One of the loves of his life,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   who was busy working on extracting Jews from Europe
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.240]   during the '30s as well,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.640]   was a member of the Communist Party,
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.360]   and Jean Tadlock.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.080]   And she, I think, encouraged him to come to meetings.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.160]   But I don't think there's any possibility whatsoever
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   that he either shared information
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.600]   or was in any way affiliated.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.080]   In fact, he said he read Marx on a train trip,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.120]   people traveled by train in those days,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.200]   between Berkeley and Washington one time,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   and thought it was a bunch of hooey, just ridiculous.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.160]   He was a very smart man,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   and he read the book with an eye to its logic,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.440]   and he didn't think there was much there.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.920]   So I think you have to see him as,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.240]   you know, he really didn't know anything
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.120]   about human beings and their struggles.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.280]   He was born into considerable wealth.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.880]   There were Impressionist paintings
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.120]   all over his family apartments in New York City.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.200]   His father had made a great deal of money
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   cornering the market, so to speak,
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.600]   on uniform linings for military uniforms
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.400]   during and before the First World War.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.120]   So there was a lot of wealth.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.320]   I think his income, if I remember,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.040]   and if I'm right in this,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.200]   when he was during the war years and before,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.720]   was somewhere around $100,000 a month,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.760]   and that's a lot of money in the 1930s.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   So he just lived in his head for most of his early years
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.160]   until he got to Berkeley and discovered
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   that prime students of his were living on cat food.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.640]   I mean, you know, cans of god-awful cat food
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.060]   because they couldn't afford anything else.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.400]   And once he understood
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   that there was great suffering in the world,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.080]   he jumped in on this.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.880]   He always did when he became interested in something.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.800]   So all of those things come together.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.280]   I do think his brother,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.800]   well, there's no question that his brother, Frank,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.600]   was a member of the party, as was Frank's wife.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.000]   And the whole question of Oppenheimer's
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.760]   lying to the security people during the Second World War,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.360]   which he did, about who approached him
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.160]   and who was maybe trying to get him
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.420]   to sign on to some espionage,
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.960]   I think was primarily an effort
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.280]   to cover up his brother's involvement.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.600]   Not that his brothers gave away any secrets.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.240]   I don't think he did.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   But if the army security had really understood
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.680]   Frank Oppenheimer's involvement,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.360]   he probably would have been shipped off to the Aleutians
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.740]   or some other distant place for the duration of the war.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.160]   And Oppenheimer, quite correctly, wanted Frank around.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   He was someone he trusted.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160]   - Let's start talking about the making of the bomb.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.840]   One question I have is, if World War II doesn't happen,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.980]   is there any possibility
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.840]   that the bomb just never gets developed and nobody bothers?
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.160]   - That's really a good question,
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.680]   and I've wondered over the years.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.240]   But the more I look at the sequence of events,
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.440]   the more I think it would have been essentially inevitable,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.560]   though perhaps not such an accelerated program.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.680]   The bomb was pushed so hard during the Second World War
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.760]   because we thought the Germans
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.400]   had already started working on one.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.920]   Nuclear fission had been discovered in Nazi Germany,
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.240]   in Berlin in 1938,
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.840]   nine months before the beginning
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.280]   of the Second World War in Europe.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.960]   So from our perspective,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   without the kind of elaborate national security programs
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.080]   that we have developed since then,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.680]   I mean, technological surveillance,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.880]   none of that was available during the war.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.280]   The only way you could find out something
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.720]   was to send in a spy or have a mole or something human.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.800]   And we didn't have that, evidently.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.580]   So we didn't know where the Germans were,
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.880]   but we knew the bomb had, not the bomb,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.840]   but the basic physics reaction that could lead to a bomb
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.480]   had been discovered there a year or more
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.280]   before anybody else in the West
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.440]   got started thinking about it.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.480]   So there was that, most of all, to push the urgency.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.000]   And there would not, of course,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   have been that in your hypothetical.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.440]   However, as soon as good physicists
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   thought about the reaction that leads to nuclear fission,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.260]   where a slow neutron, room-temperature neutron,
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.480]   very little energy,
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.540]   bumps into the nucleus of a uranium-235 atom,
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:23.580]   Isidore Rabi, one of the great physicists of this era,
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.800]   said it would have been like the moon struck the earth.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.240]   That kind of massive response.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.760]   So a very little energy in and a huge amount of energy out.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.000]   The reaction was, physicists say, fiercely exothermic,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.840]   meaning it puts out a lot more energy
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.880]   than you have to use to get it started.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   Once they did the numbers on that,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.800]   and once they figured out how much uranium
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.080]   you would need to have in one place to make a bomb,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.680]   or to make fission get going,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.800]   and once they were sure
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.000]   that there would be a chain reaction,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.720]   meaning a couple of neutrons
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.960]   would come out of the reaction from one atom,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.360]   and those two or three would go on
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.280]   and bump into other uranium atoms,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.880]   which would then fission them,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   and you'd get a geometric exponential.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.320]   You'd get one, two, four, eight, 16, 32, and off from there.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.040]   So in about 80 generations,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.000]   for most of our bombs today, I'm sure,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.880]   the initial fission leads to, in 80 generations,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.520]   to a city-busting explosion.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.340]   And then they had to figure out
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.720]   how much material they would need,
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.560]   and that's something the Germans
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.100]   never really figured out, fortunately, for the rest of us.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.760]   They were still working in the idea
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.120]   that somehow a reactor would be what you would build.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.600]   When Niels Bohr, the great Danish physicist,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   escaped from Denmark in 1943 when the Germans invaded
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.480]   and came to first England and then the United States,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.320]   he brought with him a sort of a rough sketch
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.240]   that Werner Heisenberg, the leader of science,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.800]   the leading scientist in the German program,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.400]   had handed him in the course of trying to find out
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.960]   what Bohr knew about what America was doing,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.400]   and he showed it to the guys at Los Alamos,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.640]   and Hans Bethe, one of the great Nobel Laureate physicists
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.720]   in the group, said, "Are the Germans trying
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.120]   "to throw a reactor down on us?"
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.120]   Well, I mean, you can make a reactor blow up.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.760]   We saw that at Chernobyl,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.240]   but it's not a nuclear explosion on the scale
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.460]   that we're talking about with the bomb.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.460]   So when a couple of these emigre Jewish physicists
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.920]   from Nazi Germany were whiling away their time in England
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.600]   after they escaped,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.960]   because they were still technically enemy aliens
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.840]   and therefore could not be introduced
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.720]   to top-secret discussions, one of them asked the other,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   "Well, how much would we need of pure uranium-235,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.840]   "this rare isotope of uranium that chain-reacts?
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.120]   "How much would we need to make a bomb?"
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.520]   And they did the numbers and they came up with one pound,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.680]   which was startling to them.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.600]   Of course, it is more than that.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.280]   It's about 125 pounds, but that's just a softball.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.600]   That's not that much material.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.920]   And then they did the numbers about what it would cost
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.480]   to build a factory to pull this one rare isotope
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.240]   of uranium out of the natural metal,
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.640]   which has several isotopes mixed together.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.080]   And they figured it wouldn't cost more
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.880]   than it would cost to build a battleship,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.400]   which is not that much money for a country at war.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.600]   Certainly the British had plenty of battleships
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.200]   at that point in time.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.680]   So they put all this together and they wrote a report,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.800]   which they handed through their superior physicist
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.600]   at Manchester University, where they were based,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.040]   who quickly realized how important this was.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.640]   The United States lagged behind
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.080]   because we were not yet at war, but the British were.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.400]   London was being bombed in the Blitz.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.600]   So they saw the urgency, first of all,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.560]   of beating Germany to the punch,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.960]   second of all of the possibility of building a bomb.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.640]   In this report, these two scientists wrote
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.040]   that there would be no physical structure
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.640]   that they could think of that you could build
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.000]   that would protect you against a bomb
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.280]   of such ferocious explosive power.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.600]   So they said in this report from 1940,
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.760]   understand this is long before
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.880]   even the Manhattan Project got started.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.200]   They said in this report, the only way we could think of
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.120]   to protect you against a bomb
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.680]   would be to have a bomb of similar destructive force
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.320]   that could be threatened for use
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.600]   if the other side attacked you.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.480]   That's deterrence.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.080]   That's a concept that was developed
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   even before the war began in the United States.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.840]   You put all those pieces together
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.200]   and you have a situation where you have to build a bomb
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.440]   because whoever builds the first bomb, theoretically,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.840]   could prevent you from building more
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.760]   or prevent you, another country, from building any
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.800]   and could dominate the world.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.000]   And the notion in particular of Adolf Hitler
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.600]   dominating the world, the Third Reich,
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.880]   with nuclear weapons was horrifying.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.320]   So put all that together and I think the answer is
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.360]   every country, this is the case actually,
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.160]   every country that had the technological infrastructure
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.880]   to even remotely have the possibility
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.200]   of building everything you'd have to build
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.320]   to get the material for a bomb
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.560]   started work on thinking about it
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.080]   as soon as nuclear fission was announced to the world.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.400]   France, the Soviet Union, Great Britain,
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.320]   the United States, even Japan.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.200]   So I think it would have happened
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.680]   but maybe not so quickly.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.440]   - Yeah, I think you talk in the book
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.600]   that for some reason the Germans thought
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.520]   that the critical mass was something like 10 tons.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.160]   They had done some miscalculation.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.320]   - A reactor. - Right.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.800]   You also have some interesting stories in the book
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.000]   about how different countries found out
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.240]   the Americans were working on the bomb.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.320]   For example, the Russians saw that all these physicists
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.880]   and chemists and metallurgists
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.760]   who were at the top of their field
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.920]   were no longer publishing.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.360]   They had just like gone offline.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.680]   And so they figured, well, something must be going on.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.560]   I'm not sure if you're aware, by the way,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.480]   the subject of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb"
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   in and of itself is incredibly fascinating,
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.040]   but also this book has become a cult classic in AI.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   Are you not familiar with this?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.720]   - No.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.320]   - The people who are working on AI right now,
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.920]   they're huge fans of yours.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.360]   They're the ones who initially recommended the book to me
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.040]   because the way they see the progress in the field
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.240]   is exactly like when they start reading this book,
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.440]   it's like you start off with these initial scientific hints
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.920]   that with deep learning, for example,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.520]   here's something that can teach itself any function
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.480]   similar to Slizzard noticing the nuclear chain reaction.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.920]   You progress to somebody figuring out in AI,
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.960]   there's these scaling laws that say that
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.280]   if you make the model this much bigger,
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.920]   it gets this much better at reasoning,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.800]   at predicting text and so on.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.840]   And then you can extrapolate this curve
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   and you can see, huh, we get two more orders of magnitude
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.040]   and we get to something that looks like
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.560]   human level intelligence.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.080]   Anyway, so a lot of the people who are working in AI
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.480]   have become huge fans of your book because of this reason.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.280]   They see a lot of analogies in the next few years from,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.000]   they must be like page 400 in their minds
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.640]   of where the Manhattan Project was.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.640]   - We must later on talk about unintended consequences.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.800]   I find the subject absolutely fascinating.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.600]   I think my next book might be called
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.880]   "Unintended Consequences."
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.680]   - So you mentioned that a big reason
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.400]   why many of the scientists wanted to work on the bomb,
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.520]   especially the Jewish emigres,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.040]   was because they were worried about Hitler getting it first.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.320]   Now, at some point, as you mentioned,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.960]   it was becoming obvious,
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.520]   maybe, I don't know what the exact year would be, 1943, '44,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.640]   that Hitler, the Nazis were not close to the bomb.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.160]   And I believe that almost none of the scientists quit
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.960]   after they found out that the Nazis weren't close.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.120]   So why didn't more of them say,
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.360]   "Oh, I guess we were wrong.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.840]   "The Nazis aren't gonna get it.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.680]   "We don't need to be working on it."
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.280]   - There was only one, Joseph Redblatt,
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.240]   when he heard that Germany had been defeated.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.000]   In May of 1945, he packed up and left.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.160]   General Groves,
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.720]   the imperious Army Corps of Engineers general
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.120]   who ran the entire Manhattan Project, was really upset.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.720]   He was afraid he'd spill the beans.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.320]   So he threatened to have him arrested and put in jail,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.520]   but Redblatt was quite determined not to stay any longer.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.760]   He was not interested in building bombs
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.000]   to aggrandize the national power
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.840]   of the United States of America,
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.600]   which is perfectly understandable.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.560]   But why was no one else?
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   By then, let me tell it in terms of Victor Weisskopf.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.040]   Victor Weisskopf was an Austrian theoretical physicist
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.080]   who, like the others, escaped when the Germans,
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.680]   then the Nazis took over Germany and then Austria
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.840]   and ended up at Los Alamos.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.160]   Weisskopf wrote later,
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.000]   "There we were at Los Alamos," he said,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.920]   "in the midst of the darkest part of our science."
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.960]   We had been, he said, he meant,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.480]   they were working on a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.680]   Certainly, that's pretty dark.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.800]   He said before it had almost seemed like a spiritual quest.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.920]   And it's really interesting how different physics
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.680]   was considered before and after the Second World War.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.200]   Before the war, one of the physicists in America
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.040]   named Louis Alvarez told me,
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   when he got his PhD in physics at Berkeley in 1937 or so
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.360]   and went to cocktail parties,
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.720]   people would say, "What's your degree in?"
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.360]   He would tell them, "Chemistry."
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.040]   I said, "Louis, why?"
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.960]   He said, "Because I didn't really have to explain
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.240]   "what physics was."
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.840]   That's how little known, if you will,
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   this kind of science was at that time.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   There were only about 1,000 physicists
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.040]   in the whole world in 1900.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.080]   And by the mid '30s, there were a lot more, of course.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.200]   There'd been a lot of nuclear physics
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.600]   and other kinds of physics done by then.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.160]   But it was still arcane.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.880]   And they didn't feel as if they were doing anything
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.520]   mean or dirty or warlike at all.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.440]   They were just pure science.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.840]   Then nuclear fission came along.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.440]   It was publicized worldwide.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.920]   People, I think, who've been born
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.680]   since after the Second World War don't realize.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.400]   It was not a secret at first.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.680]   The news was published first in a German chemistry journal,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.160]   Natura Wissenschaften,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   and then in the British journal Nature,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.600]   and then in American journals.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.360]   And there were headlines in the New York Times,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.160]   in the Los Angeles Times,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.480]   in the Chicago Tribune, and all over the world.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.600]   Here at last was, people had been reading about
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.560]   and thinking about how to get energy
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   out of the atomic nucleus for a long time.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.880]   It was clear there was a lot there.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.080]   All you had to do was get a piece of radium
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.480]   and see that it glowed in the dark.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.000]   You didn't plug it into a wall.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.360]   It just sat there, a chunk of this material,
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.080]   and if you held it in your hand, it would burn you.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.680]   So where'd that energy come from?
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.520]   Well, the physicists realized it all came
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.040]   from the nucleus of the atom,
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.800]   which is a very small part of the whole thing.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   1/100,000 the diameter of the whole atom is the nucleus.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.400]   Someone in England described it as about the size
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.720]   of a fly in a cathedral.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.000]   Most of the energy that's involved,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.400]   all of the energy that's involved in chemical reactions,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.960]   comes from the electron cloud that's around the nucleus.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.120]   But the nucleus was the center of powerful forces.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.720]   This was clear.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.760]   But the question was, how do you get them out?
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   The only way that the nucleus had been studied up to 1938
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   was by bombarding it with protons,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.120]   which have the same electric charge as the nucleus,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.360]   positive charge, which means they repelled by it.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.920]   So you had to accelerate them to high speeds
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.160]   with various versions of the big machines
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   that we've all become aware of since then.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.960]   The cyclotron, most obviously, built in the '30s,
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.120]   but there were others as well.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.880]   And even then, at best, you could chip a little piece off.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.080]   You could change an atom one step up
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.760]   or one step down the periodic table.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.360]   This was the classic transmutation
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.680]   of medieval alchemy, to be sure.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.800]   But it wasn't much.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.080]   You didn't get much out.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   So everyone came to think of the nucleus of the atom
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.400]   as like a little rock that you really had to hammer it hard
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.280]   to get anything to happen with it
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.120]   because it was so small and dense.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:54.000]   That's why nuclear fission, with this slow neutron
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   drifting in and then going, sort of floating into it,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.480]   and then the whole thing just goes bang,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.880]   was so, so startling to everybody.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.280]   So startling that when it happened,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.400]   most of the physicists who would later work on the bomb
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.640]   and others as well, realized that they had missed
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.120]   a reaction that was something they could have staged
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.160]   on a lab bench with the equipment on the shelf.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.560]   Didn't have to invent anything new, didn't have,
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.160]   just, and Louis Alvarez, again, this physicist at Berkeley,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.440]   told me, he said, "I was getting my hair cut."
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.320]   When I read the news in the newspaper,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.920]   I pulled off the robe in half with my haircut,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.720]   ran to my lab, pulled some equipment off the shelf,
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.880]   set it up, and there it was.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.320]   So he said, "I discovered nuclear fission,
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.800]   "but it was two days too late."
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.120]   (laughing)
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.360]   And that happened all over.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.720]   People were just hitting themselves on the head
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.640]   and saying what, well, Niels Bohr said,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.800]   "What fools we've all been."
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.320]   So this is a good example, by the way, in science,
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.720]   of if your model is wrong, the one you're working with
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.760]   in your head, well, it doesn't lead you down the right path.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.800]   There was only one physicist who really was thinking
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.560]   the right way about the uranium atom,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.720]   and that was Niels Bohr.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.320]   He realized somewhere in the '30s that the nucleus
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.440]   of the uranium atom, the last natural element
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.760]   in the periodic table, why is it the last one?
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.560]   What is different about the others that would come later?
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.840]   Well, he visualized it as a liquid drop.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.320]   I always like to say visualize it as a water-filled balloon.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.760]   It's wobbly, it's not very stable.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.120]   The proton in the nucleus are held together
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.360]   by something called the strong force,
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.360]   but they still have the repellent positive electric charge
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.000]   that's trying to push them apart.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.800]   When you get enough of them into a nucleus,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.080]   it's almost a standoff between the strong force
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.720]   and all the electrical charge.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.240]   So it is like a wobbly balloon of water.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.600]   And then you see why a neutron just falling in
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.720]   to the nucleus would set it to wobbling around,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.520]   and in one of its configurations,
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.200]   it might take a dumbbell shape.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.440]   And then you'd have basically two charged atoms
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.480]   just barely connected, trying to push each other apart.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.840]   And often enough, they went the whole way.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.960]   When they did that, these two new elements,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   half the weight of uranium, way down the periodic table,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.640]   would reconfigure themselves into two separate nuclei.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.560]   And in doing so, they would release some energy.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.200]   And that was the energy that came out of the reaction,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.160]   and it was a lot of energy.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.120]   So Bohr thought about the model in the right way.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.360]   The chemists who actually discovered nuclear fusion
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.080]   didn't know what they were gonna get.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.760]   They were just bombarding a solution of uranium nitrate
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.000]   with neutrons, thinking,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.080]   well, maybe we can make a new element.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.240]   Maybe a first man-made element will come out of our work.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.920]   So when they found these,
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.200]   as they analyzed the solution they had
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.120]   after they bombarded it,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.920]   they found these elements like,
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.320]   I never can remember the names of the elements,
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.160]   but they're halfway down the periodic table.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.240]   They shouldn't have been there.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.920]   And they were totally baffled.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.240]   What is this doing here?
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   Did we contaminate our solution? No.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.880]   They had been working with a physicist named Lisa Meitner,
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.280]   who was a theoretical physicist, an Austrian Jew.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.120]   She had gotten out of Nazi Germany not long before,
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.080]   but they were still in correspondence with her,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.920]   so they wrote her a letter.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   I held that letter in my hand when I visited Berlin,
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.640]   and I was in tears.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.560]   You know, you don't hold history
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.240]   of this scale in your hands very often.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.560]   And it said, in German, it said, basically,
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.520]   we found this strange reaction in our solution.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.840]   What are these elements doing there
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.080]   that don't belong there?
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.960]   And she went for a walk in a little village
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.160]   in Western Sweden with her nephew, Otto Frisch,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.200]   who was also a nuclear physicist.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.640]   And they thought about it for a while,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.240]   and they remembered Bohr's model,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.200]   this wobbly, water-filled balloon,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.000]   and they suddenly saw what could happen.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.200]   And that's then where the news came from,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.000]   the physics news as opposed to the chemistry news
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.520]   from the guys in Germany that was published
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.360]   in all the Western journals and all the newspapers.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.480]   And, you know, everybody had been talking
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.640]   about what you could do for years before
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.920]   if you had that kind of energy.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.520]   A glass of this material would drive the Queen Mary
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.640]   back and forth from New York to London 20 times
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.880]   and so forth.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.240]   Your automobile could run for months.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.280]   No.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.720]   But you see, people were kind of getting thinking
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.080]   about what would be possible
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.840]   if you had that much available energy.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.080]   And, of course, people had thought about reactors.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.880]   Oh, and again, when the news reached Berkeley,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.280]   while Louis Alvarez was running over to run the experiment,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.880]   Robert Oppenheimer, who was a professor there,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.560]   one of his students told me,
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.960]   his response was within a week,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.240]   he said Robert had a drawing on the blackboard,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.640]   he said a rather bad drawing,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.840]   of both a reactor and a bomb.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:36.360]   So again, because the energy was so great,
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.920]   the physics was pretty obvious.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.600]   Whether it would actually happen
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.160]   depended on some other things,
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.960]   like could you make it chain react?
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.480]   But fundamentally, the idea was all there
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.160]   at the very beginning.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.800]   And everybody jumped on it.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.840]   - How do you think about the spectrum of damage
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.880]   caused by the different weapons that have become available
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.200]   and were available at the time?
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.120]   So, first of all, it is actually the best history
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.800]   of World War II I've ever read.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.200]   Which is, I mean, it's about the atomic bomb,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.840]   but it's interspersed with the events
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.040]   that are happening in World War II,
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.000]   which motivate the creation of the bomb
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.640]   or the release of it,
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.520]   like why it had to be dropped on Japan,
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.000]   given the Japanese response.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.600]   Anyways, but the first third
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.080]   is about the scientific roots of the physics.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.720]   And it's also the best book I've read
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.560]   about the history of science in the early 20th century.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.760]   And the organization of it.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.480]   I mean, there's some really interesting stuff in there.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.720]   For example, there's a passage where you talk about
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.960]   how there was a real master-apprentice model
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.680]   in early science,
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.240]   where if you wanted to learn
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.560]   to do this kind of experimentation,
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.640]   you would go to Amsterdam,
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   where the master of it is residing.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.000]   It's much more individual-focused.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.840]   - Yeah, the whole European model of graduate study,
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.200]   which is basically the wandering scholar
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.880]   could go wherever you wanted to
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.800]   and sign up with whoever was willing to have you sign up.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.480]   - But so the question I wanted to ask
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.040]   regarding the history you made of World War II in general
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.640]   is there's one way you can think about the atom bomb
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.360]   is that it is completely different
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.760]   from any sort of weaponry
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.600]   that has been developed before it.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.640]   Another way we can think of it
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.480]   is there's this like spectrum,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.600]   where on one end you have the thermonuclear bomb,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.400]   in the middle you have the atom bomb,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.320]   and on this end you have the firebombing
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.840]   of cities like Hamburg and Dresden and Tokyo.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.160]   Do you think of these as completely different categories
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.160]   or does it seem like a sort of escalating gradient to you?
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.320]   - I think until you get to the hydrogen bomb,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.960]   it's really an escalating gradient.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.120]   The hydrogen bomb, which can be made arbitrarily large,
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.960]   the biggest one ever tested was 56 million tons
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.000]   of TNT equivalent, 56 megatons.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.720]   The Soviets tested that.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.480]   That had a fireball more than five miles in diameter,
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.080]   just the fireball.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.280]   So that's really an order of magnitude change.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.600]   But the other one's known.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.480]   In fact, I think one of the real problems,
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.080]   this has not been much discussed and it should be,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   when American officials went to Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.840]   after the war, well, one of them said later,
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.040]   "I got on a plane in Tokyo.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.960]   We flew down the long green archipelago
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.400]   of the Japanese home island.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:46.280]   When I left Tokyo, it was all gray, broken roof tiles
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.200]   from the firebombing and the other bombings.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.360]   And then all this greenery.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.320]   And then when we flew over Hiroshima,
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.400]   it was just gray, broken roof tiles again."
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.280]   So the scale of the bombing with one bomb
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.560]   in the case, let's say of Hiroshima,
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.720]   was not that different from the scale of the firebombings
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.120]   that had preceded it with tens of thousands of bombs.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.400]   The difference was it was just one plane.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.680]   In fact, the people in Hiroshima didn't even bother
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.800]   to go into their bomb shelters
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.440]   because one plane had always just been a weather plane
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.800]   coming over to check the weather
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.120]   before the bombers took off.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.000]   So they didn't see any reason to hide or protect themselves,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.200]   which was one of the reasons so many people were killed.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.480]   The guys at Los Alamos had planned
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   on the Japanese being in their bomb shelters.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.120]   They did everything they could think of
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   to make the bomb as much like ordinary bombing
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.000]   as they could.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.600]   And for example, it was exploded high enough above ground,
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.720]   1800 yards, I believe, roughly,
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.520]   that the fireball that would form
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.360]   from this really very small nuclear weapon,
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.840]   tactical scale by modern standards,
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   15 kilotons, 15,000 tons of TNT equivalent,
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.200]   that the fireball wouldn't touch the ground
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.720]   and stir up dirt and irradiate it
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.400]   and cause massive radioactive fallout.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.040]   It never did that.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.880]   They weren't sure there would be any fallout.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.720]   They didn't think that,
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.440]   they thought the plutonium in the bomb over Nagasaki now
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.560]   would just kind of turn into a gas and blow away.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.160]   That's not exactly what happened,
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.520]   but people don't seem to realize,
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.080]   and it's never been emphasized enough,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.800]   these first bombs, like all nuclear weapons,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.560]   were firebombs.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.600]   Their job was to start mass fires,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.880]   just exactly like all the six-pound incendiaries
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.800]   that had been destroying every major city in Japan by then.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.120]   Every major city above 50,000 population
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.520]   had already been burned out.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.160]   The only reason Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.720]   were around to be atomic bombed
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.040]   is because they'd been set aside from the target list
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.640]   because General Groves wanted to know
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.000]   what the damage effects would be.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.440]   The only way that he could study that,
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.640]   obviously the bomb that was tested in the desert
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.160]   didn't tell you anything.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.720]   Killed a lot of rabbits,
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.640]   knocked down a lot of cactus,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.200]   melted some sand,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.560]   but you couldn't see its effect on buildings and on people.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.200]   So the bomb was delivery intended to be
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.240]   as much not like poison gas, for example,
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.520]   as because we didn't want the reputation
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.000]   for being people like the war in Europe
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.080]   during the First World War
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.960]   where people were killing each other with horrible gases.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.000]   We just wanted people to think this was another bombing.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.120]   So in that sense, it was.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.960]   Of course there was radioactivity
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.320]   and of course some people were killed by it,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.760]   but they calculated that the people
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.320]   who would be killed by the irradiation,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.000]   the prompt neutron radiation from the original fireball
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.760]   would be close enough to the epicenter of the explosion
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.160]   that they would be killed by the blast
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.040]   or the flash of light, which was 10,000 degrees,
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.040]   the world's worst sunburn.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.200]   You know, you've seen stories of people walking around
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.880]   with their skin hanging off their arms.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.160]   I've had sunburns almost that bad,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.960]   but not over my whole body, obviously.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.320]   You know, where the skin actually blisters and peels off.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.400]   That was a sunburn from a 10,000 degree artificial sun.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.640]   - So that's not the heat, that's just the light.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.360]   - That's the light, yeah. - Wow.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.920]   - Well, light and heat, 10,000 degrees.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.720]   Radiant light, radiant heat.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:43.120]   But the blast itself only extended out a certain distance.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.760]   It was fire.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.720]   And all the nuclear weapons that have ever been designed
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.080]   are basically firebombs.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.920]   That's important because the military in the United States
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.000]   after the war, probably everywhere,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.200]   not being able to figure out how to calculate
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.280]   the effects of this weapon in a reliable way
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.360]   that matched their previous experience
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.600]   would calculate only the blast effects of a nuclear weapon
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.680]   when they figured their targets.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.560]   That's why we had what came to be called overkill, really.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.840]   I mean, we wanted redundancy, of course, a stockpile.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.720]   But I mean, 60 nuclear weapons on Moscow
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.000]   was way beyond what would be necessary
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.520]   to destroy even that big a city
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.640]   because they really calculated the blast.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.640]   But in fact, if you exploded a 300 kiloton nuclear warhead
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.680]   over the Pentagon at 3,000 feet,
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.280]   it would blast all the way out to the Capitol,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.520]   which isn't all that far.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.760]   But if you counted the fire, it would start a mass fire
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.400]   that would reach all the way out to the Beltway
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.800]   and burn everything between the epicenter of the weapon
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.080]   and the Beltway.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   All organic matter would be totally burned out,
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.920]   leaving nothing but mineral matter, basically.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.400]   - I wanna emphasize two things you said
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.480]   because they really hit me in reading the book,
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.040]   and I'm not sure if the audience has fully integrated them.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.640]   The first is, in the book, the military planners in Groves,
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.720]   they talk about needing to use the bomb
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.280]   sooner rather than later
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.800]   because they were running out of cities in Japan
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.480]   where there are enough buildings left
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.920]   that it would be worth bombing in the first place.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.920]   - Right.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.760]   - Which is insane.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.320]   Like an entire city's already, I'm sorry,
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.240]   an entire country is almost already destroyed
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.760]   from firebombing alone.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.600]   And the second thing about the category difference
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.240]   between thermonuclear and atomic bombs,
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.480]   I forget his name, but the nuclear planner
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.640]   who wrote "The Doomsday Machine,"
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.360]   in one of his passages, he talks about,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.400]   people don't understand that the atom bomb,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.000]   in the case of a hydrogen bomb,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.920]   the atom bomb, which the pictures we see
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.360]   of Nagasaki and Hiroshima,
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.880]   that is simply the detonator of a modern nuclear bomb,
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.240]   which is an insane thing to think about.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.240]   So, for example, 10 and 15 kilotons
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.440]   is the Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.120]   And the Tsar bomb, which was 50 megatons,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.600]   so more than a thousand times as much.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.720]   And that wasn't even as big as they could make it.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.560]   - Right.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.360]   - They kept the uranium tamper off
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.440]   because they didn't want to destroy all of Siberia.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.360]   (laughs)
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.200]   But so you could get over a hundred,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.640]   more than 10,000 times as powerful.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.840]   - When Teller, Edward Teller,
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.120]   one of the dark forces in this story,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.560]   Teller was the co-inventor of the hydrogen bomb.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.720]   And later on, when he was consulting with our military,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.480]   just for his own sake, he sat down and calculated
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.280]   how big could you make a hydrogen bomb?
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.160]   He came up with a thousand megatons.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.200]   And then he looked at the effects.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   Thousand megatons would be a fireball 10 miles in diameter.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.800]   And the atmosphere is only 10 miles deep.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.560]   So he figured that it would just be a waste of energy
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.400]   because it would all blow out into space.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.920]   Some of it would go laterally, of course,
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.400]   but most of it would just go out into space.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.680]   So he figured that a bomb more than a hundred megatons
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.360]   would just be totally a waste of time.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.400]   Of course, a hundred megaton bomb is also a total waste
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.760]   because there's no target on earth big enough
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.960]   to justify that from a military point of view.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.280]   Robert Oppenheimer, when he had his security clearance
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.600]   questioned and then, of course, lifted
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.760]   when he was being punished for having resisted
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.160]   the development of the hydrogen bomb,
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.520]   was asked by the interrogator at the security hearing,
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.720]   "Well, Dr. Oppenheimer,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.480]   if you'd had a hydrogen bomb for Hiroshima,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.840]   well, wouldn't you have used it?"
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.560]   And Oppenheimer said, "No."
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.840]   The interrogator said, "Why is that?"
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.040]   Said, "Because the target was too small."
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.960]   So I hope that scene is in the film.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.720]   I'm sure it will be.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   So after the war, when our bomb planners
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:18.040]   and some of our scientists went into Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.000]   just about as soon as the surrender was signed,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.880]   what they were interested in
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.200]   was the scale of destruction, of course.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.920]   And the city, those two cities didn't look that different
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.920]   from the other cities that had been firebombed
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.960]   with small incendiaries and ordinary high explosives.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.200]   They went home to Washington, the policymakers,
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   with the thought that,
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.000]   "Ah, these bombs are not so destructive after all."
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.680]   They had been touted as city busters, basically,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.120]   and they weren't.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.320]   They didn't completely burn out cities.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.520]   They were not certainly more destructive
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.840]   than the firebombing campaign,
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.480]   when everything of more than 50,000 population
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.600]   had already been destroyed.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.120]   That, in turn, influenced the judgment
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.920]   about what we needed to do vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.640]   When the Soviets got the bomb in 1949,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.920]   there was a general sense that,
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.440]   one, you could fight a war with nuclear weapons,
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.400]   deterrence or not.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.320]   Two, you would need quite a few of them to do it right.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.240]   And the Air Force, once it realized
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.240]   that it could aggrandize its own share of the federal budget
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.720]   by cornering the market, if you will,
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.880]   on delivering nuclear weapons,
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   very quickly decided that they would only look
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.120]   at the blast effect and not the fire effect.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.880]   It's like tying one hand behind your back.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.000]   Most of it was a fire effect.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.200]   So that's where they came up with numbers
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   like we need 60 of these to take out Moscow.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.240]   And the more bombs, this is what the Air Force figured out
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   by the late 1940s, the more bombs, the more targets,
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:16.160]   the more bombs, the more bombs, the more planes,
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.440]   the more planes, the biggest share of the budget.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.440]   So by the mid-1950s, the Air Force commanded 47%
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.840]   of the federal defense budget.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.720]   And the other branches of services,
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.920]   which had not gone nuclear, particularly by then,
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.000]   woke up and said, "We'd better find some use
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.600]   "for these weapons in our branches of service."
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.640]   So the Army discovered that it needed nuclear weapons,
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.360]   tactical weapons for field use, fired out of cannons.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.200]   There was even one that was fired
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.000]   out of a shoulder-mounted rifle.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.120]   There was a satchel charge that two men could carry.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.240]   It weighed about 150 pounds.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.200]   That would be used to dig a ditch
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.920]   so that Soviet tanks couldn't cross into Germany.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.120]   All sorts of wonderful, and of course the Navy by then
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.960]   had been working hard with General Rickover
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.720]   on building a nuclear submarine
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.560]   that could carry ballistic missiles underwater
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.960]   in total security.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.240]   No way anybody could trace those submarines
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.200]   once they were quiet enough.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.520]   And a nuclear reactor is very quiet.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.520]   It just sits there with neutrons running around making heat.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.520]   So the other services jumped in and this famous triad,
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.280]   you know, we must have these three different kinds
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.560]   of nuclear weapons, baloney.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.680]   - Interesting, interesting.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.160]   - We would be perfectly safe
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.200]   if we only had our nuclear submarines.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.040]   - Yeah.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.000]   - And only one or two of those.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.880]   One nuclear submarine can take out all of Europe
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.720]   or all of the Soviet Union.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.600]   - Because it has multiple nukes on it?
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   - Because they have 16 intercontinental ballistic missiles
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.240]   with MIRV warheads, at least three per missile.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.760]   - Wow.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.280]   I had a former guest, Richard Hernania,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.080]   has a book about foreign policy
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.400]   where he points out that our model of thinking
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.000]   about why countries do the things they do,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.320]   especially in foreign affairs is wrong
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.280]   because we think of them as these rational actors,
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.600]   individual rational actors,
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.760]   when in fact it's these like competing factions
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.920]   within the government.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.360]   And in fact, you see this especially in the case of Japan
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.720]   in World War II, where, I forgot the name of the book.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.200]   There was a great book of Japan leading up to World War II
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.520]   where they talk about how, I mean, it was basically the,
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.840]   you know, I forget which branch of the Japanese military,
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.080]   they needed, you know, more oil to continue their campaign
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.760]   in Manchuria and so they forced these other branches
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.720]   to escalate, but yeah, that's so interesting.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.880]   That's why we have so many nukes
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.920]   is that the different branches are competing for funding.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.560]   - Well, you know, the Air Force dream
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   ever since the First World War,
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.160]   ever since what's his name, Dewey,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   an Italian theorist of air power.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.520]   He had been in the trenches in the First World War.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.000]   When somebody called the trenches of the First World War,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.840]   the long grave already dug
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.440]   because millions of men were killed
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.200]   and the trenches never moved a foot this way,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.040]   a foot that way, all this horror.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.720]   And Dewey came up with the idea
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.960]   that if you could fly over the battlefield
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.480]   to the homeland of the enemy
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.080]   and destroy his capacity to make war,
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.680]   then the people of that country, he theorized,
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.560]   would rise up in rebellion
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.880]   and throw out their leaders and sue for peace.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.480]   And this became the dream of all the air forces
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   of the world, but particularly ours.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   Until around 1943, it was called the U.S. Army Air Force.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.760]   And the dream of every guy in the Air Force,
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.960]   every officer, was to get out from under the army,
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.720]   not just be something that delivers ground support
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.800]   or air support to the army as it advances,
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   but a power that could actually win wars.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.520]   And the missing piece had always been
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.960]   the scale of the weaponry they carried.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.280]   So when the bomb came along,
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.320]   you can see why Curtis LeMay,
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.720]   who really ran the Strategic Air Command
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.200]   during the prime years of that force,
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.040]   was pushing for bigger and bigger bombs.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.360]   Because if a plane got shot down,
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.560]   but the one behind it had a hydrogen bomb,
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.360]   then it would be just almost as effective
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.280]   as the two planes together.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.760]   So they wanted big bombs,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.720]   and they went after Oppenheimer
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.280]   because he thought that was a terrible way to go,
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.200]   that there was really no military use
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.560]   for these huge weapons.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.680]   Furthermore, that the United States had more cities
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.040]   than Russia did, than the Soviet Union did.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.560]   And we were making ourselves a better target, basically,
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.680]   by introducing a weapon that could destroy a whole state.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.760]   I used to live in Connecticut, and I once calculated,
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.800]   I saw a map that showed the air pollution
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.760]   that blew up from New York City to Boston.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.680]   And I thought, well, now, if that was fallout,
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.080]   we'd be dead up here in green, lovely Connecticut.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:11.920]   And it would have been.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.360]   I mean, that was the scale that it was going to be
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.880]   with these big new weapons.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.760]   So on the one hand,
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.560]   you had some of the important leaders in the government
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.160]   thinking that these weapons were not
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.000]   the war-winning weapons that the Air Force wanted them
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.160]   and realized they could be.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.280]   And on the other hand,
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.200]   you had the Air Force cornering the market
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   on nuclear solutions to battles, if you will.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.680]   All because some guy in a trench in World War I
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.600]   was sufficiently horrified and sufficiently theoretical
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.480]   about what was possible with air power.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.760]   I mean, remember, they were still flying biplanes.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:57.000]   When H.G. Wells wrote his novel, "The World Set Free,"
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.320]   in 1913, predicting an atomic war
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.440]   that would lead to world government,
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   he had Air Forces delivering atomic bombs
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.760]   but he forgot to update his planes.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.120]   They were, the guys in the back seat, the bombardiers,
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.200]   were sitting in a biplane, open cockpit.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.120]   And when the pilots had dropped the bomb,
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.000]   they would reach down and pick up their H.G. Wells' idea
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.680]   of an atomic bomb and throw it over the side.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.640]   So, which is kind of what was happening
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.920]   in Washington after the war.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.320]   And it led us to a really, I think, terribly misleading
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.640]   and unfortunate perspective on how many weapons we needed,
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.800]   which in turn, fomented the arms race with the Soviets
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.400]   and just chased off.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.280]   In the Soviet Union,
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.640]   they had a practical perspective on factories.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.920]   Every factory was supposed to produce
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.560]   120% of its target every year.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.600]   That was considered good Soviet realism.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.160]   And they did that with their nuclear war weapons.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.080]   So, by the height of the Cold War,
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.120]   they had 75,000 nuclear weapons,
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.080]   which would have been,
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:16.040]   nobody had heard yet of nuclear winter.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:20.760]   So, if both sides had set off this string of mass traps
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.600]   that we had in our arsenals,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.800]   it would have been the end of the human world
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.840]   without question.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.760]   - Yeah.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.080]   You know, that actually, it raises the interesting question.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.840]   If the military planners thought
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.760]   that the conventional nuclear weapon
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.880]   was like the firebombing,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.920]   would it have been the case
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.680]   that if there wasn't a thermonuclear weapon,
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.800]   that there actually would have been a nuclear war by now?
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.920]   Because people wouldn't have been thinking of it
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.080]   as this hard red line.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.240]   - I don't think so, because, I mean,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   we're talking about one bomb and one plane
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.800]   versus 400 planes and thousands of bombs.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   That scale was clear.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.040]   I think deterrence was the more important business.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.520]   Everyone seemed to understand,
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.160]   even the spies that the Soviets had connected up to
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.000]   were wholesaling information back to the Soviet Union.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.520]   There's this comic moment
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.560]   when Truman is sitting with Joseph Stalin at Potsdam,
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.800]   and he tells Stalin, "We have a powerful new weapon."
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.680]   And that's as much as he's ready to say about it.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.840]   And Stalin looks at him and says,
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.880]   "Good, I hope you put it to good use with the Japanese."
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.480]   Stalin knows exactly what he's talking about.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.920]   He's seen the design
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.800]   of the Fat Man-type Nagasaki plutonium bomb.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.920]   He's held it in his hands
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.880]   because they had spies all over the place.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.040]   - Well, how much longer would it have taken the Soviets
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.160]   to develop the bomb if they didn't have any spies?
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.480]   - Probably not any longer.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.520]   - Really?
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.800]   - When the Soviet Union collapsed in the winter of '92,
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   I ran over there as quickly as I could get over there
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.960]   because the scientists in this limbo
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.320]   between forming a new kind of government
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.800]   and some of the countries pulling out
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.560]   and becoming independent and so forth,
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.680]   all of a sudden, their nuclear scientists,
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.360]   the ones who'd worked on their bombs, were free to talk.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.800]   And I found that out through Elena Bonner,
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.760]   Andrei Sakharov's widow,
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.720]   who was connected to people I knew.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.240]   And she said, "Yeah, come on over."
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   And her secretary, who was a geologist
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.640]   about 35 years old, Sakharov,
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.680]   became my guide around the country.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.600]   And we went to various apartments
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.000]   where retired guys from the bomb program
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   were living on, as far as I could tell,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.160]   a sack of potatoes and some salt.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.400]   They really, you know, they had government pensions
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.120]   and the money was worthless all of a sudden.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.400]   I was buying photographs from them,
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.280]   partly because I needed the photographs
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.560]   and partly because I thought, I mean,
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.840]   20 bucks was two months' income at that point.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.760]   So it was easy for me and it helped them.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.080]   And in turn, they told me about, by 1947,
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.760]   they had first-class physicists at the Soviet Union.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.880]   They do in Russia today.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:19.280]   So by 1947, they had a design for a bomb
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.360]   that they said was half the weight
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.680]   and twice the yield of the Fat Man bomb.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.920]   Fat Man bomb was the plutonium implosion, right?
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.080]   So forth.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.920]   And it weighed about, I don't know, 9,000 pounds.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.520]   So they had a much smaller
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.920]   and much more deliverable, therefore, bomb
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.360]   with a yield of about 44 kilotons.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.760]   - Why was Soviet physics so good?
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.680]   I mean, you know, you would think
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.360]   that it was like a poor society.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.440]   - The Russian mind?
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.280]   I don't know.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   You know, they learned all their technology
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.240]   from the French in the 19th century,
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.600]   which is why there are so many French words in Russian.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.600]   So they got good teachers.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.920]   The French are superb technicians.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.440]   They aren't so good at building things,
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   but they're very good at designing things.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.760]   There's something about Russia.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.400]   I don't know if it's the language or the education.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.800]   They do have good education.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:14.880]   They did.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.040]   But, I mean, I remember asking them when they were working.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.440]   I said, "On the hydrogen bomb,
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.600]   you didn't have any computers yet.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.600]   We only had really early primitive computers
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.840]   to do the complicated calculations
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.000]   of the hydrodynamics of that explosion."
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.080]   I said, "What did you do?"
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.240]   They said, "Oh, we just used nuclear."
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.320]   We just used theoretical physicists,
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.000]   which is what we did in Los Alamos.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.160]   We had guys come in who really knew their math,
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.840]   and they would sit there and work it out by hand.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.480]   And women with old Marchand calculators running numbers.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.800]   So they basically, they were just good scientists.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.920]   And they had this new design.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.560]   And Khrushchev, who ran the program,
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   took it to Lavrentiy Beria, this monster who ran the NKVD,
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.680]   who was put in charge of the program,
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.240]   and said, "Look, we can build you a better bomb.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.600]   Do you really want to waste the time
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.640]   to make that much more uranium and plutonium?"
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:18.120]   And Beria said, "Comrade, I want the American bomb.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.400]   Give me the American bomb,
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.640]   or you and all your families will be camp dust."
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.720]   He said so, and I talked to one of the leading scientists
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.880]   in the group, and he said, "So we valued our lives.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.480]   We valued our families.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.480]   We gave them a copy of the plutonium implosion bomb,"
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.800]   which it was.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.480]   - It strikes me, now that you explained this,
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.720]   that when the Soviet Union fell,
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.960]   if I was like North Korea or Iran or something,
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.400]   why didn't they, or did they, you know,
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.520]   let's send a few people to the fallen Soviet Union,
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.760]   get, recruit a few of these scientists
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.800]   to start their own program,
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.720]   buy off their stockpiles or something?
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.600]   - There was some effort by countries in the Middle East
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.160]   to get hold of the enriched uranium,
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.760]   which they wouldn't sell them.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.720]   They were, these were responsible scientists.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.960]   I mean, they told me, "Look, we worked on the bomb.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.560]   Of course you had it.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.280]   We didn't want there to be a monopoly
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.680]   on the part of any country in the world."
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.200]   So patriotically, even though Stalin
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.520]   was in charge of our country and he was a monster,
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   we still felt, even Sakharov felt that way.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.000]   He felt very much that it was his responsibility
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   to work on these things.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.120]   They all did.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:40.040]   So there was a great rush at the end of the Second World War
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.480]   to get hold of German scientists.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.640]   And about, I think, an equal number
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.920]   were grabbed by the Soviets.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.880]   All of the leading German scientists,
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.400]   like Heisenberg and Hahn and others,
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.920]   went west as fast as they could.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.400]   They didn't want to be captured by the Soviets.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.600]   But there were some who were, and they helped them work.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   You know, people have the idea that Los Alamos
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.760]   was where the bomb happened.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.160]   And it's true that in Los Alamos,
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:13.400]   we had the team that designed, developed,
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:17.200]   and built the first actual weapons.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.040]   But the truth is, the important material for weapons
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.160]   is the uranium or plutonium.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.920]   One of the scientists in the Manhattan Project
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.880]   told me years later, he said,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.720]   "You know, you can make a pretty high-level
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.240]   nuclear explosion just by taking
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.400]   two subcritical pieces of uranium,
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.800]   putting one on the floor and dropping the other by hand
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   from a height of about six feet.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.320]   If that's true, then all this business
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:51.200]   about secret designs and so forth is hogwash.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.480]   What you really need for a weapon
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.520]   is the critical mass of plutonium or uranium-235,
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.240]   or highly enriched uranium, 90% U-235.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.640]   If you've got that, there are lots of different ways
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.680]   to make the bomb.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.360]   We had two totally different ways that we used.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.800]   You know, the gun on the one hand for uranium,
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.640]   and then because plutonium was so reactive
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.280]   that if you fired up the barrel of a cannon
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.080]   at 3,000 feet per second, it would still melt down
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.720]   before the two pieces made it up.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.480]   So for that reason, they had to invent
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.160]   an entirely new technology,
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.760]   which was an amazing piece of work.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.280]   From the Soviet point of view,
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.600]   and I think this is something people don't know either,
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.920]   but it puts the Russian experience into a better context.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.040]   All the way back in the '30s,
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.520]   since the beginning of the Soviet Union
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.240]   after the First World War,
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:49.080]   they had been sending over espionage agents
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:54.080]   connected up to Americans who were willing to work for them
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:59.800]   to collect together industrial technology.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.040]   They didn't have it when they began their country.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.000]   It was very much an agricultural country.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.440]   And in that regard, you know,
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.040]   people still talk about all those damn spies
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.800]   stealing our secrets.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   We did the same thing with the British
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.000]   back in colonial days.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   We didn't know how to make a canal
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.360]   that wouldn't drain out through the soil.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.280]   The British had a certain kind of clay
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.440]   that they would line their canals with,
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.720]   and there were canals all over England in the 18th century,
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:35.800]   that was impervious to the flow of water.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   And we bought a British engineer,
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.040]   brought him over at great expense
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.240]   to teach us how to make the lining for the canals
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.800]   that opened up the Middle West and then the West.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.880]   So they were doing the same thing.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.400]   And one of those spies was a guy named Harry Gold,
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.080]   who was working all the time for them.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.720]   He gave them some of the basic technology
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.240]   of Kodak filmmaking, for example, and so forth.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:07.240]   Harry Gold was the connection between David Greenglass
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.120]   and one of the American spies at Los Alamos
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.520]   and the Soviet Union.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.440]   So it was not different.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:18.280]   So the model was never give us something
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.720]   that someone dreamed up that hasn't been tested,
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.680]   and you know works.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.880]   So it would actually be blueprints for factories,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.320]   not just a patent.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:31.560]   And therefore, when Beria, after the war,
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.480]   said give us the bomb, he meant give me the American bomb
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.040]   because we know that works.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.600]   I don't trust you guys.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.880]   Who knows what you'll do?
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.880]   You're probably too stupid anyway.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.920]   He was that kind of man.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.280]   So for all of those reasons, they built,
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.000]   the second bomb they tested was twice the yield
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.080]   and half the weight of the first bomb.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   In other words, it was their new design.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.560]   And so it was ours because the technology
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.240]   was something that we knew during the war,
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   but it was too theoretical still to use.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:09.680]   You just had to put the core and have a little air gap
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.920]   between the core and the explosives
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.280]   so that the blast wave would have a chance
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.960]   to accelerate through an open gap.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.720]   And therefore, Alvarez told me,
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.720]   he couldn't tell me what it was.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.520]   So he said, well, look,
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.240]   you can get a lot more destructive force with a hammer
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.600]   if you hit something with it,
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:33.240]   rather than if you put the head on the hammer and push.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.840]   And it took me several years
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.120]   before I figured out what he meant.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.200]   I finally understood he was talking about
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.160]   what's called levitation.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.640]   - On the topic of the fact that the major difficulty
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:50.480]   in developing a bomb is either the refinement of uranium
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.440]   into U-235 or its transmutation into plutonium.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.360]   I was actually talking to a physicist
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.640]   in preparation for this conversation.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.240]   And he explained the same thing
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.080]   that if you get two subcritical masses of uranium together,
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.240]   you wouldn't have the full bomb
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.160]   because it would start to tear itself apart
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.360]   without the tamper,
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.160]   but you would still have like more than one megaton.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.920]   - Well, it would be a few kilotons.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.320]   Alvarez's model would be a few kilotons, but that's a lot.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.400]   - Yeah, but he claimed, sorry, I meant kiloton.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.360]   He claimed that one of the reasons
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.640]   why we talk so much about Los Alamos
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.480]   is that at the time the government
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.800]   didn't want other countries to know
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.320]   that if you refine uranium, you've got it.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.160]   And so they were like,
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.760]   oh, we did all this fancy physics work in Los Alamos
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.760]   that you're not gonna get to, so don't even worry about it.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.720]   I don't know what you make of that theory.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.640]   That basically, it was like a sort of a sign-off
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.120]   to convince people that the Los Alamos was important.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   - You know, again, I think all the physics
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.720]   had been checked out by a lot of different countries by then.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.200]   It was pretty clear to everybody
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   what you needed to do to get to a bomb,
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.320]   that it was a fast fission reactor,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.440]   not a slow fission reactor, like a reactor.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.360]   They'd work that out.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.520]   So I don't think that's really the problem.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.640]   But to this day, no one ever talks about the fact
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.520]   that the real problem isn't the design of the weapon.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.480]   - Yeah.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.520]   - You could make one with wooden boxes if you wanted to.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.240]   The design, the problem is getting the material.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.120]   And that's good because it's damn hard to make that stuff.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.480]   And it's something you can protect.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.400]   - We also have gotten very lucky.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.000]   I mean, if lucky is a word you wanna use,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.920]   I think you mentioned this in the book at some point,
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   but the laws of physics could have been such
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.640]   that unrefined uranium ore was enough
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.320]   to build a nuclear weapon, right?
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.160]   - Yeah.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:47.980]   - In some sense, we got lucky
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.840]   that it takes a nation-state level actor
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.840]   to really refine and produce the raw substance.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.800]   - Yeah, no, I was thinking about that this morning
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.200]   on the way over.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.720]   And you know, all the uranium in the world
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.860]   would already have destroyed itself.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.700]   - Oh.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.720]   - Most people have never heard of the living reactors
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.720]   that developed on their own in a bed of uranium ore
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.920]   in Africa about 2 billion years ago.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.760]   - Yeah.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.840]   - When there was more U-235 in a mass of uranium ore
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.360]   than there is today because it decays
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.400]   like all radioactive elements.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.960]   And the French discovered it
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.580]   when they were mining the ore and found this bed
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:36.680]   that had a totally different set of nuclear characteristics.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.480]   They were like, "What happened?"
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   But there were natural reactors in Gabon once upon a time.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.240]   And they started up because some water moderator
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.800]   for them to make the neutrons slow down
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.120]   washed its way down through a bed
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.520]   of much more highly enriched uranium ore
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.280]   than we still have today.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.480]   Maybe five, 10% instead of three and a half
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.640]   or one and a half, whatever it now is.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.920]   And they ran for about 100,000 years
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.160]   and then shut themselves down
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.000]   because they had accumulated enough fission products
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.960]   that the U-235 had been used up.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.920]   Interestingly, it never migrated,
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.160]   this material never migrated out of the bed of ore.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.440]   People today who are anti-nuclear say,
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.760]   "Well, what are we gonna do about the waste?
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.800]   "Where are we gonna put all that waste?"
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.160]   It's silly, you know.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.400]   - Shove it in a hole.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.440]   - Yeah, basically.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.080]   That's exactly what we're planning to do.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.800]   Holes that are deep enough and in beds of material
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.720]   that will hold them long enough
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.160]   for everything to decay back to the Irish War.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.200]   It's not a big problem except politically
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.000]   because nobody wants it in their backyard.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.600]   - On the topic of the Soviets,
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.280]   one question I had in reading the book was,
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.720]   listen, we renegotiate with Stalin at Yalta
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.600]   and we surrender a large part of Eastern Europe to him
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.680]   under his sphere of influence.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.040]   And we know, I mean, obviously we saw, you know,
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.440]   50 years of immiseration there.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.040]   As a result, and that at the time only we had the bomb,
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.840]   would it have been possible given the fact that,
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.840]   you know, we had the bomb,
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.080]   that we could have just like knocked out the Soviet Union
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.720]   or at least prevented so much of the world
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.560]   from succumbing to communism
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.000]   in the aftermath of World War II?
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.440]   If we just kept it going, is that a possibility?
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.000]   - When we say we had the bomb,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   we had a few partly assembled, handmade bombs.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.120]   It took almost as long to assemble one
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.080]   as the battery life of the batteries
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.400]   that would drive the original charge
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.120]   that would set off the explosion.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.000]   It was kind of a big bluff.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   You know, when they closed Berlin in 1948
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.640]   and we had to supply Berlin by air
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.320]   with coal and food for a whole winter,
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.640]   we moved some B-29s to England.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.040]   The B-29 being the bomber that had carried the bombs.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.720]   They were not outfitted for nuclear weapons.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.040]   They didn't have the same kind of bomb-based structure.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.480]   The weapons that were dropped in Japan
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.960]   had a single hook that held the entire bomb.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.800]   So when the bay opened and the hook was released,
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.080]   the thing dropped.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.720]   And that's very different from dropping whole rows
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.680]   of you've seen the photographs
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.000]   and the film footage of small bombs.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.960]   So it was a big bluff on our part.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.160]   We took some time after the war,
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.560]   inevitably, to pull everything together.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.520]   There was a brand new technology.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.440]   There was a brand new weapon.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.400]   Who was gonna be in charge of it?
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.960]   There was a battle between the military wanted control.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.840]   Truman wasn't about to give the military control.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.560]   He'd been an artillery officer in the First World War.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.080]   He used to say, "No damn artillery officer captain
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.120]   "is gonna start World War III when I'm president."
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:08.840]   So I grew up in the same town he lived in.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.680]   I know his accent.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.600]   - You live in Missouri?
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600]   - Independence, Missouri, yeah.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.000]   Used to see him at his front steps
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.880]   taking pictures with tourists after he,
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.640]   well, he was still president actually.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.720]   So he used to step out on the porch
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.240]   and let the tourists take photographs.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.480]   About a half a block from my Methodist church
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.960]   where I went to church.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.160]   So it was interesting.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.720]   Interestingly, his wife was considered
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.440]   much more socially acceptable than he was.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.640]   She was from old family, Independence, Missouri people,
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.480]   and he was some farmer from way out in Grandview, Missouri,
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.880]   south of Kansas City.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.920]   Values.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.240]   Anyway, at the end of the war,
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.880]   there was a great rush from the Soviet side
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.840]   of what was already a zone, right?
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.160]   There was a Soviet zone, a French zone,
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.040]   British zone, and American zone.
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.520]   Germany was divided up into those zones
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.240]   to grab what's left of the uranium ore
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.640]   that the Germans had stockpiled.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.240]   And there was evidence that there were several,
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.560]   a number of barrels of the stuff in a warehouse
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.720]   somewhere in the middle of all of this.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.360]   And there's a very funny story about the Russians ran in
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.360]   and grabbed off one site full of uranium ore,
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.080]   this yellow black stuff
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.440]   in what were basically wine barrels.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.480]   And we, at the same night,
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.200]   just before the wall came down, as it were,
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.600]   between the zones,
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.240]   were running in from the other side,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.640]   grabbing some other ore and taking it back to our side.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.200]   But there was also a good deal of requisitioning
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.560]   of German scientists.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.640]   And the ones who had gotten away early came west,
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.400]   but there were others who didn't
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.920]   and ended up helping the Soviets.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.640]   And they were told, look, you help us build the bomb,
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.320]   you help us, actually, you help us build the reactors
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.360]   and the uranium separation systems that we need,
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.920]   and we'll let you go home and back to your family,
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.480]   which they did.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.200]   Early '50s by then, the German scientists
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.120]   who had helped the Russians went home.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.040]   And I think our people stayed here
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.520]   and brought their families over, I don't know.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.000]   - Was there an opportunity after the end of World War II
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.200]   for the US, before the Soviets developed the bomb,
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.160]   for the US to do something
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   where either it somehow enforced a monopoly
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.880]   on having the bomb,
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.640]   or if that wasn't possible,
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.120]   make some sort of credible gesture
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.200]   that we're eliminating this technology,
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.000]   you guys don't work on this,
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.760]   we're all just gonna step back from this?
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.160]   - We tried both.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.880]   Before the war ended, General Groves,
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.440]   who had the mistaken impression
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.000]   that there was a limited amount
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.760]   of high-grade uranium ore in the world,
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:07.520]   put together a company that tried to corner the market
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.280]   on all the available supply.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.360]   For some reason, he didn't realize
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.600]   that a country the size of the Soviet Union
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.360]   is going to have some uranium ore somewhere.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.880]   And, of course, it did in Kazakhstan.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.040]   Rich uranium ore,
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.200]   enough for all the bombs they wanted to build.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.400]   But he didn't know that,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.240]   and I frankly don't know why he didn't know that,
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.040]   but I guess uranium's use before the Second World War
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.480]   was basically as a glazing agent for pottery,
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.040]   all that famous yellow pottery and orange pottery
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.720]   that people owned in the 1930s.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.640]   Those colors came from uranium,
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.400]   and they're sufficiently radioactive, even to this day,
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.800]   that if you wave a Geiger counter over them,
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.760]   you get some clicks.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.320]   In fact, there have been places
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.560]   where they've gone in with masks and suits on
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.360]   and grabbed the Mexican pottery
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.880]   and taken it out in a lead-lined case.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.640]   People have been so worried about it.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.000]   But that was the only use, really, for uranium,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.440]   and to make a particular kind of glass.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.760]   So once it became clear
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.000]   that there was another use for uranium,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.600]   a much more important one,
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.400]   Groves typed corn to the world market,
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.960]   and he thought he had.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.200]   So that was one effort to limit
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.720]   what the Soviet Union could do.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   Another was to negotiate some kind of agreement
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.320]   between the parties.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.920]   That was something that really never got off the ground,
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.360]   because Truman, Secretary of State,
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.880]   was an old Southern politician.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.800]   He didn't trust the Soviets.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.520]   He went to the first meeting.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.440]   Where was it?
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.480]   Geneva, I think, in '45, after the war was over,
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.120]   and kind of strutted around and said,
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.080]   "Well, I got the bomb in my pocket,
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.040]   "so let's sit down and talk here."
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.640]   And the Soviets basically said, "Screw you.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.160]   "We don't care.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.520]   "We're not worried about your bomb.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.720]   "Go home."
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.280]   So that didn't work.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.880]   Then there was the effort to get the United Nations
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.760]   to start to develop some program of international control.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.760]   And the program was proposed originally by a committee
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.520]   put together by our State Department
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.760]   that included Robert Oppenheimer.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.840]   Rightly so, because the other members of the committee
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.840]   were industrialists, engineers, government officials,
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.480]   people with various kinds of expertise
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.880]   around the very complicated problems of technology
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.560]   and the science, and of course, the politics, the diplomacy.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.320]   Oppenheimer taught them, in a couple of weeks,
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.720]   taught them the basics of the nuclear physics involved,
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.800]   and taught them what he knew about bomb design,
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.400]   which was everything, actually,
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.240]   since he'd run Los Alamos during the war.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.360]   And they came up with a plan,
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.800]   and people have scoffed ever since
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.680]   at what came to be called the Atchison-Lilienthal Plan,
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.360]   named after the State Department people.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.800]   But it's the only plan I think anyone has ever devised
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.400]   that makes real sense as to how you could have
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.560]   international control without a world government.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:29.520]   Basically, every country would be open to inspection
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.360]   by any agency that was set up.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.080]   And the inspections would not be
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.240]   at the convenience of the country,
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.080]   but whenever the inspectors felt they needed to inspect.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.200]   So what Oppenheimer called an open world.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.120]   And if you had that, and then,
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.480]   if each country then developed its own nuclear industries,
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:57.480]   nuclear power, medical uses, whatever,
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.560]   then if one country tried clandestinely
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.280]   to begin to build bombs,
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.640]   you would know about it at the time of the next inspection.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.840]   And then you could try diplomacy.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.040]   If that didn't work, you could try conventional war.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.960]   If that wasn't sufficient,
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.280]   then you could start building your bombs too.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.000]   And at the end of this sequence,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.480]   which would be long enough,
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.880]   assuming that there were no bombs existent in the world,
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.160]   and the ore was stored in a warehouse somewhere,
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.920]   six months maybe, maybe a year,
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.400]   it would be time for everyone to scale up
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.360]   to deterrence with weapons
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.360]   rather than deterrence without weapons,
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.960]   with only the knowledge.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.240]   That to me is the answer to the whole thing.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.120]   And it might have worked,
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.760]   but there were two big problems.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.440]   One, no country is gonna allow a monopoly
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.240]   on a nuclear weapon, at least no major power.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.400]   So the Russians were not willing to sign on
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.240]   from the beginning.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.080]   They just couldn't.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:07.920]   How could they?
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.760]   We would not have.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:14.200]   Two, Truman assigned a kind of a loud mouth,
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   wise old Wall Street guy
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.720]   to present this program to the United Nations.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.760]   And he sat down with Oppenheimer
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.400]   after he and his people had studied
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.440]   and said, "Where's your army?
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.200]   "Somebody starts working on a bomb over there.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.760]   "You gotta go in and take that out, don't you?"
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.840]   He said, "What would happen
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.720]   "if one country started building a bomb?"
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.920]   And Oppenheimer said, "Well, that would be an act of war."
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.680]   Meaning then the other countries
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.560]   could begin to escalate as they needed to
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.160]   to protect themselves against one power,
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.760]   trying to overwhelm the rest.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.080]   Well, Baruch never, Bernard Baruch
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.040]   was the name of the man.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.520]   He didn't get it.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.200]   So when he presented his revised version
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.440]   of the Achen-Lilienthal Plan,
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.480]   which was called the Baruch Plan to the United Nations,
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.640]   he included his army.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.720]   And he insisted that the United States
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.240]   would not give up its nuclear monopoly
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.200]   until everyone else had signed on.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.800]   So of course, who's gonna sign on to that deal?
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.760]   - I feel like he has kind of point in the sense that,
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.760]   listen, World War II took five years or more.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.280]   You know, if we find that the Soviets
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.000]   are starting to develop a bomb,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.920]   it's not like within the six months or a year or whatever
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.040]   it would take them to start refining the ore.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.240]   And to the point we found out
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.040]   that they've been refining ore
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.840]   to when we start a war and engage in it
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.800]   and doing all the diplomacy.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.680]   By that point, they might already have the bomb.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.240]   And so, you know, we're behind
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.600]   because we dismantled our weapons.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.160]   We're only starting to develop our weapons
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.240]   once we've exhausted these other avenues.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.800]   - Not to develop.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.840]   Presumably we would have developed
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.800]   and everybody would have developed anyway.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   But rather to not have, I mean, I think of this,
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:16.800]   another way to think of this is as delayed delivery times.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.320]   - Yeah.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.520]   - It takes about 30 minutes to get an ICBM
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:25.440]   from central Missouri to Moscow.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.280]   That's the time window for doing anything
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.040]   other than starting a nuclear war.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.640]   So take the warhead off those missiles
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.600]   and move it down the road 10 miles.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.320]   So then it takes three hours.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.520]   You got to put the warhead back on the missiles
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.720]   if the other side is willing to do this too.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.760]   And you both can watch and see.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.920]   We require openness, a word bore introduced
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.320]   to this whole thing in order to make this happen.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.080]   You can't have secrets.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.560]   You have to absolutely have.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.720]   And of course, as time passed on,
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.040]   we developed elaborate surveillance from space,
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.920]   surveillance from planes and so forth.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.280]   It would not have worked in 1946 for sure.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.960]   There wasn't the surveillance.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.360]   But that system, by the way, is in place today.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.560]   The International Atomic Energy Agency
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.560]   has detected systems in air, in space, underwater.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.800]   They can detect 50 pounds of dynamite
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.080]   exploded in England from Australia
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.800]   with the systems that we have in place.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.160]   So we have a system in place exactly.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.760]   It's technical rather than human resources, but it's there.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.400]   So it's theoretically possible today
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.640]   to get started on such a program.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.240]   Except of course now, in like 1950,
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.160]   the world is awash in nuclear weapons.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.680]   Despite the reductions that have occurred
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.480]   since the end of the Cold War,
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.160]   there's still 30, 40,000 nuclear weapons in the world.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.080]   Way too many.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.880]   - Yeah, that's really interesting.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.240]   What percentage of warheads do you think
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.280]   are accounted for by this organization?
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.880]   Like if there's 30,000 warheads, what percentage are?
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.720]   - All.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.560]   - Really? Okay.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.400]   - North Korea doesn't have a secret.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.200]   - They're allowed to inspect anywhere
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.840]   without having to ask the government for permission.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.080]   - But presumably not like North Korea or something, right?
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.640]   - North Korea is an exception.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.800]   But we keep pretty good track of North Korea,
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.040]   needless to say.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.640]   - Are you surprised with how successful
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.160]   non-proliferation has been?
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.800]   The number of countries with nuclear weapons
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.520]   has not gone up for decades.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.520]   Given the fact, as you were talking about earlier,
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   it's simply a matter of refining or transmuting uranium.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.440]   Is it surprising that there are countries that have it?
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.280]   - That's really an interesting part.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.280]   Again, a part of the story that most people, I think,
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.520]   have never really heard.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.240]   In the '50s, before the development
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:00.240]   and signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.960]   which was, I think, 1968, and it took effect in 1970,
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.120]   a lot of countries that you would never have imagined
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.800]   were working on nuclear weapons.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.560]   Sweden, Norway, Japan, South Korea.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:21.040]   A lot of countries, they had the technology.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.200]   They just didn't have the materials.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.400]   And it was kind of dicey about what you should do.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.440]   But I interviewed some of the Swedish scientists
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.760]   who worked on their bomb.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.520]   And they said, "But look, we weren't talking about,
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.160]   "we were just talking about making some tactical nukes
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.320]   "that would slow down a Russian tank advance
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.880]   "on our country long enough for us to mount a defense."
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.080]   I said, "So why did you give it up?"
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:54.160]   They said, "Well, when the Soviets develop hydrogen bombs,
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.160]   "it would only take two to destroy Sweden,
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.320]   "so we didn't see much point."
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.640]   And we signed then the Non-Proliferation Treaty, they said.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.120]   And our knowledge, they said,
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.040]   these scientists of how to build nuclear weapons,
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.960]   helped us deal with countries like South Africa,
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:15.400]   which did build a few bombs in the late 1980s.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   Six World War II type gun bombs
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.200]   fueled with enriched uranium,
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.280]   because South Africa is awash in uranium ore
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.200]   and makes a lot of uranium for various purposes.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.040]   So efforts were starting up,
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.960]   and that's where John Kennedy got the numbers
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.400]   that in a famous speech he delivered,
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:44.400]   where he said, "I lose sleep at night
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.200]   "over the real prospect of there being 10 countries
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:53.200]   "with nuclear weapons by 1970 and 30 by 1980."
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.160]   And of course, that would have been a nightmare world
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.680]   because the risk of somebody using them
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.760]   would have gone up accordingly.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.720]   But we offered, after the Cuban Missile Crisis,
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.040]   we and the Soviet Union basically said,
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.720]   "We gotta slow this thing down,
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.440]   "for us and for others as well."
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.480]   And the treaty that was then put together and negotiated
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.960]   offered a good deal.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.760]   It said, "If you don't build nuclear weapons,
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   "we will give you the knowledge
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.320]   "to build nuclear energy technology
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.160]   "that will allow you to forge ahead
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.920]   "very successfully with that."
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.800]   And these countries had not,
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.400]   there was a belief in the early years of nuclear weapons
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.200]   that as soon as the technology was learned by a country,
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.480]   they would immediately proceed to build the bomb.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.640]   And no one really thought it through.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:51.840]   It seems sort of self-evident, but it wasn't self-evident.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.120]   There are dangers to building a nuclear weapon
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.600]   and having an arsenal.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.360]   If you're a little country and you have a nuclear arsenal,
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:01.440]   you have the potential to destroy a large country,
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.720]   or at least disable a large country,
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.240]   because you have these terribly destructive weapons,
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.080]   that makes you a target.
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:12.040]   That means that large country is gonna look at you
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.080]   and worry about you, which they never would have before.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:20.160]   That kind of logic dawned on everybody at that point,
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.120]   and they were getting a good deal.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.960]   And the other part of the deal was the part
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.680]   that the nuclear powers never kept to this day,
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:33.680]   which was an agreement that we would work seriously
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:39.680]   and vigorously toward nuclear disarmament.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.600]   We didn't do that.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.240]   We just told them we would,
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.040]   and then kind of snuck around on the sides.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.000]   So much so that by this treaty,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.840]   because no one was quite trusting of the whole deal,
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.720]   treaties are usually signed and they exist in perpetuity.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.520]   They don't have any end date.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.480]   They go on until somebody breaks the rules.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:05.480]   But this treaty was given a 25 year review period,
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.080]   which would have been 1995.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.400]   At which point, if the countries had chosen
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.320]   to abrogate the treaty, it would have been set aside
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.680]   and everybody could have gone back
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.320]   to making nuclear weapons.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.320]   Now, it almost came to that for the very reason
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.280]   that the main nuclear powers had not fulfilled
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.320]   their agreement to start reducing arsenals.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.520]   You know, we didn't start reducing our nuclear arsenal
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.000]   till the end of the Cold War,
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.920]   till the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.760]   That's when we began cutting back,
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.080]   as did the former Soviet Union.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.640]   A diplomat who's a friend of mine, Tom Graham,
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.520]   was assigned the task by our State Department
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.480]   of going around to the countries
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.240]   that were going to be voting on this renewal
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.120]   or not of the treaty and convincing their leaderships
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.600]   around the world that it wasn't in their best interest
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.040]   to abrogate the treaty at that point.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.320]   Tom spent two years on the road.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.160]   The only place he thought he should go
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.000]   is not the UN, where there's a second level diplomat
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.360]   he could have talked to, but back to the home countries.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.200]   And he convinced enough countries around the world.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.400]   I mean, he's another hero.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.720]   He's never been properly celebrated.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.280]   He convinced enough countries around the world
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.560]   that they did agree to extend the treaty in perpetuity
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.400]   with the proviso that the goddamn nine nuclear powers
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.680]   get busy eliminating their nukes.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.960]   And of course, George H.W. Bush, bless him,
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.000]   I didn't like his politics otherwise,
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.320]   but he stepped forward and split the nuclear arsenal
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.040]   in half right away.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:46.880]   We dropped our numbers way, way lower than we had been.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.520]   He pulled them out of South Korea,
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.520]   which was a great bugaboo for both the Soviets
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.080]   and the North Koreans and China,
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.240]   and did a lot of good work toward moving
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:00.080]   toward a real reduction in nuclear arsons.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.160]   And the Russians agreed at that time.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.600]   It was before Putin took power.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.600]   So there was a change for the better,
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.520]   but there are still too many around, unfortunately.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.360]   So that's why there are only nine nuclear powers
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.800]   to this day.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.200]   - How worried are you about a proxy war
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.200]   between great powers turning nuclear?
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.520]   For example, people have been worried
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.320]   about the Ukraine conflict for this reason.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:31.000]   In the future, if we're facing an invasion of Taiwan
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.520]   by China, that's another thing to worry about.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.200]   I had a friend who understands these things really well,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.440]   and we were arguing, 'cause I thought,
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.280]   listen, if there's a risk of nuclear war,
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.400]   let them take Taiwan.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.040]   We'll build semiconductor factories in Arkansas.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.160]   Who cares, right?
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.920]   And he explains, no, you don't understand,
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:53.400]   because if we don't protect Taiwan,
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.000]   then Japan and South Korea decide to go nuclear
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.840]   'cause they're like, America won't protect us.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.680]   And if they go nuclear,
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.120]   then the risk of nuclear actually goes up, not down.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.600]   - Or they just decide to align with China
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.560]   because we didn't protect them with our nuclear umbrella
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.800]   the way we promised we would.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.640]   - Right, well, I guess we haven't promised Taiwan that,
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.640]   but it's implied, I guess.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.720]   - I think it's implied.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.480]   If we said we're gonna help defend them,
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.440]   that's what that means.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.600]   - But anyway, so the question was,
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.600]   how worried are you about proxy wars turning in nuclear?
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.880]   - I think the best evidence,
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.280]   and there's been a lot of argument
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.200]   about whether nuclear deterrence actually works or not.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.520]   The best evidence is that the United States
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.760]   fought a number of wars on the periphery,
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.400]   beginning with Korea and then Vietnam and so forth,
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.600]   and some other smaller things in between,
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   where we were willing to accept defeat.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.560]   We accepted defeat in Vietnam for sure,
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.120]   rather than use our nuclear arsenal,
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.400]   always because behind those peripheral countries,
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.480]   if you will, was a major nuclear power,
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.160]   China, Soviet Union, whatever.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.160]   And we didn't wanna risk a nuclear war.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.120]   So at that level,
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.000]   deterrence really seemed to work for a long time.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.360]   But there's been a change lately,
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.800]   and it's kind of terrifying, I find it at least.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.440]   And the first manifestation was when India and Pakistan,
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.440]   which both went nuclear full-scale in the late 1990s.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.880]   India had tested one bomb in 1974,
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.720]   which they claimed was a peaceful explosion,
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.280]   whatever that is.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.360]   But they hadn't proceeded anywhere from there.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.000]   And Pakistan had not tested,
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.200]   well, they tested their first bomb in China
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.320]   when they got it from A.Q. Khan,
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:53.720]   the same guy who was trying to proliferate to Iran
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.080]   a little later and Iraq.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.960]   But they didn't build a lot of warheads either.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.000]   And then their conflict or the personalities involved
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.560]   in the governments got sideways with each other.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.920]   And both sides tested a quick flurry
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.920]   of four or five bombs each around 1997 or eight, I think.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.880]   So there they were.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.040]   Now they were full-fledged nuclear powers
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.440]   on the scale of two regional countries.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.320]   But then in 1999,
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.280]   there was a border conflict between the two countries.
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.160]   And Pakistan came up with a whole new argument
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.720]   about nuclear deterrence.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:39.560]   Not only could you prevent a nuclear escalation,
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.240]   but if you kept your deterrent in place,
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.800]   you could have a conventional war
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:51.920]   with the other side not willing to escalate to nuclear
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.440]   because you still had your nuclear arsenal.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.080]   And that, which came very close to a nuclear exchange,
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.920]   we jumped in with both feet, believe me,
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.120]   and we're all over both countries about, don't do this.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.800]   Don't go this far.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.040]   And they backed off.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.000]   But Putin or someone in the Russian complex
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.760]   picked up on that new approach.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.320]   And it's the one Putin is using now.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.840]   He's basically saying, I'm having a conventional war here.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.600]   And don't you dare introduce nuclear weapons or I will.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.160]   In fact, if you defeat me, I may introduce nuclear weapons.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.800]   Screw you.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.800]   I'm gonna use my nukes as a backup.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.680]   That's new and it's terrifying
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.560]   because it's a totally different kind of deterrence
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.160]   that risks going too far too fast
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.600]   to be able to know what's going on.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:50.000]   - And in some sense, he is calling our bluff in that,
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   or at least I hope he is, because I hope the government,
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.400]   I mean, obviously you shouldn't say this,
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.640]   but hopefully the government would not respond
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.360]   to a tactical nuke used in Ukraine
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.920]   by getting the US annihilated.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.760]   - I don't think we would respond
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.560]   with a full-scale nuclear attack.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.000]   But I do think we would respond
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   with some level of possibly nuclear exchange with Russia.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.520]   And I think, or maybe just with that part of Russia,
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.520]   I don't know.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.360]   We've long had a policy called decapitation.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.440]   We long ago targeted the individual apartments
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.840]   and dachas of this Russian leadership
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.920]   with individual warheads.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.960]   I mean, in the window at high noon,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.560]   because they were very accurate now.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.960]   And they're totally stealthy
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.560]   if you're thinking about cruise missiles.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.480]   We can put one in someone's window
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.560]   and it's a nuclear warhead and not just a high explosive.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.440]   So they've known that for a long time.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.680]   That doesn't give anybody time to get into the bomb shelter.
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.840]   I mean, this has gotten really very hairy.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.880]   Used to be pretty straightforward.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.640]   Don't bomb us, we'll bomb you.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:10.600]   Attack in some peripheral country
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:14.280]   and we won't bomb you because you might bomb us.
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:15.680]   We'll lose that little war,
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.720]   but we'll come in somewhere else.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.840]   All of these things, that's complicated enough.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.200]   But now we're talking about this other level.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.520]   - So in some sense,
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:29.520]   this idea that we can backstop a conventional power with,
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.880]   you know, the Soviets had millions of men in the army
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.800]   after World War II stationed in Eastern Europe.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.400]   What was it like 2 million people
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.720]   in the Red Army or something?
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.200]   And we said, we didn't have the troops remaining
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.240]   in Western Europe, but we said, listen,
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.440]   if you invade Western Europe,
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.200]   we'll respond with a nuclear attack.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.800]   And so, I mean, I guess that worked.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:55.240]   - That worked until August, 1949,
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:58.480]   when the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.080]   And that's when panic hit Washington.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.800]   And the whole debate went on about,
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.040]   do we build hydrogen bombs?
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.080]   And ultimately the military prevailed
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.880]   and Truman signed on and plus Fuchs was outed.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.520]   And there was this whole knowledge
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.520]   that the Russians knew a lot
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.280]   'cause Fuchs knew our early work on hydrogen weapons
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.480]   before the end of the war.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:22.480]   We were exploring the possibility.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.320]   All of that came together to,
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:28.400]   with a kind of a terrible moment
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.680]   when the Teller side prevailed
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.120]   and we said, let's build bigger bombs,
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.760]   as if that would somehow.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.800]   But there had been a balance of forces, you're quite right.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.960]   They had 2 million men on the ground in Europe,
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:42.600]   we had the bomb.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.960]   And then the balance of force was disrupted
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.320]   when they got the bomb.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.960]   So then how do we rebalance?
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.360]   And the rebalance was the hydrogen bomb.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:55.360]   But that's how you get to Armageddon ultimately,
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.640]   unfortunately.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.680]   - You talked to, I was reading the acknowledgements
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.800]   and you talked to Teller in writing the book,
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.640]   is that right?
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:03.480]   - I did.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.000]   - And obviously he was a big inspiration
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.200]   for the US pursuing the hydrogen bomb.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.640]   What was his feelings when you talked to him about this?
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.840]   - I made the mistake of going to see Teller
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.840]   at his house on the grounds of Stanford University.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:21.400]   Early on in my research when I really didn't,
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.000]   didn't have as clear a grasp of who everyone was
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.840]   and what I should ask and so forth.
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.800]   And I sent him a copy of a essay I'd written
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.760]   about Robert Oppenheimer for a magazine.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.960]   And that set him off.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:41.960]   He had reached the point where he was telling TV interviewers
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.640]   asking them how much time he would actually be on the air.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.560]   And if they said three minutes or whatever,
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.680]   he would say, all right,
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.400]   then I will answer three questions, no more.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:58.720]   Trying to control because he was convinced
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.680]   that everyone was cutting the story to make him look bad.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.120]   He really had quite a lot of paranoia
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.600]   at that point in his life.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.920]   So when he read my essay on Oppenheimer,
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.880]   he used that as the basis for basically shouting at me,
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.280]   waving my big, heavy book,
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.680]   one of my big, heavy books at him.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.240]   I remember thinking, oh my God,
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.400]   he's gonna hit me with my book.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.840]   Then I thought, wait a minute, this guy's 80 years old,
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.680]   I can take him.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.680]   But he finally said, all right,
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.040]   I will answer three questions.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.080]   And we sat down and I asked him one
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.200]   and he didn't give me an interesting answer.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.960]   Asked him the second question
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.880]   and it was worth the whole interview.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.800]   I said, was Robert Oppenheimer a good lab director?
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.600]   And I thought, well,
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.640]   here's a chance where he'll slash him.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.560]   But Oppenheimer's worst enemy said to me,
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.560]   Robert Oppenheimer was the best lab director I ever knew.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.160]   And I thought, bingo.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.160]   And then he chased me out of the house.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.320]   And I went up the road to a friend's house
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.920]   and got very drunk 'cause I was really shaken.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.440]   It was so new to me, all of this.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.760]   But that quote was worth the whole thing
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.280]   because Eisenhower in one of his memoirs says,
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.240]   I always liked Hannibal best of all the classical figures
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.520]   in the military of the Roman Empire
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:25.280]   because he comes down to us
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.000]   only in the written memoirs of his enemies.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.920]   And if they thought he was such a good leader,
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.680]   he must've been a hell of a leader.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.560]   - You know, it's interesting the way
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.120]   the Manhattan Project is organized
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.800]   because if you think of a startup in Silicon Valley,
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.080]   you have a technical founder usually
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.560]   and a non-technical founder,
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.640]   where the non-technical founder is in charge of talking
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.960]   to investors and customers and so on.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.360]   And the technical founder is in charge
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.360]   of organizing the technology and the engineers.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.200]   And in Oppenheimer, you had the guy
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.440]   who understood all the chemistry, the metallurgy,
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.040]   obviously the nuclear physics.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.400]   And then Groves is getting appropriations.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.320]   And it's an insular organization that you see it.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.600]   But okay, so why was Oppenheimer such a great lab director?
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.600]   - Oppenheimer was a man with a very divided self
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.880]   and an insecure self.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.640]   One of his closest friends, I.I. Rabi,
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.800]   who was a really profound and interesting human being.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.480]   I'm gonna be writing about him in my next book.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.240]   And I spent some time with Rabi just before he died.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.400]   But Rabi said once of Oppenheimer,
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.240]   "I always felt as if he could never decide
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.440]   whether he wanted to be president
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.840]   of the Knights of Columbus or B'nai B'rith."
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:53.680]   He said he was a certain kind of American Jew who,
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:56.880]   I mean, the German Jews who came over before
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.960]   and after the First World War were westernized.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.720]   They were not from the shuttles of the Pale of Settlement
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.920]   of the Eastern European Jews.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.440]   They were sophisticated.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.720]   They were well-educated.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.160]   They were a totally different group.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.160]   And as such, were able to assimilate fairly easily.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.480]   Oppenheimer wasn't sent to a Jewish school.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:27.240]   He was sent to the famous school that was opened in New York.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.360]   There was the Ethical Culture School, it was called.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:34.880]   And it was based on the idea of an ethical moral education,
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.880]   but not a religious education.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.400]   So they found this niche for him, his parents did.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.440]   He never quite pulled himself together as a human being.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.440]   And as is true with many people
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.600]   with that kind of personality structure,
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.680]   he was a superb actor.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:53.480]   He could play lots of different roles and he did.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:54.680]   Women adored him.
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:58.880]   He was one of the most lavish quarters of women.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.720]   He would bring a bouquet of flowers to their first date,
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.520]   which was apparently shocking to people in those days.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.480]   He was just a lovely courtly man.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.480]   But in the classroom, if somebody made a stupid mistake,
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:17.040]   he would just chew them out.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.040]   And he taught a course in physics that was so advanced
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:25.280]   that most of the best students took it twice
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.760]   'cause they couldn't store it all the first time.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.360]   And he was nasty to people all the time
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.640]   in a way that bothered a lot of people.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:39.440]   Louis Alvarez, who was someone I got to know pretty well
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.760]   because I helped him write his memoirs,
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.160]   and one of the important scientists at Los Alamos,
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.240]   really didn't get along with Oppenheimer at all
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.160]   because Oppenheimer was so condescending to everyone.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.680]   And Louis was kind of a hothead
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.240]   and he didn't like people condescending to him.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.880]   Oppenheimer never won a Nobel, Louis did, and so forth.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:00.840]   So there was this layer of Oppenheimer
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.400]   being waspish all the time, which was his insecurity.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.800]   And his insecurity extended to physics
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.500]   in that rather than dig deep into one problem,
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:16.760]   Robbie said later he just, he didn't have the zits flesh.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.320]   He couldn't sit down and focus on one problem
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.600]   because he always wanted to be someone
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.400]   who always knew everything that was going on in physics.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.040]   Well, you could call that someone
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.080]   who was a very sophisticated, knowledgeable scientist,
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.480]   or you call him someone who was superficial,
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.040]   and he was superficial.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:41.240]   He knew broadly rather than deeply, if you will.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.960]   Even though he did work, he and his graduate student
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:47.520]   of his developed the basic idea of the black hole
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.140]   long before it came up after the war.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.880]   They published a paper on what was essentially
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.640]   the physics of a black hole in 1929,
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.640]   but it wasn't called a black hole yet.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.120]   John Wheeler invented that term many years later,
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:05.400]   but the idea that a big enough sun, if it collapsed,
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.720]   would just keep on collapsing until nothing could be,
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:11.480]   could come out of it, including light,
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.360]   came from Oppenheimer, and if the black hole
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:18.500]   had been discovered out in space before he died,
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:22.480]   he certainly would have had a Nobel for the theory.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.040]   That being said, he still was someone
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.700]   who was broad rather than deep,
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:31.520]   and he was someone who was really good at playing roles.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:36.520]   So when General Groves, who himself had two or three degrees
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:40.800]   from MIT in engineering, he was no slouch,
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.340]   but his was more the industrial side of everything.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:45.560]   How do you build a factory
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.880]   when you don't know what you're gonna put in it?
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.300]   He built the factories at Oak Ridge, Tennessee,
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:54.300]   to enrich uranium and start building the early piles
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:59.400]   that would later lead to the big reactors in Washington,
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.000]   before they even knew what was gonna go in the factory.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.260]   He got orders of magnitude numbers.
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:07.120]   He said, "Start laying the concrete.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.200]   "We want it this big.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.660]   "We want this attached to it.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:12.520]   "We're gonna need power, gonna need water,
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.780]   "gonna need gas," whatever they needed.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:18.460]   I mean, he was that kind of really great engineer,
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:21.400]   but he needed someone to help explain the physics to him,
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.280]   and he saw pretty quickly at the meetings
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.720]   he was holding at the University of Chicago,
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.080]   where they were building the first reactor, little one,
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.880]   that Oppenheimer was really good at explaining things.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.560]   So he grabbed him, and Groves spent the war
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.280]   riding in trains back and forth
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.920]   among all these various sites.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.560]   He'd have the advisors from one site, like Chicago,
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.920]   jump on the train while he was taking the train
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.760]   from Chicago to Santa Fe.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.400]   Then they'd get off and take the next train back to Chicago.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.400]   Then he'd pick up the guys who were gonna go with him
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.280]   to Tennessee from Santa Fe, and they'd ride with him
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.020]   and round and round and round.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:02.440]   That's how Groves, he got a plane later in the war,
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.000]   but most of the war, he just had people riding with him.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.360]   And Oppenheimer said later,
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.520]   "Well, I became his idiot savant."
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:13.360]   And Oppenheimer did.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.560]   He explained all the physics to Groves
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.320]   because Groves had a little insecure
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.080]   around six Nobel laureates around the table
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.860]   and would say things like, "Well, you each have a PhD,
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:26.480]   "but I think my work at MIT probably was the equivalent
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.200]   "of about six PhDs, wouldn't you think?"
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.520]   And they would think, "Who is this guy?"
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.360]   - Was he joking?
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.520]   Was that sarcasm, or?
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.560]   - No, he did.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.560]   He had multiple degrees from how the military works
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.400]   when there's no war.
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.960]   They send their guys to school to get them better trained.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.640]   So when the time came to find someone to run,
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:51.000]   Oppenheimer had been pushing for a separate place
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.840]   where the scientists could get together
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.440]   and do what scientists must do
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.720]   if they're going to advance their science,
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.840]   and that is talk to each other.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.760]   The system that Groves had installed around the country
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.120]   at all these factories and so forth
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.680]   was called compartmentalization for secrecy.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.000]   And basically it was, you're only allowed to know
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.560]   just enough to do your job
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:19.560]   and not the overall picture of what your job might be for.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.840]   So for example, there were women at Oak Ridge
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.080]   running big magnetic machines
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.080]   that would separate uranium-235 from uranium-238
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:35.720]   with magnetic coils of various kinds,
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.800]   taking advantage of the very slight difference in mass
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.960]   between these two otherwise identical materials.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.840]   The ladies, the women who were doing this work
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.760]   were sat in front of a board with a big dial on it,
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.760]   a big arrow that went from zero to 10 or whatever,
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:55.320]   and told, "Keep the arrow about between right here on this."
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.080]   They didn't know what they were making,
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.560]   but they really got good at spinning their dials
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.320]   and maintaining what was basically the level
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:07.800]   of whatever electric process was going on in this machine.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.600]   So compartmentalization worked,
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:12.640]   but Oppenheimer said,
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:15.440]   "If we are compartmentalized as scientists,
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.120]   "we're not gonna get anywhere.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.640]   "Science works by gift exchange.
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.600]   "I discover something, I publish the results,
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.280]   "all the other scientists in my field can read it
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.440]   "or be told of it at a meeting,
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:29.680]   "and then they can take that information
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.080]   "and use that to move a little farther."
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.360]   And that's the way it's always been done,
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.720]   and that's the only way it works.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.400]   As soon as you lock people up
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.760]   and tell them they can't talk to each other, it stops,
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.760]   'cause the discovery over here
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.640]   doesn't get applied to a need over here.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.680]   Simple.
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:52.320]   Groves reluctantly agreed to let Oppenheimer,
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:56.240]   to let this place have openness, as it was called.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:59.880]   You see the parallel with the open world about the bomb,
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.280]   same sort of thing.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.080]   How can you know what's going on
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:05.360]   if you can't let people talk to each other,
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.560]   see what they're doing?
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:09.560]   But he insisted that the whole crew
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.240]   be put behind barbed wire in a faraway place
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:15.440]   where no one else was around.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.400]   By then, Groves had worked with Oppenheimer enough.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.680]   Oppenheimer was now playing the lab director,
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.160]   and he was superb at it,
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.400]   as Teller's remark about a good lab director
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.120]   would let you know.
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:31.360]   And for the period of the war, Hans Bethe told me this.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.320]   He said, "Before the war, Robert really could be cruel.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.240]   He would pounce on a mistake you made."
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:41.400]   And Bethe, Nobel Laureate of,
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:45.920]   Bethe discovered what makes the sun work.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:49.960]   That's how important Bethe's work was and how significant.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:53.240]   Bethe told me, and of course, everyone makes mistakes.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:54.200]   I made mistakes.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.320]   Oppenheimer would charge me with a mistake
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.040]   if I spoke wrong.
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.800]   But he said, "Before the war, after the war,
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.480]   but not during the war."
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.080]   During the war, he was the superb,
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:09.520]   kind of wise lab director,
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.920]   because unlike most scientists,
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.720]   he was not only a physicist of high class,
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.920]   but he really was psychologically astute as a human being,
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.080]   as I think insecure people often are,
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.760]   because gotta scope out what's going on.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.480]   He, you know, Oppenheimer wrote pretty good poetry.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.240]   He was interested in art.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:36.880]   He wanted to read the Bhagavad Gita
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.640]   in the original Sanskrit, so he learned Sanskrit.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.800]   He was very smart, needless to say, and a very high IQ.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.440]   Not all the physicists who did first-class work
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.160]   did have high IQs.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.080]   It took some other qualities as well.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.080]   It took the zitz flies, sitting down in a chair
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:58.240]   and focusing on one thing until you got through to it.
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.160]   That's what Rabi said, and he said,
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.840]   "That's why Oppenheimer never won a Nobel Prize."
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:08.360]   So all in all, Oppenheimer became in this place
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.840]   that some of these people later were calling
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.840]   like Mount Olympus.
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.760]   We remember, they were working on a bomb
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.880]   that was going to kill hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.880]   But it was the most curious collection of people
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.360]   who had felt like theirs was a spiritual field
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.040]   before the war.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.360]   And here they were in the war,
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.040]   and they began to think,
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.440]   well, maybe this isn't so spiritual.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.720]   Maybe we're doing something truly horrendous.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:40.680]   When Bohr comes along and says, wait a minute,
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:44.840]   even Oppenheimer by then was kind of a student of Bohr's.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:47.800]   Oppenheimer had the job of recruiting everyone
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.160]   for Los Alamos without telling them
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.640]   what they would be doing because it was secret.
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:56.760]   So he would go to a university campus
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.160]   where there was a young physicist he wanted to recruit,
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.720]   and they would go out for a walk
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:04.200]   to get away from any hidden microphones,
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.760]   and Oppenheimer would say,
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.560]   I can't tell you what we're going to be doing.
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.040]   I can tell you that it will certainly end this war,
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.000]   and it may end all war.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.720]   And that was quite enough.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:20.080]   I mean, most of them figured out
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:21.200]   what they'd be doing anyway,
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.640]   because it was sort of obvious
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.800]   when you start looking at the list of people
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.640]   who are going there.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.200]   They're all nuclear physicists.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:32.200]   So Oppenheimer and Bohr brought up together,
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.720]   brought this idea to Los Alamos and later to the world
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:42.000]   that there was a paradox, you could call it.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.320]   So the bomb had two sides,
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.960]   and they were, in a sense, a complementary
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:49.800]   because although it's certainly true
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.120]   that this was going to be a very destructive weapon,
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:56.400]   it would also maybe be true if all worked out,
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.640]   and they tried to make it work out,
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.760]   that it would put an end at least to large-scale war.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:05.400]   If you go to the numbers
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:08.160]   and graph the number of deaths from war,
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:11.720]   man-made deaths, starting in the 18th century,
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:15.600]   it's almost exponential up to 1943
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.640]   when 15 million people died
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.240]   between the war itself and the Holocaust.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:22.840]   And then it starts to decline
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.800]   as the war begins to come to an end, the wars, really.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.240]   In 1945, it drops down to about one to two million deaths,
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.240]   and it stays there ever after.
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.040]   And although one to two million deaths a year from war
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.280]   is nothing to be proud of,
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:43.800]   we lose six to seven million people in the world
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:46.360]   every year from smoking.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.320]   So in a curious way,
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:54.640]   the introduction of how to control nuclear energy
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:58.560]   changed the nature of nation-states
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:01.760]   such that they could no longer, at the limit,
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:06.280]   defend their borders with war.
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:07.800]   They had to find some other way.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.680]   At least when the scale goes up,
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:11.720]   they had to find another way.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.240]   I think that's very important
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:18.240]   because people somehow don't really understand
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:21.760]   what a millennial change
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:24.520]   the introduction of the release of nuclear energy
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.280]   into the world really was.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:28.480]   You know, as we've been talking,
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.240]   I've been thinking over and over again
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.040]   about your question about AI
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.320]   and the whole larger, interesting question
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:40.000]   that you can see how it fits into the bomb story
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.600]   of unintended consequences.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.320]   All the countries that worked on the bomb
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.480]   at some level were thinking,
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.840]   "Oh my God, we're gonna have a weapon
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:50.840]   that will surpass them all.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.880]   One ring to bind them all."
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.120]   I mean, it's like, you know,
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.800]   "Lord of the Rings," this thing.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.360]   They thought it would grandize national power,
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:04.480]   but what it did was put a limit to national power.
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.720]   For the first time in the history of the world,
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.960]   war became something that was historical
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:13.120]   rather than universal.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.440]   It was something that would no longer be possible.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.680]   And who did that?
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:20.160]   Scientists going about their quiet work
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.800]   of talking to each other
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:24.040]   and exploring the way the universe works.
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:27.360]   Bohr, who's one of my favorite people in the world,
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.160]   Bohr liked to say, you know,
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:31.800]   "Science is not about power over nature,"
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:33.880]   as people seem to think.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:38.720]   Science is about the gradual removal of prejudice.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.840]   And by that, he meant when Galileo and Copernicus
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:48.320]   changed the way everyone looked
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:51.800]   at the position of the earth in the universe,
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:54.000]   not the center of the universe anymore,
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000]   but just a planet revolving around a third-rate star,
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.760]   it changed the way everyone thought about the whole world.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:06.040]   When Darwin, I mean, we're still having a debate
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:08.280]   about Darwin in the world.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:12.880]   When Darwin definitively identified our place
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:17.880]   in the natural world as, if you will, a brainy ape,
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:21.160]   it's still taking time for a lot of people
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.320]   to swallow that one.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.880]   But inch by inch, these prejudices
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.960]   about where we are in the world and how powerful we are
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:31.240]   and what our purpose is and so forth
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:34.440]   are being drained away by science.
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:38.600]   And the science of nuclear fission and nuclear energy
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.440]   is draining away and has drained away.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.920]   The theory that we are sort of universally capable
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:49.280]   of destroying each other and getting away with it.
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:53.480]   But this is the unintended consequence.
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:57.920]   The dark side is it's only by having
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:00.640]   ademically soared over our heads
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:03.120]   the potential for world destruction,
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:05.440]   or at least of the human world,
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.000]   that it's possible to limit war in this way.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.880]   That's the threat.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.240]   And when people start saying,
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.080]   "Well, look, we can have a conventional war
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.040]   "if we've got nuclear weapons
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.960]   "because you're not gonna attack us.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.400]   "You don't dare.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.760]   "We'll use our nuclear weapons on you."
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.760]   Something's changed most recently in all of this.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:30.440]   It's outside the range of all the books I've written.
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:33.360]   It's a whole new thing and it's...
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.720]   I guess you have to work through all the combinations
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:39.080]   just as evolution does before you come up with the one
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:42.200]   that actually fits the reality of the world.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.480]   - There's like at least 10 different things.
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:46.480]   I'm trying to think which branch of the tree
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:47.720]   I wanna explore first.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.800]   On the AI question, I mean, yeah,
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:52.680]   I'm trying not to like too explicitly connect the dots
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.240]   because there is always a danger of...
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.760]   I don't know, every time I read something in history,
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:59.000]   I'm like, "Oh, this is exactly like so-and-so."
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.040]   But well, first of all, the broader outline
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.280]   of the super collective group of people
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.840]   who are engaged in this sort of historical pursuit,
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:07.960]   they understand it's a historical pursuit.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.600]   They like kind of see the inklings of it.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.640]   And one of the people, my second to last guest
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:17.640]   was Ilya Sutskever, who is the chief scientist at OpenAI,
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:20.480]   which is the big lab building this.
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.320]   And he was the first person.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:25.600]   He was basically like this lizard of AI
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:28.960]   where he discovered nuclear chain reaction.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.720]   Sutskever was the first person to train a neural network
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:35.360]   that accomplished, it was called ImageNet.
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.560]   And anyway, so like he's from that moment on,
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:40.560]   he was one of these scientists who like,
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:42.080]   he sees like, "Oh, you could build a nuclear bomb
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.560]   immediately as soon as the news hits the floor."
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.400]   10 years ago, he saw this coming, like we scaled this up
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.440]   and you've got something that's human level intelligent.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.840]   Anyways, I mean, I was reading through the book
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.960]   and so many things like this came up.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:58.280]   One was a good friend of mine works at one of these companies
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:02.160]   and he does, you know, they train these models on GPUs,
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.320]   which are computers that can perform
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.800]   all these matrix calculations at peril.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:10.120]   And I was thinking about these engineers
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:13.960]   who were in short supply during the making of the bomb
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:15.400]   who were, you know, let's say they're working
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:20.400]   on the electromagnetic separation of the isotopes, right?
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.400]   And it's like this really esoteric thing,
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.400]   you're like a chemist or a metallurgist or something
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:27.560]   that you're like really needed for this specific thing.
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.520]   And he's like in super high demand right now.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:31.360]   He's like the one guy who can make these like
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.200]   very particular machines run as efficiently as possible.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.000]   So you start looking and there's so many analogies there.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.840]   - Well, I mean, look, I don't think there's much question
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.720]   that AI is going to be at least as transformative
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:47.400]   as nuclear weapons and nuclear energy.
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.400]   - Yeah.
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.880]   - And it's scaring the hell out of a lot of people
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:51.960]   and a lot of other people
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:54.120]   are putting their heads in the sand
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:57.920]   and others are saying, let's loop it around with laws,
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:00.040]   which certainly we should do.
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:02.000]   We've tried to do that with nuclear weapons
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.800]   and have some success,
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.120]   but people have no idea what's coming, do they?
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:07.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.160]   Well, this is the thing I wanted to ask is
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:12.000]   one thing that impressed me is that, you know,
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.240]   some of these scientists didn't see this.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:17.920]   They were, I think Fermi was like, you could never isolate,
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.920]   you can never refine uranium and get 235.
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:24.040]   But then some of these scientists like saw it coming
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.920]   and I was actually impressed, I forget who,
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.960]   but a few of them got it down to the year
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:29.560]   where they're like, you know, by this time,
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:30.920]   we'll have built the atomic bomb.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.320]   By this time, another one was like, you know,
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:35.400]   Russia is like five to 10 years behind or something.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.400]   So I'm curious what made some of these scientists
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:39.840]   really good at forecasting
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.640]   the development of this technology and its maturity
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:49.000]   and what made some either too pessimistic or too optimistic?
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]   Like, is there some pattern you noticed
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.760]   among the ones who could see the progression of technology?
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.000]   That's a good question.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.360]   Well, the experience that I've had
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:00.720]   in working with scientists, physicists,
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.720]   is that they really are not very interested in history
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.520]   or in the future.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.480]   They're interested in now, where the work is,
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.680]   where the cutting edge is.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:15.360]   They'd have to devote quite a bit of energy
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:17.360]   to projecting in the future.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.440]   There, of course, have been a few.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:23.440]   I mean, one thinks of some of the guys
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.880]   who wrote science fiction,
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.640]   some of the guys who wrote essays and so forth
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.720]   about where we were going.
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:33.800]   And if you ask them, particularly later on in their careers,
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.440]   when their basic work is already done,
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.280]   and I remember talking to a Nobel Laureate
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.200]   in another line of science,
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:45.800]   but he said, "I would never be a graduate student
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:47.720]   connecting up with a Nobel Prize winner
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:49.920]   because they've already done their best work."
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:54.200]   And he was one, so he was talking about himself too.
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:59.360]   So it takes a certain mentality to do that.
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:02.120]   And maybe scientists aren't the best ones to do it.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.800]   Alvarez told me, he said, "You know, I was always a snoop,
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.880]   and I would poke around at Berkeley
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.440]   in the various drawers of the benches in the laboratory."
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.000]   He said, "One day I was poking around,
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000]   and I found this little glass cylinder
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:20.080]   about the size of a Petri dish with some wires inside."
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:23.440]   He said, "And I realized it was the first cyclotron.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:26.920]   They'd just thrown it in a drawer."
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.080]   I said, "So where is it now?"
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.520]   He said, "It's in the Smithsonian, of course.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:31.960]   Where else would it be?"
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:36.880]   I talked to the guy who invented the first laser
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:39.920]   and actually held one in my hand, the first laser.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:44.920]   He was an engineer at one of the big telephone companies.
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:49.920]   He said, "There's a laser.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:54.000]   The first laser is supposedly in the Smithsonian."
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.360]   But he said, "They don't have it.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.800]   They got one in the lab, and I took my first one home."
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:01.920]   He said, "You want to see it?"
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.440]   I said, "God, of course."
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:06.400]   So we went to the credenza in his dining room,
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:08.960]   and he opened the drawer and pulled out a little box,
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:12.880]   and inside it was basically a cylinder of aluminum
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:17.120]   about the size of a film can, a little film can,
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:22.080]   which he opened up and took out a man-made ruby cylinder
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.320]   that was half-silvered on each end,
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.000]   surrounded by a very high-intensity flashbulb.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.320]   And that was it.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:32.120]   It was this beautiful, simple machine.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:34.920]   But he said, "They didn't get the right one."
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.120]   I said, "Why didn't you get the right one?"
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.520]   He said, "They didn't ask me."
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:42.080]   And he was angry all his life
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:45.320]   because he wasn't included in the Nobel Prizes.
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:48.840]   He went to the theoreticians who first theorized a laser,
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:51.160]   but he built the first laser.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.920]   There it was, so.
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:55.160]   - When you were interviewing the scientists,
[01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:59.800]   how many of them do you feel regretted their work?
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:01.800]   - You know, they'd been down the road so far,
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:05.200]   they really didn't think that way anymore.
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:07.640]   What they did think about was they regretted
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:11.320]   the way governments had handled their work,
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.160]   and most of them, there were some
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:16.040]   who were kind of hawks and patriots.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:18.160]   Alvarez was one of those.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.760]   But most of them had tried in the years since the war
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.680]   to move in the direction of reducing nuclear weapons,
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:27.920]   limiting nuclear weapons, eliminating nuclear weapons.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:30.960]   It was a problem for them.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:34.840]   When the war was over, these were mostly graduate students
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.000]   or new PhDs who had been recruited for this program.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.440]   The average age at Los Alamos was 27.
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:47.400]   Oppenheimer was an old guy, he was 39, right?
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.120]   So these were young guys who'd been pulled out
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.640]   of their lives, pulled out of their careers.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.480]   They wanted to get back to the university
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.920]   and do the work they had started out to do.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.560]   And by and large, they did, and Los Alamos just emptied out.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.800]   Teller was horrified.
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:04.520]   Teller wanted the bomb program to continue
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:07.200]   because he wanted to build his hydrogen bomb.
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:11.520]   It was gonna be his bid for history,
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.480]   just as Oppenheimer's bid for history
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.960]   was the fission bomb, if you will.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.960]   Teller's was going to be the hydrogen bomb.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:22.240]   And over the years, after that work was done,
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:27.240]   he systematically and meanly tried to exclude one by one
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:32.040]   anyone else who'd helped him work on the hydrogen bomb.
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:36.000]   I mean, originally he said it was a mathematician,
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.600]   a Polish mathematician named Stan Ulam,
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:40.680]   whom I did interview also,
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:42.560]   who really came up with the basic idea
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:45.240]   for the hydrogen bomb and took it to Teller.
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:48.360]   And together, Teller came up with an improvement.
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.200]   And then together, they wrote a paper
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.320]   which was signed by both of them.
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:55.720]   But by the 1980s, Teller was saying,
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:00.120]   "Ulam did nothing, nothing," which wasn't true.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:03.080]   But it was his piece of history
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.080]   'cause he was scattered too,
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:08.040]   and he never did Nobel-level work.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:14.360]   So they didn't talk so much about their personal guilt.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:18.760]   And I mean, honestly, I was a child in the Second World War.
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:21.680]   I was eight years old in 1945.
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:25.840]   So many young men had been killed on all sides in the war.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:31.440]   It was kind of a strange, peaceful time for children.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:34.000]   Cars couldn't get tires, they were rationed.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.280]   Cars couldn't get gasoline, it was rationed.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:39.440]   So the streets were empty.
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.400]   We played in the streets.
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.560]   Meat was rationed.
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:45.760]   So we lived on macaroni and cheese.
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.760]   You got four ounces of meat a week per person
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:52.560]   during the Second World War and so forth.
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:55.040]   And that was kind of wonderful and peaceful
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:58.240]   and kids running around in gangs and so forth.
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.040]   But in at least one house in almost every block in the city,
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:07.000]   there was a black velvet flag or drape
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.800]   hanging with a gold star on it.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:11.600]   And that meant that someone in that family,
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.280]   a father, a brother, a son, had been killed.
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:18.000]   And I was a smart little kid.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.440]   I understood what all that meant.
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:22.440]   I was reading newspapers by the time I was six
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:23.720]   following the war.
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:29.360]   It was the strangest time of darkness and terror.
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:33.520]   We didn't know until 1943 if we were gonna win the war.
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:37.160]   It was scary for a while up front, the war in Europe.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.680]   We sort of set Japan aside, our government did,
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.320]   until the war in Europe was done
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:44.680]   before we finished that other war.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:46.520]   But it took a while for the United States
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:49.240]   to get its industrial plant up
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.200]   and cranking out planes at the rate of one a day
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:54.880]   or more and so forth.
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:57.000]   You know, Churchill famously said
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.680]   when Pearl Harbor occurred,
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.840]   "The Lord hath delivered them into my hands," he said.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.840]   And he explained later what he meant was,
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:08.840]   that means America's gonna join the war
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.080]   and I know we can win now
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:14.160]   because America's just one vast factory.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.880]   Much more so than the British could have put together.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:19.760]   So it was a peaceful time,
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:22.600]   but it was a very dark time even for a child.
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.440]   I understood well enough what it meant
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:27.080]   that my mother died when I was an infant,
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:30.920]   so I understood what the death of a family member was about.
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:34.040]   - Do you remember when the bombs dropped?
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:39.040]   - So by 1945, we were so pissed off at the Japanese.
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:42.080]   We had destroyed their Air Force,
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:45.240]   we had destroyed their Navy, we had destroyed their Army.
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.120]   The population of Japan was down
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:49.600]   to about a thousand calories per person.
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:52.480]   Of the worst kind of stuff, buckwheat and weeds
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:57.480]   and whatever they could find, and yet they wouldn't surrender.
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:59.040]   And they still had a million men
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.080]   on the ground in Western Manchuria.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:05.880]   They only had about a year's worth of bullets left.
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:10.000]   We knew that much, but that's a long time
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.160]   with a million men.
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:14.800]   With that in mind, and because they felt
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:17.280]   that the Soviet Union was still neutral
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.120]   on the Eastern Front,
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:21.600]   because it had basically fought the war in Europe.
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:24.240]   We didn't win the war in Europe, the Russians did.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:28.960]   We didn't enter the war on the ground until June, 1944,
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:32.200]   by which time they were already moving forward
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:36.720]   against the German forces that had attacked them in '41.
[02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:39.800]   So we didn't win the war in Europe, the Russians did,
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:44.040]   but the Japanese just wouldn't surrender.
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:48.240]   And I mean, you could read the documents about the bombs.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:51.000]   General George Marshall, who was leading the war,
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.200]   was in charge of all the forces,
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.640]   had this idea that maybe if we could use these bombs
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:00.440]   on the beaches before we landed
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:04.640]   to kill any Japanese defense that was there,
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:07.360]   maybe they would get the message and be shocked,
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.560]   he said, and to surrender.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:11.200]   But from the Japanese point of view,
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:13.040]   as it turned out later,
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:15.400]   you know, it's a myth that the bombs won the war.
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:17.160]   They contributed to winning the war,
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:18.880]   but they didn't win the war.
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:23.880]   What won the war was when Stalin finally was convinced
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:27.200]   that there were such things as atomic bombs.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:30.760]   He was half convinced these were American pieces
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:35.560]   of disinformation, that we were feeding the espionage
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:38.560]   to the Soviet Union to make him spend a lot of money
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:42.400]   and waste a lot of time for something that didn't exist.
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:46.440]   When the news came back, which it did almost immediately
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:49.080]   from Hiroshima and then from Nagasaki,
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:50.920]   that these things existed,
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:54.440]   he called Igor Kurchatov in and said famously,
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.960]   "Comrade, give us the bomb.
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:01.080]   You have all the resources of the state at your disposal.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.320]   Give us the bomb as soon as you can."
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:07.400]   But up until then, he wasn't so sure.
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:10.960]   He had told Truman and Potsdam that they would invade
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:15.960]   Manchuria with fresh Soviet forces on the 15th of August.
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:21.920]   And Truman was trying to get him to agree to invade at all.
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:27.760]   And then when word came from New Mexico
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:31.680]   that the bomb had worked, which it did right in the middle
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:34.640]   of the Potsdam Conference, Truman then was trying
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:38.000]   to get Stalin to come in as late as possible
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.280]   because he figured the bombs would end the war
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:44.840]   before Stalin could take over enough of Japan
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:48.400]   to divide the country the way Europe was divided.
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:51.880]   He didn't want a Soviet zone and an American zone
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:53.600]   and a British zone.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.960]   He knew we could do better with the Japanese
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:57.360]   than the Soviets would do.
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:03.200]   But Stalin, having heard that the bombs really worked,
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:06.280]   moved up the date of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:10.080]   to the 8th of August between Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.480]   and invaded early.
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:17.440]   I found it very interesting that the conventional Air Forces
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:22.080]   on our side, who staged the largest firebombing raid
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:26.920]   of the war, the 14th of August, after the Japanese
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:29.760]   were in the middle of their surrender negotiations.
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:33.600]   The Air Force wanted to get credit for winning the war
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:36.040]   and they wanted to hold back the Soviets
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:39.200]   who were advancing down from Sakhalin Island
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:41.520]   to the northern islands of Japan,
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:44.320]   as well as inward from Manchuria.
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:48.080]   And so our bombing was in northern Japan.
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:50.600]   It was like a way of telling the Soviets,
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:54.880]   "Back off, buddy, we're not gonna let you in here."
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:59.160]   And then the Japanese leadership, the military leadership,
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:01.560]   which had been adamant that they would fight
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:06.400]   to the last Japanese, the 100 million, they called it,
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.320]   turned and finally realized that it was futile.
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:12.400]   And with the fresh Soviet Army coming into Manchuria,
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.520]   with the United States and the British coming in
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.280]   from the west and the south, they were surrounded
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:19.400]   and there was no reason to continue.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:22.600]   But the bombs had their effect.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:25.920]   The Japanese emperor used the bombings
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.560]   of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a reason for entering politics
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:33.680]   for the first time in Japanese history.
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:37.120]   He had always been a spiritual figure,
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:40.200]   but he wasn't allowed to kind of vote or veto
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.240]   the political arrangements.
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:45.440]   He stepped forth and said, "We must do for peace."
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.440]   And in his final imperial rescript on the 15th of August,
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.560]   recorded and played out to the people by radio,
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:55.800]   he said, "A new and most terrible weapon of war
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.560]   has led us to think the unthinkable,
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:01.480]   and we must now lay down our arms."
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:03.080]   So the bomb had its effect,
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:06.680]   but it wasn't what we thought at the time.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:10.080]   A lot of Americans said, "Thank God for the atomic bomb,"
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:12.240]   because our voice came home.
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:14.520]   The actor Paul Newman was a friend of mine,
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:18.280]   and Paul was an 18-year-old bombardier
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.520]   on a two-man Navy firebomber
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:23.080]   training for the invasion of Japan.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.200]   He said to me once, "Rhodes, I'm one of those guys
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:29.240]   who said, 'Thank God for the atomic bomb,'
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:31.520]   because I probably wouldn't have come home
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.960]   if we'd invaded the Japanese home islands."
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:37.800]   And a million men said that.
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:41.200]   And the truth is, there were so many Japanese
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.040]   who would have been killed if we had invaded,
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:47.440]   that even the killings of the two bombs
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.000]   would have been dwarfed by the killing that happened.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.960]   For the first time in the history of war,
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.160]   more Japanese civilians were killed in World War II
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.120]   than had ever been killed in a war before.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:04.240]   War was beginning to become what it has since become,
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:07.160]   which is a war against civilians, basically.
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:08.680]   - So one question I have,
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:10.400]   we were talking near the beginning
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.320]   about whether it was possible
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:14.400]   that the bomb could not have been built at all.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.320]   And it seems like in the case of
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:17.680]   the nuclear physics involved here,
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:19.400]   it was sufficiently obvious.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:24.160]   But seeing the history of that science
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:27.400]   and whether it was plausible or not to,
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:31.480]   for some conspiracy to just say, you know, to hold it off,
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:33.440]   how plausible do you think it is
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:36.440]   that there's some group of scientists somewhere else
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:39.600]   who have discovered some other phenomenon or technology,
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:41.400]   and they're like, this is so destructive,
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.560]   we can't tell anyone about this.
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.200]   You know, one area I think this might be plausible
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.720]   is like bioweapons or something like that,
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:47.840]   where they discover something
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.200]   and they just like shut up about it.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.240]   Do you, given the study of this history,
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:53.160]   do you think that's more or less plausible?
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.960]   - I don't think it's very likely.
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.600]   To take bioweapons as an example,
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.080]   I remember talking to a biologist,
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.680]   one of the early DNA researchers
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:09.320]   who had been a physicist until DNA came along.
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.320]   And I said, "How'd you switch over to biology?"
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:13.640]   He said, "Well, it's molecules."
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:16.320]   So from his perspective, it wasn't very different.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.880]   But we were talking about the question
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:22.680]   of just the one you asked, but about biological agents.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:26.680]   He said, "You know, nature has had millions of years
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:29.360]   "to work all the combinations
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.320]   "on the worst things you can imagine.
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.840]   "The odds of anybody in a laboratory
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:37.080]   "coming up with anything worse
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:39.880]   "are really vanishingly small."
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:41.800]   I took that with great comfort.
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:44.120]   I went home and slept that night, you know?
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:46.720]   And I think he's probably right.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:50.840]   Evolution has been done such a job.
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:52.480]   We're still digging stuff out.
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:55.760]   I mean, it's just amazing how much of our technology
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.720]   started out as something in the natural world
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:02.360]   that we adapted it and simplified it and engineered it
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:04.200]   so we could make it too.
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:07.840]   That's still going on in all sorts of ways.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:09.480]   - I hope that's the case.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:11.320]   You know, I was talking to a biologist
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:12.800]   and he was explaining to me,
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:15.080]   if you've seen things like AlphaFold,
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:17.400]   which is this AI program that models,
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:19.440]   that can predict how a protein will fold,
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:24.080]   you can run billions of different permutations of a protein
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:26.000]   and you can find smallpox,
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.920]   but it binds a hundred times better
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:31.360]   with human receptors or something.
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:32.720]   - Well, I'll tell you a story,
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:35.160]   which I don't think is well known.
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.320]   I wish it were.
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:39.360]   Back in the '60s, I think,
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.320]   the Russians proposed a world-scale program
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.640]   of public health to eradicate smallpox to the UN.
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:53.040]   And they said, "We'll contribute vaccine."
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:56.040]   And other countries can contribute
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.960]   whatever they can contribute.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.680]   This program got going.
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:03.880]   It was run out of Geneva
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.080]   by the World Health Organization.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:10.480]   A wonderful American public health doctor,
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:13.320]   big old burly country boy looking guy,
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:15.320]   who was D.A. Henderson,
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:17.920]   who I followed around for several months,
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:20.080]   once in Geneva and elsewhere.
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:25.080]   And by the late 1970s,
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:27.880]   the last case was smallpox,
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:29.840]   which happened to be a disease
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:32.360]   that's only spread among humans.
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:34.440]   And therefore was of all the diseases,
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.960]   the most obvious one to try to get rid of.
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.080]   Because if there are reservoirs
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:41.920]   in the natural world outside of the human world,
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:43.800]   then get to be a problem.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.640]   It's also something that's carried around
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:48.040]   by rabbits or deer or whatever,
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:49.480]   then it's harder to deal with.
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:51.640]   But if it's just humans,
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:52.920]   then all you have to do
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:55.240]   is start showing signs of smallpox
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:57.560]   and vaccinate everyone around him,
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.080]   and make sure they don't go anywhere for a while.
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:02.480]   And the disease can't spread.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.360]   And that's the method that they use
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:07.000]   to eliminate smallpox everywhere in the world.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.800]   And then in the '90s,
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:12.400]   when the Soviet Union collapsed,
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:15.080]   D.A. learned, as we all did,
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:17.680]   although it wasn't terribly well publicized,
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.880]   that there was a secret lab still operating,
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:23.760]   that the Russian plan had been
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:28.640]   to eliminate smallpox vaccination from the world,
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:33.440]   so that everybody except people in their country,
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.840]   who had been vaccinated for this purpose,
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.560]   would not be immune.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:43.360]   And a bacteriological agent like smallpox
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.520]   could be used as a weapon of war.
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:46.520]   - Yeah.
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:49.680]   - D.A. was so incensed,
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:52.000]   he took this story to our government,
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.520]   and we started a whole new section
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.680]   of the public health business
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:59.720]   to work on biological warfare.
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:03.200]   And he did for the last part of his life
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:04.640]   to try to get past this.
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:07.760]   And that lab was eventually, we hope, closed down.
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:14.080]   So that scenario is not outside the bounds of possibility.
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.440]   But generally speaking,
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.520]   biological warfare isn't very effective
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:21.840]   because your own people could be infected as well,
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.360]   if not your real war people,
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:25.640]   at least your civilian population.
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:27.360]   Much like poison gas,
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.160]   which used to blow back over the lives of the people
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:33.440]   who launched it, to their horror.
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:36.320]   So it never was a terribly good weapon of war,
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.280]   and it's one of the reasons,
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:40.240]   plus Hitler's experience of being gassed
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:41.080]   in the First World War,
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:44.640]   that all sides decided not to use it in the second.
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:46.120]   So that's part of it.
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.040]   - Speaking of secret labs, by the way,
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.680]   is there a question you have about,
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:53.480]   I mean, you've written so many books
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.760]   about not only the atomic bomb,
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.200]   the hydrogen bomb, and the Cold War, and so on.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.720]   Is there a question you have about any of those stories
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:01.960]   that you, one you're really interested in,
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:03.800]   that you haven't been able to get the answer to
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:06.080]   because the information is classified?
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:09.600]   - You know, over the years, it's slowly leaked out.
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.080]   Latest thing I discovered is that from early on,
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:17.080]   our hydrogen bombs were used as spherical secondary.
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:20.640]   They were shaped sort of like a dumbbell.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:22.720]   Not quite so, more spread out,
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:27.720]   but there's a picture of Kim Jong-un holding a,
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:32.640]   looking at a hydrogen bomb of North Korean make,
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:35.280]   and it's perfectly obvious that it's a real bomb
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.440]   'cause that's its configuration.
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:41.680]   So I didn't know that until just a year or so ago.
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:43.640]   But I mean, sooner or later,
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:45.880]   everyone tells you at least a little bit of the-
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:47.720]   - And then is there anything you've learned
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:49.960]   but you can't put in your books because it's-
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:53.680]   - The only thing I didn't put in the book, rightly so,
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:56.680]   was the dimensions of the Fat Man bomb
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:01.360]   that were on the original Fuchs documents
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:03.040]   that he passed to the Russians.
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.120]   When the Soviet Union collapsed
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:08.640]   and the scientists became available,
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:11.400]   I learned that the KGB,
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:14.440]   in the interest of promoting its service to the state
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.200]   in this new world they were going into,
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.360]   had published a historical piece about their good work
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:23.960]   in stealing the secret to the bomb.
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:26.920]   And they included a picture of the sketch
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:29.960]   that Fuchs did showing the dimensions
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:31.400]   of each of the shells
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:34.600]   of this multi-shelled implosion weapon
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:37.640]   with the numbers there in millimeters.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:40.480]   And when they realized,
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:42.080]   when the scientists realized
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:44.880]   that the KGB had published this stuff,
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:47.200]   they raised a great hue and cry and said,
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.520]   "That's in violation
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:51.080]   of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty."
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:54.920]   They said, "We got to pull all the issues of that journal."
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:56.600]   And they did.
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:00.520]   But I had a very enterprising assistant in Moscow,
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.960]   this geologist I mentioned before.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:04.680]   And he said, "I think I know
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:06.720]   where I can find a copy of the journal."
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:08.160]   And he jumped on the night train
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.640]   from Moscow to St. Petersburg
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:14.320]   and went to a science library there.
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.320]   And they said, "No, of course not.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:17.280]   We pulled that."
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:18.320]   And then he thought, "Wait a minute.
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.000]   Where's the public library?"
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.240]   It was across the street.
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:22.640]   And he went across the public library
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:24.320]   and he said, "Yeah, we have the journal."
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.160]   And handed it to him.
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:27.360]   He made a copy and gave me one.
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:29.600]   But when I realized that I had this,
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:32.280]   I never published that information.
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:34.240]   That's the only one, though.
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.560]   - That is a wise thing to do.
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:37.400]   - Yeah.
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:38.400]   - One of the final questions.
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:41.840]   A lot of times people use the phrase,
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:44.240]   you know, "We need a Manhattan Project for X."
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:48.600]   If it's some new technology or something.
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:49.600]   When you hear that,
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:53.880]   do you think this is like a sort of naive comparison
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:56.600]   or does it make sense to use that terminology?
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:00.760]   - No, you know, it's been used so many times over the years
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:02.760]   for cancer, for this, for that.
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:05.320]   It was a very special time
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:07.400]   and it was a very special problem.
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:09.760]   The basic science was in hand.
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:12.600]   Oppenheimer once said in his funny way,
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.400]   he said, "We didn't do any basic science
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:17.640]   between 1939 and 1945."
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:21.760]   In a sense, it was a vast engineering program.
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:25.160]   There was some basic physics, but very little.
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:28.640]   It was mostly using Nobel Laureate level physicists
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:31.800]   as engineers to develop a whole new weapon
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:35.000]   with the precision of a Swiss watch
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.760]   that weighed 9,000 pounds.
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:38.480]   They did a beautiful job,
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.760]   considering the time and place and the rush
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:42.280]   and all those things.
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:43.560]   They solved some problems
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:45.520]   that I don't know how anybody else could have solved.
[02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:50.520]   Like, how do you make plutonium explode without a gun?
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:52.320]   So, all of that.
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:55.600]   But, you know, most of these problems aren't like that.
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:59.480]   Nobody was starting a startup
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.680]   with some investment from an investment company
[02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:04.760]   to build the bomb.
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:07.400]   This was a government project and it was secret.
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:10.400]   And if you divulged the secret, you'd go to jail.
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:15.240]   A lot of the parameters of what they were doing
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:17.880]   were carefully kept secret.
[02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:22.720]   It's remarkable that 600,000 people worked on the bomb
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:24.000]   and the secret never got out.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.400]   - Did you say 600,000?
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:26.240]   - Yeah.
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:29.120]   - This is actually one of the questions I want to ask you.
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:31.320]   Truman, when he became president,
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:33.520]   he had to be told about the,
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:35.360]   he didn't know about it, right?
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:36.840]   So, the vice president of the United States,
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.320]   600,000 people, at the time,
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:39.320]   I don't know how many people were working on it
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:40.600]   when he became president,
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:43.280]   but hundreds of thousands of people are working on it.
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:45.360]   The vice president doesn't know about it.
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:47.080]   He only learns about it as president.
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:50.800]   How was it possible that with so many people working on it,
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:51.960]   the vice president doesn't know
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.760]   that the atom bomb is in the works?
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:56.320]   Like, how did they keep that so under wraps?
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:00.320]   - One of Roosevelt's several vice presidents famously said,
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:04.760]   "The vice presidency isn't worth a bucket of warm piss."
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:07.040]   - Okay, you know, Kennedy had a saying,
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:09.480]   "I'm against vice in all its forms."
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:11.200]   (laughing)
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:13.040]   - Yes, well, interesting for me.
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:15.280]   (laughing)
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:20.560]   Roosevelt wanted it kept secret and said it grows.
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:22.000]   They didn't want the word to get out.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.520]   They didn't want the Germans to get ahead of us.
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:26.600]   And what was the vice president for?
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:29.000]   He was to sit around in a waiting room
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.160]   in case the president died,
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.960]   which in Truman's case, he hit the jackpot.
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:35.320]   So he was just at the right time
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:37.360]   'cause Roosevelt had several vice presidents
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:39.360]   in the course of his long reign.
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:42.440]   So from their point of view, he didn't need to know.
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:45.040]   So he didn't, I mean, it was the need to know thing again.
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:46.760]   It was compartmentalization.
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:49.520]   And of course, as soon as he became president,
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:53.280]   Groves and Stimson and several others
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:55.920]   got together with Truman and filled him in on it.
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:00.480]   Truman had some inkling because he was a crusading senator
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:05.480]   who had taken on the job of preventing waste in war.
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:09.280]   And if he heard about some industry that was sloughing off
[02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:12.080]   and putting money in people's pockets or whatever,
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:15.280]   he would go visit their factories, call them out.
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:20.280]   And he was ready to go to Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:23.320]   and find out what these people were doing.
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:27.080]   But Stimson, whom he greatly admired,
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:29.220]   the secretary of war at the time,
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:31.960]   one of the great elder statesmen of the era,
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:34.480]   said, "Mr. Vice President, please don't go.
[02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:36.520]   "I guarantee you that what is happening
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:38.440]   "is being well-managed.
[02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:39.320]   "Please don't go."
[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.860]   And he said, "If you say so, Mr. Stimson,
[02:23:41.860 --> 02:23:43.540]   "I will believe you."
[02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:46.380]   So he knew a little bit, but he didn't know very much.
[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:50.760]   So, and, you know, I don't think that helped.
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:53.400]   I don't know how much Roosevelt understood either.
[02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:56.000]   He was not a scientist.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.200]   Truman was not even a college graduate.
[02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:03.040]   Truman was self-educated and a well-self-educated guy.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:04.920]   Someone once said, "Every time I go to the Library
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:08.040]   "of Congress, it's one of the senators to pull out a book.
[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:10.640]   "Truman's name is always there."
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:12.680]   I think he read everything in the Library of Congress
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:14.640]   that the senator said.
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.160]   - So how the secret was, imagine today.
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.320]   I mean, it's partly there wasn't any way to communicate
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.320]   except by letter or telephone,
[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:25.880]   and you didn't call long distance
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:28.600]   unless somebody died, basically.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:30.600]   Tell someone they had a long distance call
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:33.380]   and the woman would start crying.
[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:35.040]   Or a man, for that matter.
[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:38.360]   You thought your son was probably dead in Iwo Jima.
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:41.920]   So the communication was more limited, to be sure.
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:45.120]   But even so, it's extraordinary.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:47.920]   - Was the culture different in that the idea
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:51.080]   of leaking something would be much more frowned upon
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:52.560]   than it is now?
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:55.880]   - I can't remember in my entire life
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:25:00.400]   a more patriotic time than the Second World War.
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:03.640]   We children gathered together pieces of tinfoil
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:06.240]   from the lining of cigarette packages,
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.800]   about the only place you could get tinfoil in those days.
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:11.240]   Aluminum foil.
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:14.000]   Watered it up into balls and took them to school
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.720]   so they could use it to make bombers.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:20.200]   We collected the bacon grease from cooking meat
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:22.800]   in the kitchen and took it to school in cans
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:26.720]   because it had some application to making bullets.
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:29.620]   We collected newspapers for the same reason.
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.980]   The Boy Scouts, during the Second World War,
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:34.660]   took it as their special responsibility
[02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:39.280]   to collect the fibers that come off milkweed
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:43.440]   with this little ball that blows away
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:46.520]   because it was used in place of kapok
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:51.520]   to line life vests for sailors.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:56.860]   They collected 500,000 tons of milkweed fluff
[02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:00.280]   in the course of the war.
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:05.080]   We were all consumed with winning this thing,
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:07.400]   which didn't seem to be a certain thing at all,
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:11.640]   as I said earlier, before around 1943.
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:15.260]   And in that world, even though, of course,
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:18.160]   there was a black market and people got to see a farmer
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:20.780]   and pick up some steaks so they didn't have to live
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:23.480]   on some more macaroni and cheese for the next month
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:28.480]   as we all did, but despite those changes,
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:31.960]   people were very, very patriotic
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:35.160]   and fought in every way we could to win the war.
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:36.760]   - Speaking of elder statesmen, by the way,
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.280]   who, since the development of the nuclear bomb,
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:42.720]   has been the wisest political leader?
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:44.760]   Not necessarily in the U.S.
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:47.040]   and not even necessarily as a leader of state,
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:50.760]   but contributed most to the stability and peace.
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:53.760]   - You know, it depends on what period you're talking about.
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:57.560]   There's no question that Oppenheimer's advice
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.240]   to the government after the war was really good.
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.560]   I said, I don't think anyone except the Oppenheimer
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:08.080]   committee, the Atchison, Lillienthal committee,
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:10.960]   has ever found a better way of thinking about
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:13.320]   eliminating nuclear weapons in a world
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:15.320]   that understands how to build them.
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:16.840]   And that really was Oppenheimer.
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:18.600]   I don't mean he deluded anybody.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:21.760]   He just led them straight down the path.
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:24.520]   All these engineers and industrialists
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.960]   who were on the committee with him, skeptical men,
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:29.880]   men who wouldn't have been easily convinced of anything,
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:32.800]   but he convinced them this was the right way to go.
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:36.480]   So he, up until he was forced out of government
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:39.080]   because he made the mistake of not supporting
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.720]   the Air Force's favorite bomb,
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:44.200]   when they found a way to destroy him, basically,
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.680]   and they did destroy him.
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:47.120]   I talked to one of the scientists
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:49.240]   who was his closest friend, and he said,
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:51.200]   "Robert was never the same."
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.280]   After the security hearing in 1954,
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:59.120]   he was one of Yates's smiling public men after that.
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:03.120]   It really devastated him, that basic insecurity he had
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:06.400]   as a Jew in America, if you will,
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:10.160]   from all the way from childhood, haunted him.
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:11.560]   And he became the director
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:13.360]   of the Institute for Advanced Study,
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:18.360]   and he wrote a lot of nice essays, but so, I don't know.
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:24.360]   The leader that I've fallen into more and more is Niels Bohr.
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:26.640]   Niels Bohr tried to figure out a way
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:31.320]   to bring the openness of science
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.880]   into a world without nuclear weapons.
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:40.880]   And he fell up against, I mean, he really,
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:44.760]   he and Ravi taught Oppenheimer the ideas
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:48.320]   that ended up in the Atchison-Villianthal plan.
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:51.160]   And he and Ravi later were the ones
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:56.160]   who started up the scientific laboratory
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.640]   in Geneva that is now CERN,
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:04.760]   where they built these new giant colliders,
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:07.320]   with the idea in mind that at very least,
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:10.480]   if the scientists have devastated Europe,
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:12.080]   we remember what things were like
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:14.320]   for the former Soviet Union.
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:16.160]   People were living on crusts of bread
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:18.760]   and bags of old potatoes, they really were.
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:20.760]   And particularly people who'd worked for the government
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.800]   because their pensions weren't worth anything.
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:25.880]   That's what I saw when I went back there
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:30.880]   in the spring of '92, after the place collapsed.
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:33.880]   It just wasn't, the money wasn't worth anything.
[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:35.720]   Their salaries weren't being paid.
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:38.960]   In the midst of all of that,
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:42.240]   Europe needed something to sustain it.
[02:29:42.240 --> 02:29:44.040]   And of course there was the Marshall Plan,
[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:46.040]   and that was absolutely amazing,
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.320]   and it's the help it gave to Europe when it needed it most.
[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:52.040]   But Bohr wanted to make sure,
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:54.200]   and Rabi wanted to make sure that the scientists
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:56.440]   of Europe weren't tapped to go off somewhere
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:58.440]   and build nuclear weapons.
[02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:02.480]   And they invented this international laboratory in Geneva,
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:05.120]   which is still a thriving enterprise,
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:07.360]   where they could do basic physics,
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.120]   and where they'd be paid for their work
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:11.800]   and could do the kind of exciting thing
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:15.480]   that good science is, without having to drift over
[02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:17.680]   into the dark side of the whole thing.
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:19.920]   I don't know to the extent to, well, I mean,
[02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:22.080]   let's face it, it more or less worked.
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:24.600]   The French had to have the bomb, you know,
[02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:26.040]   because they're French.
[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:29.920]   - They need their lovers, they need their bomb.
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:31.480]   - The British had to have the bomb
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.200]   because they knew how to build one.
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:35.400]   They'd worked with us all during the war,
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:38.120]   and then we'd cut them off from a supply of uranium
[02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:42.560]   and from any new developments along the way,
[02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:45.760]   and most of all, because the British Empire was bankrupt
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:47.440]   by the end of the Second World War,
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:49.520]   and Churchill was determined to get the bomb
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:52.720]   because without it, his country would fall away
[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:55.600]   and wouldn't get to sit at the table with the big boys.
[02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:59.600]   So they had reasons, typical reasons for getting bombs,
[02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:01.800]   because you don't want to be left out
[02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:03.640]   because of the prestige,
[02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:07.000]   or because you have an immortal enemy who's got the bomb,
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:08.440]   or is getting the bomb.
[02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:09.800]   That's North Korea.
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:14.800]   That's Iraq, its attempt, it didn't get there.
[02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:17.040]   That's Pakistan and India.
[02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:19.480]   The countries that did go for the bomb
[02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:20.760]   with the exception of the,
[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:23.120]   well, even the superpowers, really.
[02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:26.280]   We, because of Germany, the Soviets, because of us,
[02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:31.200]   by and large, the countries that did go toward the bomb
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:34.960]   finally built bombs because they were afraid
[02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:37.480]   of another country having the bomb,
[02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:39.200]   and everyone else stood back and said,
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:43.040]   "Well, if you'll protect us with bombs, with atomic bombs,
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:46.400]   "when somebody comes calling here in South Korea
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:50.320]   "or Germany or wherever, we won't build them."
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:52.800]   And share your knowledge of how to make energy
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:53.960]   out of nuclear power.
[02:31:53.960 --> 02:31:56.320]   - There's easily another three hours of questions
[02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:57.960]   I could ask you, but I want to be,
[02:31:57.960 --> 02:31:59.880]   I can't say I want to be respectful of your time
[02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:01.920]   'cause I haven't been with the extra hour I've taken,
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:04.200]   but I want to be less than,
[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:05.560]   totally disrespectful of your time.
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:10.320]   So I guess the final maybe question that we can go out on
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:13.200]   is next 50 years,
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:17.440]   what odds do you put on a non-test new going off?
[02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:19.320]   - A new going off in anger?
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:20.160]   - Yeah.
[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:22.360]   - That's the way I usually put it.
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:24.240]   I think the odds are high.
[02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:26.320]   - Over 50% next 50 years?
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:27.640]   - You know, I don't know.
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:29.200]   I wouldn't put a number on it,
[02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:32.000]   but it's certainly higher than zero,
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.040]   and it's probably higher than 10%,
[02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:37.640]   and that's high enough if we're talking about
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:39.680]   millions of people dying.
[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:41.560]   You know, people think, well,
[02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:43.800]   there was a period when people in the field
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:45.360]   were talking about, well,
[02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:47.520]   maybe we'll have a little regional nuclear war
[02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:49.000]   between India and Pakistan,
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000]   and that'll scare everybody to the point where
[02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.400]   they realize they gotta get rid of these things.
[02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:58.040]   The same guys who did the nuclear winter studies
[02:32:58.040 --> 02:33:01.880]   back in the '80s decided in 2007
[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:05.440]   first to look at nuclear winter world-scale war
[02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:08.600]   using the much better computers of today,
[02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:11.120]   and they found out that that would be even worse
[02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:11.960]   than they thought it would
[02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:16.240]   when they had only one-dimensional atmospheric models.
[02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:17.080]   Then they said, well,
[02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:19.160]   what would a small regional nuclear war look like?
[02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:23.360]   So they simulated a war between India and Pakistan
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:28.360]   where each country explodes 50 Hiroshima-sized,
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:33.800]   15-kiloton nuclear weapons over the enemy cities,
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:35.760]   and what would follow from that?
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:39.640]   And it turned out, as the model develops,
[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:40.920]   you can see it online.
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:43.720]   You can watch the graph develop,
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:48.400]   that even that small an exchange,
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:54.280]   less than some of our individual hydrogen bombs,
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:58.200]   about a megaton between the two countries,
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:03.200]   would be enough to cause enough fire from burning cities
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.520]   to spread smoke around the world
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:08.400]   and reduce the amount of sunlight.
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:10.120]   So they figured in the end
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:13.600]   that there would be 20 million prompt deaths
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:17.480]   from the explosions themselves and the fires.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.640]   But then over the course of the next several years,
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:24.400]   up to 2 billion people would die of starvation
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:26.720]   because you would have the same phenomenon
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:30.760]   that the world had in the 18th century, I think,
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:34.680]   when there was an interim of rather cold,
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:37.120]   the sun was pulling back a bit,
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:41.480]   and it was freezing hard in July in New England,
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:43.400]   and the crops failed,
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:45.760]   and a mass of people died worldwide
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:47.920]   during that period of time,
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:52.760]   something that, like the flu epidemic of 1918,
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:55.120]   everybody seems to have forgotten.
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:57.760]   I don't know where our memory goes with these things,
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:03.960]   and therefore even a small so-called nuclear war
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:06.880]   must engage the whole world
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:11.880]   because it's going to engage us if it ever goes off.
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:16.080]   So we're still in a very precarious place,
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:18.080]   and as long as any country in the world
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:20.960]   has nuclear weapons, we're going to continue to be.
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:24.080]   There is a sort of Damocles over our heads.
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:27.160]   That has been the price of nuclear deterrence.
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:30.560]   It isn't necessary that that be the price.
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:32.760]   It's possible to have nuclear deterrence
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:35.280]   without actual weapons,
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:37.760]   but it's damned hard to convince leaders,
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:41.400]   particularly in totalitarian and authoritarian countries,
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:42.600]   that that's the case.
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:46.560]   So I, you know, the odds, I don't know,
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:49.440]   but there's no such thing as a machine
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:51.720]   that doesn't malfunction sooner or later,
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:55.920]   and these machines, these weapons that we,
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:00.320]   make us such supernatural powers of are just machines.
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:03.160]   We put them together, we can take them apart.
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:06.760]   We can put the ore back in the ground if we want to.
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:09.080]   We don't have to live with this.
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:13.280]   I think we're in a big, wide, long transition.
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:17.520]   Maybe the world-scale problem of solving global warming
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:20.080]   will help with this, will help people see
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:23.160]   that if they work together, I mean, here I am saying
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:26.320]   there could be a good outcome from this technology.
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:29.280]   Well, there was a good outcome from the telephone.
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:31.840]   There was a good outcome from television,
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:33.720]   but there was also a dark side,
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:36.840]   and we're gonna have to learn to handle dark sides better.
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:39.480]   Maybe that's the last thing to say on this subject.
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:42.400]   - Yeah, that's a sound note to close on.
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:46.280]   The book is "The Making of the Atomic Bomb."
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:47.920]   Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to talk as much
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:49.960]   about your new book on energy,
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.440]   but when your next book comes out,
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:55.520]   we'll get a chance to talk about the remainder
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.040]   that we didn't get a chance to talk about.
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:00.200]   It's a true honor, incredible pleasure.
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:01.760]   Thank you so much for your-
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:02.600]   - My pleasure.
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:05.720]   - Yeah, for the stories, the insights.
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:07.280]   It was really wonderful.
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:08.120]   Thank you.
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:08.960]   - Thank you.
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:11.080]   - Hey, everybody.
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.960]   I hope you enjoyed that episode.
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:15.160]   As always, the most helpful thing you can do
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:16.960]   is to share the podcast.
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:18.680]   Send it to people you think might enjoy it,
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:20.800]   put it in Twitter, your group chats, et cetera.
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:22.640]   Just splits the world.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:23.880]   Appreciate you listening.
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.040]   I'll see you next time.
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:26.320]   Cheers.
