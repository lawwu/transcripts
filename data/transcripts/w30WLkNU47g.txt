[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   - He's ready to go.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.720]   Is that official merch?
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.820]   - I got it online, so I hope she's getting royalties.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.980]   I hope it's not a fugazi.
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.640]   - A fugazi, fugazi?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.720]   - What's up with your outfit, J. Cal?
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.360]   You going on Fox News again?
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.180]   - Dude, he just signed on to pick up a contributor.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.780]   - Wait, what?
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.300]   - He's a contributor.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.140]   - You're a contributor to Fox News?
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.340]   - He pays a week.
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.180]   They're paying me.
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.360]   - That's hysterical.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.200]   Wait, what?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   For real, for real.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.600]   - Yeah, he's the newest contributor.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.440]   - Oh my God, that's incredible.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.840]   Do they know you have TDS?
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.680]   Do they know about that?
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.920]   - No, they're looking for a moderate.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.840]   They want a moderate, independent thinker,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.880]   and they love Nostracanus.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.560]   They're branding Nostracanus.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.040]   - He has to finish this in two hours
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.680]   because he's taping with Jesse Waters after that.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.880]   - Oh my God.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.720]   Honestly, I will say that I saw both of your appearances
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.840]   on Jesse Waters, and I thought you crushed both of them.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   - Totally, you were excellent.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.000]   - I think it's actually a good move for them.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.880]   I like the idea.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.720]   Sax, you would love for me to be a contributor on Fox.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.680]   - I would.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.640]   - You would.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.480]   I'm pulling your leg.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.300]   I'm pulling your leg.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.140]   I'm pulling your leg.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.980]   They haven't made the effort.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.800]   They haven't made the effort.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.520]   - I want your training to continue, young padawan.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.360]   - Oh, really?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.000]   This is like, I will bring balance to the force?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.840]   - Yes, yes.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.660]   - I'm the chosen one?
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.640]   - You're the chosen one.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.520]   - You were my brother, Anakin.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520]   You were supposed to bring balance to the force, Anakin.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.120]   - Rain Man, David Saxon.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.840]   - And it said, we open sourced it to the fans,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.520]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.360]   - Love you, guys.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.020]   - I'm the queen of Kinwam.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.220]   ♪ I'm going all in ♪
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.060]   - All right, everybody,
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.660]   welcome back to the number one podcast in the world.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.280]   It's been confirmed by the CEO of Beep,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.440]   who told us we are the Beep podcast on his platform.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.940]   It's episode 186.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.720]   From the home office in Italy,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.480]   the chairman dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.560]   How you doing, brother?
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.520]   - Hello, Jason, how are you?
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.480]   - We're good, we're good.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.640]   We can see that we are definitely in July now,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.320]   because we have one button to go for August.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.920]   And so, it's kind of like the sundial.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.640]   You know, the Greeks, we created the sundial,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.000]   math, plumbing, philosophy, democracy,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.840]   all these great things.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.120]   - Oh, my gosh.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.960]   The Italians, you guys created bare chests.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.520]   - Can I tell you how good Italian white wine is
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.080]   on a hot, humid day?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   It may be the closest thing to ambrosia in modern society.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.480]   It's just so good.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.360]   - Is that your sports drink?
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.520]   It's just like, you get off the,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   I picture you on like a treadmill.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.120]   - I drink so much white wine during the summertime,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.700]   and I eat gelato every day,
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.820]   and I tend to still lose a couple pounds
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.660]   by the time I get home.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.840]   - A lot of walking, a lot of walking.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.680]   Let me ask you this.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.440]   Have you ever had a glass of wine while working out?
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.280]   Has that happened?
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.040]   Have you ever been tempted?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.880]   Be honest.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.480]   - I have tried to go for it.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360]   - You brought wine to the gym?
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.080]   I knew it!
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.600]   I knew it, that's the level of...
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.940]   (both laughing)
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.960]   Did you open the wine bottle in the gym,
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   or did you just like half and half the glass?
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.200]   - No, I opened it, it had to breathe.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.120]   I went, and then I had somebody
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.700]   just bring me a little sippy poops
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.860]   just so I could see if it was opening up properly.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.540]   - Okay, were you on the treadmill,
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.380]   or were you doing weights?
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.660]   Were you on the weight bench when you sipped?
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.320]   - Yeah, I was pushing weight.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.860]   - Okay, pushing weight, okay.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.140]   Back in '88, okay.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.340]   And getting ready, according to reports,
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.620]   I don't know if we can talk about this,
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.460]   but David Sachs is in the think tank,
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.180]   getting ready for his RNC debut.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.820]   How are you, Rain Man?
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.700]   Yeah, definitely, definitely giving a keynote.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.860]   - Well, I wasn't supposed to talk about that,
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.460]   but I saw that someone leaked it
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.200]   to the New York Times this morning, so it's out there.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.040]   - Okay.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.840]   - And yeah, I'm gonna be speaking there next week.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.680]   - Great.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.500]   Any theme that you're going for?
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.960]   You can give us a little idea of maybe a theme or two
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.800]   that you wanna--
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.520]   - There is a theme, but I don't wanna talk about it yet.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.360]   I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.880]   I'm not even supposed to say I'm doing it,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.560]   but it got out there, so I guess there's no hiding it.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.840]   - So we'll keep the cards close to the chest.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.760]   And from the mountains,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.660]   at the beep, beep,
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.920]   then he can talk about your sultan of science
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.560]   looking oddly not pale.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.680]   You got a little sun there, brother.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.040]   Looking good, day-free break.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.640]   - Lot of outdoor sunning happening last couple of weeks.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.800]   Yeah, enjoying the vitamin D.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.200]   - All right, gentlemen, let's get to the docket.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.440]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.900]   Let's start with macro.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.740]   We haven't talked macro.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.360]   Everybody wants us to talk a little macro.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.020]   And I got a lot of news today.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.440]   The big question is, has the soft landing been secured?
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.200]   Obviously, stocks are still surging.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.040]   Records again this week, last week.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.620]   All the jobs seem to have burned off,
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.040]   and unemployment is moving up.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.280]   That was one of J-Pow's major efforts.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.240]   And all the stimmy savings, as you pointed out,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.220]   Sharmarath, are long gone.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.120]   And today, the big news, CPI came in at 3%.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.840]   Perhaps inflation has been cracked.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.120]   Here's your chart, gentlemen.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.720]   Economists were expecting 3.1,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.120]   so the print was meaningfully cooler than expected.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.240]   And CPI actually fell 10 bps on a month-on-month basis.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.500]   Obviously, when you see that three handle,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.120]   that is year over year.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.600]   And this is the first time we had month-over-month CPI
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.240]   decreased since May of 2020.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.920]   So lowest CPI in three years, J-Pow said.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   The Fed doesn't need, he said this earlier this week,
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.720]   he doesn't need to see the 2% inflation to start the cuts.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.800]   Obviously, I guess he wants to steer
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.720]   or speed up going into the turn.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.160]   So September cut looks highly likely.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.400]   If you look at the prediction markets,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.520]   Fed funds futures now see an 89% chance
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.280]   of at least one rate cut by September.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.240]   That's up from 73% before the print,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.360]   according to FedWatch.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.760]   That's a tool that tracks interest rate traders.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   We discussed the Fed wanting to see employment
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.400]   and savings cool.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.760]   Well, in June, unemployment was 4.1%,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.280]   the highest since 2021, up from 4% in May.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.760]   Here's the stunning chart of unemployment since 1948.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.200]   In April 2023, unemployment bottomed out at 3.4%,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.440]   the lowest since any of us were born, 1969.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.360]   And you can see here, there's been an uptick
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.440]   from this incredible historic low.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.960]   So soft landing appears to be working.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.720]   The jobs market slowing down, inflation has dropped,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.120]   tempered, and the market continues to hit
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   all those all-time highs, S&P up 26% since last year,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.840]   mostly, of course, thanks to NVIDIA's
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.560]   record-breaking performance,
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.360]   but also Meta, Amazon, Microsoft,
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.160]   a lot of the Fang, Magnificent 7.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.120]   So I guess, Chamath, let's just start with you.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.840]   Has the soft landing been secure?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.000]   - I mean, it's pretty incredible, actually,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   but it looks like there's a really good chance that it has.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.760]   I think the bigger question, though,
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.120]   is if we are on the verge of a real contraction
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.040]   in the economy.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   And I think there's been enough people that have warned,
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.160]   you have to remember, like, even though the stock market
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.360]   for seven companies is hitting all-time highs,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.640]   the stock market for every other company
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.560]   that isn't those seven companies have not.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.240]   And that really is about just the broad-based demand
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.080]   of the economy.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.720]   So yeah, I think that inflation is contracting,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.960]   but it could be contracting for a combination of reasons.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.280]   One is because we have had high rates for a long time,
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.760]   but the other part is now people aren't employed,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.360]   there is no money, and the question is whether you have
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.440]   some sort of contraction economically
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.120]   that is measured by a recession or not.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.400]   I think that's a really big question.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.320]   What happens in the next couple quarters?
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.520]   Do we have a little mini-recession or not?
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.680]   - Okay, Freeberg, your thoughts,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.200]   and then we'll go to Sax.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.800]   - I think the market's priced in a lot
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.640]   of the expectation already.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.960]   If you look at the PE chart on the S&P 500,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.600]   going back five years, let's pull this one up real quick.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.360]   You can see that we peaked out, obviously, in 2020, 2021,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.920]   where we had a big boom with all the stimulus money
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.040]   coming in and all the money found its way into the markets
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.320]   during the end of the ZURP era.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.120]   And then there was the slow wind down
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.360]   as we started to hike rates.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.480]   And then rate hikes peaked.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.600]   And now, despite the fact that rate hikes have stopped
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.240]   and there have been conversations
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.680]   about when the reversal will happen,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.720]   the market's already started to price in that reversal.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.520]   So with respect to market valuations,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.720]   we have still seen a rather significant increase
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   in the PE ratio across the S&P 500.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.200]   Now, to Chamath's point, a large percentage of that
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.040]   is contributed to by the top seven tech companies
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.840]   that are driving that ratio inflation.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.680]   But a lot of the market makers
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.520]   have already started to take action,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.560]   expecting the rate cuts to come in.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.280]   As you point out, Jekyll, 90% plus likelihood
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.240]   of rate cuts happening this year.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.720]   So I don't know how much market action we will see,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.800]   but there has been a lot of conversation from D.C.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.520]   about the Fed should reset expectations on inflation
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.680]   from two to 3%.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.640]   And if they did that, that becomes the new normal.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.200]   And we're never gonna get back to 2%,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.680]   at least in this current kind of era.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.080]   That might be the era that we start,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.920]   the level that we start to cut.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.480]   - Oh, really, people are talking about that?
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.920]   Talking about that, Freeberg, of that, like...
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.040]   - That's been a big push. - Interesting.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.600]   - The Jerome Powell mandate of 2% inflation
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.880]   may be an expectation that cannot be met
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.960]   given the amount of stimulus that went into the economy
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.760]   during COVID, that it could take a decade
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.040]   to earn its way out.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.840]   As a result, we will not see a normalized contraction
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.400]   of that capital coming out of the markets
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.280]   in a way that will get us back down to 2% inflation
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.440]   for the time being.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.920]   And I just saw a presentation
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.600]   by a bunch of food company executives recently,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.880]   and they took 13 to 15% price hikes last year.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.000]   And you've heard Elizabeth Warren
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.960]   kind of chime on about this.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.160]   But the reality is that inflation is not just in the U.S.,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.080]   but around the world,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.840]   and it affects the U.S. markets as well,
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.520]   because a lot of U.S. companies have had to raise prices
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.600]   because of their dependence on labor and materials
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.560]   and commodities from other countries that are inflating.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.200]   - They call this the inputs, right?
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.280]   This is what they say, the inputs.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.680]   - Exactly, and because of the way
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.720]   that the globalized economy works today,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.880]   the inflation around the world
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   is gonna continue to buoy inflation in the U.S.,
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.720]   even if we get our house in order.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   So it's very unlikely that we get back to a two-handle,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   at least in this kind of era.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.280]   And as a result, you'll probably see
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.720]   the market kind of assume
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.120]   that we're gonna be at a 3% kind of inflation level
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.720]   for quite some time.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.400]   - It's very interesting, the obsession with the two.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.080]   I brought this up on the show.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.280]   The 2% handle and this target
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.240]   came from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's guy,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.360]   Roger Douglas, Minister of Finance,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.200]   and he came up with it because they just asked him,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.360]   like, "Well, what's a healthy one?"
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.840]   And he came up with that, and then everybody adopted it.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.880]   - The Dunder Mifflin Inflation Index.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.000]   - Basically, it's just sitting out there.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.600]   Okay, so for a completely objective, nonpartisan view
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.720]   of all this incredible economic data,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.320]   we go to our RNC correspondent, David Sachs.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.600]   Throw a wet blanket on this incredible news.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.640]   - I'm as nonpartisan as you are, Jay Cow.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.480]   - Exactly.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.600]   - Don't pretend like you're not a candidate in this race.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.000]   - I am a moderate independent, as we all know,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.800]   from my Fox News hits.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.640]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.120]   Fox News has hired you to provide
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.680]   the opposite point of view.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.360]   In any event, sorry, what's your question?
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.600]   - Just going down the middle here.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.840]   Joking, obviously, but a little bit.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.480]   But this is just, rate the Fed's reaction to this.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.680]   It seems like the Fed's supposed to be independent.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.720]   Obviously, this Fed chair has worked
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.800]   across an administration.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.640]   So, we've said here very critically,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.840]   they got started too late.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.880]   They should have got ahead of this.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.680]   But, I mean, rate their performance since then.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.720]   Do you think they're nailing this
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.840]   and there's gonna be a soft landing?
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840]   What, you have concerns?
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.760]   You're optimistic about the economy
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.040]   and how they've handled it?
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.960]   - Well, the Fed's mistake was just waiting way too long
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.480]   to react to the inflation.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.200]   And they didn't just wait nine months
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.880]   after the first inflation print came in
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.120]   that was too high before they started raising rates.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.280]   They continued QE for six more months.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.120]   So, when you talk about all this stimulus
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.240]   that's still in the economy
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   that they can't seem to get rid of,
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.720]   a lot of that was created by the Fed's QE
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.640]   in the second half of 2021.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.960]   That should never have happened.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.520]   Since then, they did what they had to do,
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.120]   which is they increased rates to solve inflation.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.360]   That's what you do.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   And yes, it does seem to be working,
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.160]   but we still have inflation
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.240]   being persistently high at 3%.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.600]   And so now, like Friedberg's saying,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.920]   they're trying to change the goalpost
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.880]   to somehow normalize 3%.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.480]   We should just understand that what that means
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.320]   is permanently higher interest rates
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.960]   because the Fed has to offer,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.000]   or under normal circumstances,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.680]   has to offer a return above the rate of inflation.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.960]   So, whatever that return is, 1%, 2%,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.280]   you stack that on top of the inflation rate.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.480]   So, in other words,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.440]   let's say the Fed wanted to target a 2% real return.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.080]   That means that the interest rate would be 5%
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.920]   with a 3% rate of inflation.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.000]   Whereas if inflation can be managed down to 2%,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.640]   you would have a 4% interest rate.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.200]   And that persistently,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.720]   if we're talking permanently higher interest rate,
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.560]   will create a drag on the economy
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.240]   because lower interest rates create more investment.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.760]   They reduce the hurdle rates to take risk,
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.960]   whereas higher interest rates, as we've seen,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.680]   create drag on equities and drag on investment.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.880]   So, if they redefine the inflation rate to 3 instead of 2,
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.880]   there will be long-term consequences from that.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.800]   That is not a free thing to do.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.640]   - Yeah.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.480]   - So, that would be one part of the answer.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.200]   The other thing is just, yeah, look,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.000]   inflation going from 3.1 to 3.0 is positive.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.280]   It's good news.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.000]   Better than it going from 3.1 to 3.2.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.720]   But we're talking about 0.1%.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.600]   And I just think people get a little too excited
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.160]   reading into these prints
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.400]   when these are not huge changes in numbers.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.200]   I do think that once the inflation rate
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.080]   starts with a two-handle,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.600]   that psychologically, I think,
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.240]   will be a big change for people.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.720]   - Psychology has so much to do with this.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.520]   I thought, I was doing a little research on it,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   why it's so contentious
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.080]   and there's so much of a lack of consensus about it.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.920]   Nick, pull up this chart.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.600]   I wanted to share it with you guys.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.720]   This is basically a psychological phenomenon
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.080]   called partisan economic perception.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.360]   And this has been studied for some time.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.800]   And what's really interesting about it is
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.640]   it shows what percentage of people
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.880]   who are Democrats and Republicans
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.400]   here in the United States of America
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.880]   say the economy's good.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.200]   And if you look at Clinton,
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.800]   and he got to be president at the helm
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.640]   during the internet revolution
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.320]   and this incredible economic boom,
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.960]   he was obviously so centrist, right?
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.480]   He appealed to both sides of the aisle.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.560]   And you had this very tight consensus
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.440]   that the economy was good.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.840]   Democrats were maybe three or four percentage points
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.160]   above Republicans in that perception.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   And then Bush came in and all of a sudden,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.400]   Democrats hated Bush so much
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.080]   that they perceived the same economy,
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   2000, and you obviously have the dot-com bust there.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.360]   So they both went down in unison,
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.840]   especially after the great recession.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.120]   But you have this disparity that comes up, Chamath,
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.480]   where you have 25 points between how they perceive it.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.760]   Obama, obviously, Democrats were incredibly enthusiastic
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.440]   about Obama, effusive even,
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.480]   but Republicans hated him with a passion, right?
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.840]   And that was really when Fox News started to get cooking.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.680]   And then you look at Trump, same exact phenomenon.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.160]   It flips.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.640]   Under Trump, 80% of Republicans think,
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.960]   "Oh, the economy is good."
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.440]   And then Democrats say, "It's not good."
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.440]   And that plummets and you get this big dispersion.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.240]   There are two moments in time, Freiburg, where,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.400]   or three, when you start to see the consensus get tighter,
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.360]   and that's during a crash.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.120]   So there's your dot-com crash, great financial crisis,
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.560]   and an election, yeah, and a great,
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.080]   that's a very good point, actually, I didn't notice that,
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.680]   and then also during the pandemic.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.520]   So you have three crises.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.040]   - Yeah, this is a great chart, yeah.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.120]   - So, Freiburg, looking at this,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.960]   I think it explains so much of the tension in the country
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.560]   that we can't even agree on,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.640]   hey, is the economy good?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.440]   It's just everything is perceived
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.240]   through your partisan lens.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.200]   What's your takeaway from this?
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.160]   Is it that we just don't run moderates anymore like Clinton?
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.040]   - Well, look, I mean, at the end of the day,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   if people feel like they're progressing, they feel happier.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.960]   They feel like they're not progressing, they're unhappy,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.880]   regardless of their absolute state.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.080]   You know, we talked about this with Jonathan Haidt
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.920]   on our interview show.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.520]   We talked about this on the show in the past.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.040]   I think that there's some studies that show
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   that if income growth is not roughly 10% a year,
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.240]   you get an unhappiness indicator,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   and then there are other associations with that,
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.040]   like am I improving the size of my house?
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.160]   Am I able to buy a new car?
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.440]   Am I able to progress in my career and make more money?
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.000]   All these factors kind of play in,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.840]   and much of this ends up being buoyed
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.880]   by the political ideology of the candidate
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.200]   that's in the office and how they are popularizing
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.200]   what they are doing to help you progress,
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.880]   even if you are or are not actually progressing.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.160]   So then people hear the political leadership say,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.040]   "This is what we're doing."
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.480]   You associate that as being positive or negative.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.000]   If you're a Republican or you're a Democrat,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.920]   you associate it as one or the other.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.400]   And so you have this perception of progression
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.840]   without actually having economic progression be tied to it.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.720]   So the reality gets decoupled.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.920]   So I think it's an excellent chart
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.240]   to kind of highlight that fact.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.640]   I'm not sure how much it ties to this inflationary issue
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.120]   that we're dealing with right now,
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.360]   but I will tell you that, and I'll restate this again,
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.320]   much of the inflation,
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.520]   like I think grocery prices are up 30 plus percent.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.120]   Nick, you could probably pull this up since COVID.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.960]   - That is, you're correct, one of the sticky points.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.120]   You know, 'cause this CPI,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.360]   you have to parse it like you're saying in grocery.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.760]   - Yeah, the more globalized the businesses are
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.160]   that are providing the goods or services to us,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.640]   the more likely they are to need to hike prices
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.240]   to make up for the inflationary cost structure
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.720]   in their business because of their global presence.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.040]   - You wanna hear an interesting factoid?
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.360]   - Yes, please.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.080]   - There was an article in Bloomberg, I sent it to Nick,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.160]   but people have been tracking the S&P 500 index
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.000]   versus the equal weighted index.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.360]   So when you calculate the S&P 500 index,
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.520]   you weight it for the market cap.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.360]   So the top seven or eight companies
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.640]   obviously get a lot more weight in it.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.000]   And so they look at the spread between that index
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.840]   and an equal weighted index where every 500 companies are,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.800]   you know, the 500 companies are each equal.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.560]   And what's interesting is the spread right now
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.520]   is the most extreme since March of 2000
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.960]   right before the dot-com crash.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.920]   - Oh, Jesus Christ, thanks, Chamath.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.640]   - Well, this is Bloomberg's data, so I'm just repeating it.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.400]   I read that article, but--
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.280]   - That's incredible.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.520]   - It's a tie-in to the AI thing, I guess,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.160]   that we're gonna talk about soon, but--
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.480]   - Next, yeah.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.200]   - We could be at the end of just an enormous hype cycle here
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.800]   where we have to contract the equity market.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.640]   That's probably not a bad thing, by the way,
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.160]   because as Zak said,
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.360]   one of the things that you have to do
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.920]   is I think you have to underwrite to a rate of return.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.400]   And right now, nobody knows really what to do
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.000]   because valuations would tell you
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.160]   that you should price to the low end,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.280]   but then it's not really clear
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.520]   what the risk-free rate of return should be.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.400]   So everybody's just sort of like they're shrugging
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.960]   and their arms are in the air, and nobody knows what to do.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.080]   So if you really wanna get the economy moving at some point,
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.640]   you're gonna have to reset something.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.840]   You're gonna have to reset rates,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.960]   or you're gonna have to set the equity risk premium
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.080]   in the stock market.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.240]   You're gonna have to reset people's expectations
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.640]   around what is actually happening in the economy.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.080]   And right now, we're in this limbo
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.160]   where none of those things have been decided.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.320]   But there are all of these weird moments,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.480]   like data points that you could use
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.720]   to kind of just justify your bias, quite honestly.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.800]   But the point is that I think
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.480]   there's a lot of question marks right now,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.040]   not a lot of answers.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.640]   - Yeah, that phenomenon you were talking about previously
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.680]   is relative deprivation, Freeberg.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.760]   It's the phenomenon where you compare yourself
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.820]   to other people and you feel like I'm getting screwed here.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.040]   Sax, what's your take on this AI bubble?
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.560]   'Cause I got some data I'm about to pull up on it,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.160]   but let's just get there right now.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.160]   How much of this boom that we're seeing in the stock market
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.600]   is this AI bubble?
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.440]   - Well, a lot of the boom is driven by these AI stocks,
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.520]   notably NVIDIA.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.560]   I mean, if you take out the AI stocks,
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.560]   I'm not sure the market is up,
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.760]   or maybe it's up a little bit.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.160]   I mean, a huge part of the gain is from these,
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.280]   I don't know, top five, top seven tech stocks.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.480]   Is it a bubble?
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.200]   I think that's going a little too far.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.700]   I mean, I personally think the AI wave is real.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.240]   I think the question is whether the level of investment
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.640]   that we're seeing going into cloud service infrastructure
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.960]   is sustainable.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.680]   There's a huge build out happening right now,
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.240]   many, many billions of dollars building out
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   these new cloud service centers or cloud infrastructure.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.160]   - Data centers.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.240]   - Data centers based on GPUs instead of CPUs.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.600]   And I think it's a good question
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.240]   about whether that's sustainable.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.680]   I do think that one of the things that's going on
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.160]   is that the chips are really expensive.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.640]   I mean, these GPUs from NVIDIA,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.360]   what, they're like $30,000?
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.200]   - Yeah.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.520]   - Per GPU? - For an H100, yeah.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.960]   - Right, and part of the reason for that is the scarcity.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.280]   They haven't been able to produce
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.040]   as much as there's demand for,
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.120]   and so they're commanding a premium right now.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.880]   - And just to be clear, they're not just a chip.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.960]   I mean, people think they're like a chip.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.280]   They think something you hold in the palm of your hand.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.080]   They're like a racked server that's like 50 pounds.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.680]   - Yeah, it's got like thousands of components,
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.160]   and it's a very complicated product to make.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.640]   In any event, they're very expensive,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.280]   and so it's very expensive
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.720]   to build out this new infrastructure.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.280]   I do think that over time,
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.000]   the price of these chips just has to come down.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.240]   It just doesn't make sense that they'd be so expensive.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.680]   Just as production increases
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.640]   and they don't have this rate limit on the supply,
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.240]   then I think the price should come down
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.920]   and the cost of this infrastructure should normalize a bit.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.000]   - Well, and you heard it here first on the "All In" pod.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.400]   Here's episode 181, six weeks ago.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.440]   Noshvrakhanis wasn't involved in this one,
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.800]   but here's Chamath and Freeberg.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.520]   - You cannot spend this kind of money
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.000]   and show no incremental revenue potential.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.760]   So while this is incredible for NVIDIA,
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.560]   the chicken is coming home to roost
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.280]   because if you do not start seeing revenue flow
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.760]   to the bottom line of these companies
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.640]   that are spending $26 billion a quarter,
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.960]   the market cap of NVIDIA
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.120]   is not what the market cap of NVIDIA should be.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.880]   And all of these other companies are going to get punished
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.160]   for spending this kind of money.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.360]   Where are all these newfangled things
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.280]   that we're supposed to see
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.200]   that justifies $100 billion of chip spend a year,
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.760]   $200 billion of energy spend,
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.000]   $100 billion of all this other stuff?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.720]   We're now spending $750 billion.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   This is on the order of a national transfer payment.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.960]   And we've seen nothing to show for it
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.560]   except that you can mimic somebody's voice.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.840]   It doesn't all hang together yet.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   - You know, the general statement might be made
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.480]   that perhaps the first AI mini bubble is bursting a bit,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.400]   and particularly with respect
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.680]   to the accelerated expectations
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.280]   that public market investors had
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.480]   for public market technology stocks,
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.200]   that perhaps now is the time for a bit of a reckoning,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.480]   that perhaps this isn't going to happen
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.920]   at the same margin level
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.600]   or the pace that folks had modeled.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.440]   - Correct.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.840]   - And this is going to cause a bit of a setback.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.280]   And so I think inspired in part by that,
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.000]   David Kahn from Sequoia Capital,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.520]   legendary venture firm here in Silicon Valley,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.240]   published a blog titled "AI $600 Billion Question."
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.160]   Kahn said there was a $500 billion revenue hole
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.840]   when considering AI CapEx levels.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.240]   He got this number by calculating
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.600]   that companies need to show around $600 billion
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.840]   in AI revenue to justify projected CapEx levels in Q4.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.440]   And he generally assumes
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.480]   Google, Microsoft, Apple, MetaTesla, and others
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.240]   will generate $100 billion annually combined.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.440]   That's pretty generous,
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.640]   and that still leaves a $500 billion hole.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.680]   Here's the NVIDIA data center run rate revenue,
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.200]   as you can see, Q4 of 2023, $50 billion,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.760]   and now $150 billion.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.120]   And then you have the data center facilities being built
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.320]   and the cost to operate those,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.640]   implied data center AI spend,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.400]   and then of course your software margin.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   Kahn said he also thinks that the GPU shortage
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.360]   already peaked last year.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.120]   We'll get to that later.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.200]   On June 25th, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.640]   Goldman published a 31-page report
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.760]   called "Gen AI, Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit."
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.200]   So you heard it here first on the All-In Pod,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.800]   and I think everybody's kind of catching up with this theme.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.360]   Companies are gonna spend $1 trillion,
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.680]   according to the report, on AI CapEx
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.640]   over the next several years.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.120]   Usually that's three to five,
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.200]   and we use the word several.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.760]   AI productivity gains are limited
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.800]   in the near to midterm, the next 10 years,
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.160]   and AI's ROI is likely significantly limited due to costs.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.640]   The costs of AI are so high,
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.960]   and the revenue is so unclear,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.480]   there's a chance the economics never make sense.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.320]   Here's a choice quote,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.400]   and then I'll get the reaction from the team.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.680]   "Replacing low-wage jobs
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.240]   "with tremendously costly technology
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.840]   "is basically the polar opposite
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.160]   "of the prior technology transitions
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.560]   "I've witnessed in my 30 years
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.120]   "of closely following the tech industry."
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.560]   And that's Goldman's head of global equity research.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.240]   It's an interesting concept here, Chamath,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.080]   that you're saying, like,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.520]   hey, you're making fun images
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.160]   or maybe rewriting your blog post,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.960]   but that's low-wage work.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.000]   So what are your thoughts on this report,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.080]   these two reports here?
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.120]   - Well, I think we're all converging
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.440]   on the same realization,
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.120]   which is you can't spend a trillion dollars
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.640]   and only have toy apps to show for it.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.160]   So I think we've all been amazed
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.920]   by these AI demos.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.960]   I think the four of us have talked
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.520]   pretty incessantly about it now
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   for 18-plus months,
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.600]   ever since we saw the first open AI demos.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.640]   So that's great.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.400]   And the underlying technology, I think,
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.960]   is really important.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   But it's also important to acknowledge
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.400]   that the underlying technology has enormous gaps.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.040]   There's gaps in the quality
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.640]   of the products that can be created
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.000]   to not have hallucinations.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.440]   Those gaps are too large right now
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.160]   for them to be used reliably
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.440]   in production settings,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.520]   unless you have a very defined scope.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.040]   If you have a defined scope, though,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.440]   the implementation costs are not nearly
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.680]   what needs the level of spend to support.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.200]   So there's just a big mismatch.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.720]   Second is that we have a huge problem
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.560]   with NVIDIA,
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.280]   and I'll just kind of say the quiet part out loud,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.920]   which is you can't spend this kind of money
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.680]   to have technology lock-in to one hardware vendor.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.120]   And that makes no sense.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.280]   And what you're seeing now is that Amazon,
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.440]   Google, Microsoft, AMD, Intel,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.440]   a plethora of startups, Grok,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.160]   everybody trying to make now
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.400]   different hardware solutions.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.640]   The problem, though, that that creates
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.720]   is that we have this massive lock-in right now
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.640]   because the code is littered
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.080]   with all these NVIDIA-specific ways
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.960]   of implementing access to GPUs.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   That's not sustainable.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.280]   So we're in a bit of an existential thrash,
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.560]   and I think the only way
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.880]   that we're gonna get around this
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.400]   is to do a little bit of a reset.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.560]   And I think that's gonna touch a lot of startups
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.960]   that have already taken down way too much money
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   at really insane valuations.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.320]   Part of that was just because we needed,
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.200]   I guess the market wanted a place to believe in again
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.480]   after the crypto meltdown
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.760]   and after all of the other SaaS meltdown
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.280]   and all of the other stuff that we've gone through.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.520]   So yeah, I think that we are
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.720]   in a bit of a reckoning right now.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.600]   It's going to be a complicated couple of quarters
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.400]   at a minimum and probably a complicated year
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.600]   to sort out who's actually real.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.400]   - It's an interesting psychological phenomenon
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.480]   there, Friedberg, of the capital alligators,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.720]   the tech industry, the entrepreneurs,
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.360]   they want to believe in something,
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.600]   and the previous paradigm shifts were ending,
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.680]   and here we go, a new paradigm shift.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.640]   Perhaps we're such a efficient capitalistic machine now
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.920]   that we almost like process stuff super quickly
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.400]   in some ways, Friedberg.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.800]   You know, we deploy massive capital,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.160]   we try to solve huge problems, I mean,
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.120]   and then maybe we hit the reckoning
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.080]   and the trowel of despair that we talked about,
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.120]   you know, many times, innovators' dilemma,
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.360]   you know, crossing the chasm kind of style.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.880]   So what are your thoughts on Shamat's point there
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.160]   or any other points you might have?
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.080]   - There's a cold hard truth here,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.760]   which is there is a ton of capital
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.680]   that was raised during the COVID bubble era
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.560]   and the Zerp era that needed a place to go,
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.480]   and a lot of the traditional businesses,
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.480]   traditional business models,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.280]   traditional in the technology sense,
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.720]   SAS and a lot of the biotech stuff,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.520]   it all became-- - Apps.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.920]   - It became uninvestable.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.720]   Then there's a lot of money in the public markets
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.080]   that was sitting on the sidelines,
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.920]   that was sitting in treasuries and so on.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.880]   So every dollar is looking for growth
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.800]   and there's a lot of dollars still sitting around out there
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.240]   from the Zerp era
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.800]   and coming into this kind of post-Zerp era,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.240]   looking for a place for growth.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.520]   And there is very little growth,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.640]   as we talked about with the S&P 493,
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.040]   not being very performative
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.040]   with respect to growth and revenue
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.800]   and having great outlook for the next five years.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.880]   So then when there is a glimmer of upside,
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.640]   there's a glimmer of opportunity,
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.320]   even if it's just painting a picture of a growth story,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.800]   all the capital drives into it.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.480]   And we've all heard stories
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.200]   about these Series A startups in AI
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.040]   getting bid up to $100 million valuation.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.480]   And I've seen a couple of these
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.560]   where people have pitched me things
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.360]   on like protein modeling AI startups.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.240]   And it's literally like two guys from Meta and OpenAI
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.360]   that left and started this company
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.960]   and they raised 30 on a 120 pre or something.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.360]   And it's just two guys building a model.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.400]   And that's because that capital needs to find a place
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.640]   where it can tell itself a growth story.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.360]   And so I think that we're still dealing
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.760]   with the capital hangover from ZURP
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.520]   and the fact that there's a dearth of areas
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.200]   to invest for real growth
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.640]   that has allowed the AI bubble
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.080]   to kind of grow as quickly as it has.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.680]   And now, as Chamath points out,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.880]   we are kind of rationalizing that back.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.440]   And I do think that there's gonna be a reset.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.760]   Now, I'll also say that the Goldman report,
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.720]   which I read and some of the other analyses
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.240]   that have been done,
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.720]   I think there was some commentary or some analysis that,
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.400]   hey, it costs me six times as much
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.280]   as having an analyst do this work.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.600]   Like the energy cost of the AI is still so high,
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.400]   the actual performance of the model is not good.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.840]   But what that fails to, it's right and wrong.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.160]   It's right in the sense that, yes,
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.680]   it is more expensive today
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.000]   and the return on investment is not there today.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.440]   It's wrong in that it ignores
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.120]   the performative model improvements that we're seeing
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.880]   in nearly any metric over the past couple of months.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.440]   Every few months, as we know,
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.240]   we see new models, new improvements, new architectures,
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.080]   new ways of leveraging the chips
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.280]   to actually drive a lower token cost,
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.000]   to drive lower energy cost per answer,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.600]   lower energy cost per run.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.240]   And so every metric that matters is improving.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.200]   So if you fast forward another 24, 36 months,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.920]   I do think that there's a great reason to be optimistic
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.080]   that there's gonna be extraordinary ROI
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.000]   based on the infrastructure that's being built.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.560]   It's a question of, are you gonna get payback
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.040]   before the next cycle of infrastructure needs to be made
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.000]   and everything comes back in?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.680]   We saw this during the dot-com boom
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.240]   where a lot of people built out data centers
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.600]   and by the time they were actually able
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.160]   to make money on those data centers,
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.680]   it was like, hey, all the new telco equipment,
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.240]   all the new servers need to be put in
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.640]   and everything got written off.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.920]   So there is a big CapEx kind of question mark here,
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.880]   but I do think that the fundamental economics of AI
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.600]   will be proven over the next couple of quarters.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's going to be
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.360]   the next couple of quarters, quite honestly.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.840]   I do think in the next couple of decades
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.320]   and in the next couple of years,
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.840]   what I would hope ambitiously
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   is that there are a few really useful proof points
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.880]   where companies are making revenue,
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.920]   solving very specific defined problems,
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.000]   where quite honestly, you're taking workloads of X
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.400]   and making it X over 10, right?
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.800]   And I think that that's possible,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.360]   but I think this generalized idea
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.560]   that all of this spend is gonna have a good ROI,
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.240]   I think is pretty wishful thinking.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.600]   - Sach, you wanna maybe give us your thoughts here?
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.120]   Bubble, do we work our way out of it?
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.800]   Are we overspending or is this all manifest destiny?
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.680]   You know, if you build it, they will come kind of situation.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.320]   We throw all this capital there.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.680]   We make a lot of progress on these projects
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.760]   and something comes out the other end as messy as it is.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.200]   - I think that's what's likely to happen.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.680]   I'm much more bullish than you guys
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.960]   about this investment that's being made.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.000]   Remember that when the internet got started in the '90s,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.920]   it was via dial-up.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.640]   I mean, you literally had to have a modem
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.400]   and you would dial up the internet
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.960]   and it was incredibly slow.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.400]   Photo sharing didn't even work,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.040]   so social networking wasn't possible.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.480]   And basically what happened next
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.320]   was that the telecom companies spent a ton of money
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.720]   building out broadband
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.920]   and people started upgrading to broadband.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.000]   Then we had the dot-com crash.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.320]   Everyone thought that the telecom companies
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.360]   had wasted billions of dollars
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.280]   investing in all this broadband infrastructure
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.720]   and it turned out that no, they were right to do that.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.920]   It just took a while for that to get used.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.560]   And this is a pretty common pattern
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.200]   with technological revolutions
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.640]   is that you can have a bubble in the short term
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.280]   but then it gets justified in the mid to long term.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.960]   The build out of the railroads in the United States,
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.800]   another example of this.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.840]   We had huge railroad bubbles
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.600]   but it turned out that that investment was all worthwhile.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.680]   So I tend to think that's what's gonna happen with AI.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.720]   I mean, I do think that there's already enough,
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.520]   let's call it realness, to the applications.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.760]   I mean, I'll give you three examples.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.560]   Number one, open AI.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.800]   I mean, open AI is effectively semantic search, right?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.200]   It's a different kind of search engine
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.120]   where it understands the question you're asking
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.600]   and gives you an answer instead of blue links.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.280]   And they're already at, what was it?
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.440]   We talked about this previously.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.040]   3.4 billion in revenue.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.760]   - Now that's consumer at 20 bucks
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.160]   and enterprise at like 30 bucks a month.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.080]   And then there's also the API.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.480]   - Yeah, they're just starting already.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.560]   I mean, this company has only been around for two years
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.080]   with a product on the market
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.480]   and it's doubling year over year.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.880]   So that's just example number one, right?
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.560]   I mean, what's the most valuable application
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.920]   on the internet until now?
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.880]   It's been Google, right?
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.920]   And so-- - Search.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.760]   - Search.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.560]   And so you have a different kind of search now
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.400]   that I'm not saying it's a one-for-one replacement.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.520]   It's also a new market.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.600]   But my point is just you already have
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   a very powerful application
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.080]   in the form of this semantic search,
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.040]   which open AI is currently dominating.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.480]   The second one, I think, will be when Apple comes out
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   with the iPhone 16 with LLM-powered Siri,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   assuming they do a decent job with that,
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.560]   it's gonna lead to a huge upgrade cycle.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.960]   I mean, I'm still on an iPhone 13
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.520]   because I haven't seen a reason to upgrade.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.640]   I will definitely upgrade to the iPhone 16.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.560]   - Yeah, snap upgrade.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.400]   Snap upgrade.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.440]   - Snap upgrade for that,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.160]   assuming that they roll their own LLM
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.320]   and use that to power Siri
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.240]   and don't give my data to a third-party LLM.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.120]   And there's been mixed reports about that.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.480]   - You don't trust Sam Altman with your iPhone backup?
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.800]   - I don't want Apple sharing any of my data,
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.000]   which they obtained by being the operating system
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.760]   with a third-party LLM.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.320]   But a bunch of viewers of the show
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.560]   posted in the comments that I had made a mistake on this
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.760]   and that Apple was rolling its own LLM to power Siri
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.960]   and they would only go to open AI
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   if their own LLM can't do it for some reason.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.200]   I'm just gonna turn that feature off.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.000]   But in any event, so assuming Apple gets that right,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.760]   everyone's gonna upgrade their iPhones.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.360]   The third app is, look,
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.520]   we're using LLMs to power Glue
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.200]   and the results aren't always consistently awesome.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.000]   I would say the results are kind of like a B+ right now,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.560]   but you do get some really great results.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.320]   - B+ is a strong start for YouTube.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.160]   - It's a strong start.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.920]   - And in a year or so,
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.920]   we're gonna be at the next-gen version of all the models.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.080]   You're gonna be at, I'm sure,
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.680]   Chat GPT 5 will be out
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.520]   and then the next version of Clawed and so forth.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.800]   At that point, it's gonna be an A+.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.160]   - I gotta tell you, I've been using Clawed and Chat GPT 4.0
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.120]   and it is extraordinary how fast they've fixed
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.800]   going to the web to get information.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   It used to be arduous and painful
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   to get updated information.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.160]   And so I was like, "Hey, get me all of these."
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.640]   I think I may have told this story previously here
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.480]   on This Week in Startups,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.280]   but I was talking about like I was doing research
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.400]   on salaries.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.680]   And I said, "Just grant me all the information
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.320]   "from Glassdoor, Indeed, high salary, low salary,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.400]   "average salary, these two different cities,
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.680]   "put it in a table and give me the links."
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.720]   And it did it.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   And I was like, "That's like a college-educated person's job
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.080]   "for 40 bucks an hour, call it, whatever it is,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.000]   "a 60, 70, $80,000 a year person."
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.760]   So I'm in the bullish gap with you, Sax.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.960]   I think it's being overbuilt, sure,
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.320]   but I think we're gonna see a tipping point next year
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.960]   where a lot of labor arbitrage occurs.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.840]   And what I mean by that is like,
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.400]   people are figuring out ways to cut jobs
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.040]   or have one person do three jobs.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.720]   And I'm seeing it across all the startups we invest in.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.560]   I'm seeing it with Athena,
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.920]   the company we invested in, I mentioned earlier.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:13.200]   And I'm really interested in robotics now too.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.840]   I think there's gonna be some incredible gains
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.360]   with Optimus and some of the other robots that are occurring
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.000]   and those things are only gonna cost 20 grand.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.480]   So this is gonna be pretty amazing.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.600]   - Yeah, look, I think the low-hanging fruit application-wise
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.240]   in the enterprise is chat with a knowledge base,
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.600]   chat with your knowledge bases.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.320]   That's what people want, right?
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.600]   And we're still in the early stages
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.840]   of being able to connect your enterprise data
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.040]   to an LLM in a safe, compliant way.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.680]   That's where a lot of activity is happening right now.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.240]   - And the compliant part means
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   you're working in the tech group or the marketing group
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.640]   and you don't search the HR department's data.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.320]   - Guys, let me ask you just a general question though.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   Like we've spent a trillion dollars.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.960]   Let's say that there's four purchasing commits for,
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.800]   let's be generous and say only half that number.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.520]   So now there's 1.5 trillion.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.840]   So we're $1.5 trillion in the J-curve.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.720]   How much total revenue does the entire AI economy
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.080]   that's established today need to generate
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.600]   to pay that back plus some reasonable rate of return?
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.760]   Revenue at a fair multiple.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.920]   And I think what I'm getting to is
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.400]   open AI is a good example of a company that's winning,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.840]   but unless they somehow figure out a way
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.800]   to start making $50 billion,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.000]   there's another $47 billion of revenue that's missing.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.160]   That's my point.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.240]   - Yeah, I think they get there.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.080]   I'm totally honest.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.840]   And watching-- - No, no, no, I'm saying,
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.160]   I'm just saying that's like
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.000]   just for the last couple of years I spent.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.840]   - Yeah.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.520]   I mean, there's so much dry powder sitting around
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.800]   at these large companies.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.160]   I think capital is a weapon kind of situation,
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.800]   but it could be a big--
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.960]   - That's a different explanation,
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.360]   which is we can just take the rate of return to zero
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.800]   'cause we have nothing better to do with the money.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.160]   That's a fair answer as well, Jason.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.000]   - Yeah, I mean, what are they gonna do?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.040]   Give a dividend?
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.600]   I mean, God forbid, right?
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.520]   Like, I mean, Facebook started giving one,
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.400]   Apple's given one, so maybe, you know,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.880]   I think that's how, and they can't do M&A
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.200]   because of Alina Khan.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.760]   - Yeah, look, where I think Shamath has a point
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.680]   is that these big tech companies
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.200]   are not building out all this infrastructure
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.080]   because they've modeled out the ROI
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.320]   and it's extremely positive.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.560]   They're doing it because it's an arms race.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.880]   It's so strategic right now to have these AI capabilities
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.160]   and to power the expected next generation of AI apps,
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.760]   they can't afford to let one of their competitors have that.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.120]   They have to compete.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   So they're all in an arms race with each other,
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.960]   bidding up the cost of these GPUs
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   because they have to have that supply.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.800]   - It's like nukes.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.640]   It's like nukes.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.480]   You never use them.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.300]   You built them out.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.140]   It might be the good comparison.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.320]   - Well, I mean, I think they're gonna use them,
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.480]   but yeah, I mean, the point is that
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.840]   it's a zero-sum game.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.480]   And if I let you have this GPU,
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.280]   I have one less GPU to use.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.760]   - What do you think of Andreessen,
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.240]   this article that Andreessen just turned on 20,000 GPUs?
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.120]   - Shamath, to your point,
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.280]   it was reported earlier this week
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.440]   that Andreessen Horowitz,
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.040]   that's a very large venture capital firm
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.320]   here in the Bay Area,
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.160]   is building a 20,000 GPU cluster.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.800]   We mentioned earlier, $20,000, $30,000 a GPU
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.880]   is what you can estimate there.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.640]   So this is hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.360]   to try to cut deals and win deals with AI startups.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   And so they stole this idea from Daniel Gross,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.960]   which you probably don't know who that is,
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.720]   but it's a company called Pioneer Labs
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.280]   and Nat Friedman from GitHub,
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.520]   they did this last year.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.360]   Same exact idea.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.840]   They acquired 2,500 H100s
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.040]   and they gave their portfolio companies access to it
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.280]   in something called the Andromeda cluster.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.920]   Really brilliant idea.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.960]   There's a tweet from Nat.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   It's not clear whether A16 is purchasing these
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.600]   or they're just gonna pay for them on AWS
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.280]   or Google Cloud or some other provider.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   But if these were purchased,
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.240]   obviously hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.520]   What's your thought here?
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.560]   I won't go through all the details.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.960]   I'll just go right to your opinion, Shamath.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.480]   What's your thought on this?
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.320]   - A friend of mine,
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.400]   who's a very successful debt fund manager,
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.880]   and I talked about it this week,
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.840]   friend of the pod,
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.880]   I won't name check him,
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.720]   but he knows who he is,
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.960]   and we're talking about this.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.080]   And basically, I think if you look at the most typical deal,
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.320]   so like, for example, the CoreWeave deal,
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.080]   which was floating around,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.200]   was something along the lines of 40% of the cost
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.040]   of all the GPUs was put up in cash
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.080]   and 60% was lent to CoreWeave by a whole group of bankers.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.240]   So assuming Andreessen was able to do roughly the same thing,
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.440]   the 20,000 GPU cluster, I'd call it,
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.400]   say 20 to 30,000 is between four and 600 million of cost.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.160]   And if they get 60% of it financed, I hope they did,
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.000]   that still leaves 40% that they would have had to pay for,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.280]   which you're still talking about $100 million plus.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.360]   And so then the real question is,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.920]   can they get enough equity back
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.760]   to make that $100 million investment worthwhile?
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.080]   And just to put a fine point on this,
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.360]   if that's 100 million of management fees,
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.680]   the reality is that that's actually $2 billion of value,
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.960]   right, because these management companies trade at,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.040]   call it, say 20 odd times.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.920]   So what's so interesting about this is like,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.720]   you take 100 million of management fee,
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.520]   that's worth 2 billion of enterprise value,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.280]   you dump it into these chips and cash.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.680]   So whatever equity you get from these startups
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.120]   will need to make about $2 billion plus a little bit
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.800]   to account for the time value of money.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.840]   Otherwise, you were probably better off not doing this.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.960]   That's just the math of it.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.800]   - I wonder if this is defensive--
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.160]   - Well, hold on, the 20 times math only makes sense
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.760]   if it's 100 million a year in perpetuity, right?
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.280]   If it's a one-time spend on the 100 million,
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   then it's just 100 million.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.680]   - Well, you also have to power these,
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.960]   you have to put them in a data center.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:47.800]   There's a lot of cost to these things.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.240]   - There's a lot of ongoing costs.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.880]   - Yeah, a lot of ongoing costs.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.640]   - Let's just say they'll spend then another 20 or 30 million
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.480]   over the next 10 years.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.160]   My point is, it's a drag on your enterprise value
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.680]   that's probably in the billion plus dollar range.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.840]   And so whatever equity you get
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.680]   needs to make up for that plus some.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.800]   And my only comment is that if you then factor in SAX,
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.160]   as you said before,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.160]   the desire to get these Nvidia chips down in price,
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.400]   but also to have hardware diversity,
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.160]   it's a really speculative bet.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.000]   And you have to be really right.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.840]   - It's also a crazy conflicted bet too,
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.920]   because Nvidia was using these chips in the same fashion.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.800]   They were using allocations
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.040]   to get investment allocations in companies
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:31.880]   and then paying them off.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.320]   So now you have Andreessen buying them from Nvidia.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.160]   It's also convoluted.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.120]   Amazon was doing this as well with AWS,
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.240]   giving credits, et cetera.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.320]   So tried and true strategy, but very strange.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.480]   - I don't think it's that weird a strategy.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.440]   Because, I mean, look, it's definitely different.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.280]   - I'm just saying it's weird
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.800]   because they're giving money to Nvidia.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.920]   - I don't think you need to do this
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.480]   to build a successful venture firm.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.040]   I mean, if you wanted to maximize the value of the entity,
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.760]   you would keep the 100 million for yourself
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.720]   because then some investor
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.160]   will pay you a huge multiple for that.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.200]   - I know what I'm saying is that they're buying these chips
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.160]   and then they're effectively timesharing them out
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.400]   to portfolio companies.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.160]   And so they're gonna charge for their use.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.200]   They're gonna amortize this cost.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   - They're gonna charge back,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.640]   you think they're gonna charge back the startups?
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.040]   - Yeah, yeah, no, I don't get it.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.440]   - I'm just saying, you have to see a path
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.720]   to make back what you're losing in enterprise value.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.560]   - I think this is brilliant for year zero, one, two,
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.240]   like Pioneer Labs was doing,
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.120]   because those people really don't have the money.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.720]   If you're a viable concern,
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.800]   you can easily get the money to buy your own
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.320]   or rent your own.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.760]   And we just said in the previous story
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.280]   that the glut and the weight is over for these.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.600]   So interesting.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.480]   - It depends on the rate of depreciation.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.440]   If you buy these chips at a premium
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.760]   because they're scarce right now,
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.600]   and then all of a sudden they rapidly depreciate in value,
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.680]   then you might lose money.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.560]   On the other hand,
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.880]   if the current value of the investment remains stable
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.480]   because they don't depreciate that rapidly,
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.360]   and then you can charge the cost back to the startups
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.680]   who are using the chips,
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.600]   then you break even.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.600]   - I think that's an excellent point.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.400]   - And it's basically a business development expense.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.880]   - I think that's an excellent point.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.800]   - This is a PR marketing exercise, and it worked.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.480]   Well done, Mark, 'cause we're talking about it.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.760]   - Yeah, I don't think this is a bad idea at all.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.360]   I mean, I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.560]   - I think they've gotten a hundred million
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.160]   in marketing of it just by--
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.000]   - Yeah, I mean, look,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.720]   it appeals to a certain category of startup
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.960]   who needs the GPUs.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   I mean, just to be clear,
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.960]   like there's lots of AI applications
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.840]   that don't need direct access to GPUs,
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.640]   because, you know, for example,
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.280]   we're using the cloud models
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.480]   and we're using the open AI models.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.960]   - And we're using the language model APIs,
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.400]   so it's abstract, we don't need them.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.360]   - Yeah, we don't deal with GPU.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.080]   I mean, you have to be in the model business effectively
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.200]   to need direct access to the GPUs.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.280]   - As we wrap up here today, Freeberg, your thoughts,
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.800]   and you had mentioned in the group chat
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.640]   last minute addition to the docket,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.360]   you wanted to talk about the French collections,
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.280]   and I know Sax was tweeting about it,
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.000]   because all the people who hate him were sending it to me.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.920]   So I always know when he tweets about something spicy.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.920]   Go ahead, Freeberg, what do you got?
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.760]   - There was effectively a center and left alignment
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   that created kind of a surprise upset to the right
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.400]   that was surging in the polls
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.560]   leading into this election in France.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.160]   And as we all saw, there was a lot of celebration
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.000]   in the streets and some rioting and so on,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.480]   but it was a real kind of surprise ship left
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.600]   in this kind of important vote that happened in France.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.200]   And then the party stepped up
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.080]   and put forward these economic proposals.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.840]   They said a 90% tax on income over 400,000 euro a year,
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.040]   a 14% mandatory wage increase,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.960]   retirement age needs to be reduced
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.640]   to the age of 60 from 64,
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.440]   which obviously massively increases social spending,
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.600]   and that they want to put forward proposals
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.560]   to put in place price controls on things like food,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.920]   electricity, gas, and petrol,
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.240]   so effectively intervening
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.120]   in kind of the free market pricing system.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.720]   Last month in India,
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.640]   we also saw elections where the BJP
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.880]   did not get a majority.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.200]   In Mexico, we saw Scheinbaum get elected
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.760]   with 60% of the vote,
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.800]   retaining the leftist government.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.520]   Scheinbaum's platform is that the government's role
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.760]   is to really solve the economic inequality
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.800]   kind of throughout the country.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.160]   She is a Jewish scientist
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.920]   who believes in technological progress,
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.360]   but her orientation is really around
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.680]   having institutions manage progress,
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.640]   not individuals in free markets.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.040]   We've seen this broad across other places.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.520]   In the UK, there was a big election in this past week,
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.920]   but I wanted to take a step back
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.320]   and just highlight
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.040]   that there is this kind of emerging tactical alliance
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.360]   that we've seen repeat a few times
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.520]   between the left and the center
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.800]   that pushes back against the right globally,
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.440]   but really what I think we're seeing
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.680]   is a much bigger shift
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.240]   where there's this bigger battle
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.480]   between socialism and free market democracy.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.720]   And I think that we're seeing it all happen at once
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.160]   because of globalism
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.400]   and because of the fact that globalism
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.720]   has enabled, just like we've seen manifest
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.400]   in the United States,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.800]   massive and significant economic progress,
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.120]   but at the cost of a small number of people
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.280]   becoming very wealthy
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.720]   and a large number of people feeling left behind
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.960]   as a result of the wealth accumulating
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.440]   in a major way to a small number of people.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.640]   And the reaction that we're seeing in France,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.400]   in India, in Mexico, in the US, in the UK
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.800]   is all very much kind of aligned.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.480]   That there is this big push that socialist practices
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.920]   can perhaps resolve the inequality
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.520]   and the inefficiencies that are seen in the markets today.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.200]   And this is being manifested
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.600]   in a lot of really nasty ways.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.080]   First of all, I think it's rationalized as being,
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.800]   hey, there's economic excess for a few
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.600]   while the majority are left behind.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.400]   It's activated by big bureaucracy,
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.480]   by anti-free market principles
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.640]   and by tax policies and spending policies
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.880]   that will ultimately cripple economic growth.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.280]   And I don't wanna say I'm against taxes
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.400]   'cause I'm all for taxes to make up for budget deficits.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   But I think the results are ultimately across all of this
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.640]   gonna be what we saw happen in Argentina,
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.640]   which I think is on the other side of this problem,
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.600]   which is unsustainable debt accumulation,
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.240]   massive inflation and crippling unemployment.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.080]   And I think that we should really take a hard look
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.840]   at what's happening around the world right now
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.120]   as being all related.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.320]   All of the industrialized world
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.760]   is voting in a similar way
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.000]   and starting to shift in a similar way
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.760]   that we should be fairly concerned about
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.840]   and pay a lot of attention to.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.520]   In the US, there's this expectation
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.680]   that Trump is gonna totally trounce Biden
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.120]   if Biden stays in the race.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:42.320]   I think that if we see the same sort of thing happen
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.280]   in the US in that the psyche of people
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.880]   are that we feel left behind,
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.720]   that there's a hierarchical system
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.240]   that disadvantages the majority of people
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.080]   because economic progress is not proportional to everyone.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.120]   You could end up seeing a surprise sort of voting system
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.760]   emerge in the US where the left may win
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.880]   because socialist principles are on the rise
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.960]   in the psyche of the youth in the industrialized world.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.480]   And I'm not saying I'm making a prediction
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.600]   about how the election is gonna go in the US,
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.120]   but I do think that there's a big kind of
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.440]   fundamental change underway here.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.320]   - Sax, you didn't mention immigration,
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.480]   specifically Muslim, Islamic immigration in France.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.160]   That seems to be a big part of this issue
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.400]   that people aren't talking about
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.240]   and the lack of integration of that population into society.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.920]   In fact, I've been told by folks in France
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.360]   that it's kind of the opposite,
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:39.360]   like Islamic Muslim immigrants are kind of shunned
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.960]   and aren't integrated by the French people themselves.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.040]   I'm not sure how true that is.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.880]   I don't have a lot of firsthand experience in it,
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.360]   but how much of that is part of what's happening
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   in this right-left Donnybrook occurring in France?
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.080]   'Cause they're literally on the streets
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.640]   fighting and yeah, rioting.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.040]   - Yeah, look, I don't think that the youth's demand
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.880]   for socialism is what's driving
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.200]   the results in France at all.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.360]   Let me explain what happened.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.920]   So the way that the voting works in France,
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.600]   it's an unusual system to our eyes
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.720]   where they have a first round of voting.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.600]   And in that first round of voting,
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.680]   Marine Le Pen's party national rally
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.200]   won a strong plurality of the vote.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.040]   And the map looked like this,
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:28.120]   where literally they won every district in the country,
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.120]   except for Paris.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.240]   I mean, it was a really dominant performance.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.360]   And so people were expecting major reform.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.480]   And Jake, you're right that Marine Le Pen's major issue,
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.240]   her party, is the unlimited immigration
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.400]   that's taken place into France.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.840]   The French people or a substantial portion of them
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.960]   are up in arms about this.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   And actually, this is something
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.800]   that's very common across all of Europe.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.640]   They're tired-
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.480]   - They're very nationalistic.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.320]   Let's call it what it is.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.440]   - Well, it's-
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.720]   - They care about their culture.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.880]   - The indigenous people of France
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.960]   are opposed to the settler colonial invasion
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.800]   that's happening from the global South.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.440]   And they wanna preserve their French culture
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.880]   and society and nation as it has always been.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.040]   And they do not see how this unlimited immigration
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.400]   from the global South is good for them.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.800]   It's not good for them economically.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.600]   It's not good for societal cohesiveness.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.880]   It's not good for crime and so on.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.440]   So this is undoubtedly a huge driver
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.280]   of national rally success.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.520]   But then what happened is that in the French system,
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.800]   there's a second round of voting a week later.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.640]   And we got these results
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.280]   where national rallies still got the plurality of the vote.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   They got 37% of the vote, but they only won 142 seats.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.800]   Whereas Macron's party got 22% of the vote, won 148.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.360]   And then a collection of parties
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.960]   called the New Popular Front,
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.460]   which is basically a collection of far-left parties
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:56.720]   under the radical socialists, Jean-Luc Mélenchon,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.040]   won only 27% of the vote, but won the most seats.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.760]   And this is what I think Freeberg's reacting to
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.560]   is that the socialists ended up with the most seats.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.680]   Well, how did this happen if National Rally,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.840]   Marine Le Pen's party got a lot more votes
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.280]   than New Popular Front?
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:15.880]   The answer is that Macron, President of France,
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.520]   conspired with the far-left
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.160]   to have 200 candidates quit
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.680]   to basically drive those voters,
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.960]   the voters in let's call it the center-left,
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.400]   over to the far-left
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.000]   in order to block Marine Le Pen's party
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.160]   from winning the number of seats
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.160]   that they otherwise would have.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.040]   - So just to recap what you're talking about,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.860]   they have two rounds of elections here.
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.160]   They have a first round, a second round.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.880]   If you don't win the majority in the first round,
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.880]   then it goes to the second round runoff.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.920]   And then strategically,
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.720]   what Macron and his party did was
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.280]   they took the multiple parties and said,
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.560]   "Hey, we'll just have y'all drop out
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.120]   "and consolidate our votes."
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.000]   Almost like in a microcosm in the United States,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.080]   it would be like RFK dropping out at the last minute
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.460]   and saying, "I endorse this person on left or right."
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.840]   So they did a very strategic thing to--
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.640]   - Right, but they went district by district
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.480]   and they basically said, "Okay."
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.040]   - Oh, great strategy, yeah.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.600]   - "Hold on, in this district we're gonna let the,
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.440]   "we're gonna have Macron's candidate drop out
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.640]   "and endorse New Popular Front."
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.800]   - They cut deals.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.260]   - Exactly, so that's what they did.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.280]   - So brilliant.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.840]   - Well, it's a manipulated result
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.640]   and what it ends up with,
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.480]   look, a lot of people said,
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.120]   "So actually you're saying that they rigged the election."
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.880]   Look, they didn't rig the votes, okay?
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.800]   I have no reason to believe that the votes aren't real.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.580]   But they did rig the candidates
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.360]   in order to frustrate the desire
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.680]   of the French people for reform,
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.560]   the reform that Marine Le Pen was offering.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.040]   And, Freeberg, you're interpreting this
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.920]   as basically a big endorsement for socialism.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.680]   I don't think that's what this is.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.080]   I think that what happened here
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.320]   is that the center-left under Macron
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.720]   was willing to throw the election through legal,
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.240]   I'm not saying they did anything illegal,
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.000]   through legal manipulation.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.680]   - They consolidated the candidates.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.400]   And so, to me, it's sad that,
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.480]   one person tweeted that,
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.620]   "We voted for reform.
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.780]   "We voted for national sovereignty.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:12.000]   "We voted to restrict unlimited immigration.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.840]   "And what we got was communism.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.680]   "This isn't what we voted for."
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.280]   And so it's just kind of sad that what's happening
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.360]   is that the system, the system politicians,
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.880]   are essentially getting together to frustrate
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.040]   the popular will of the people.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.820]   - Le Pen's party still got outvoted
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.040]   in each of those districts, right?
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.120]   Is that correct?
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.380]   - Only because--
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.680]   - They dropped a candidate.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.880]   - 200 candidates basically were strategically dropped out
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.140]   in order to throw the vote in those districts.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.300]   - So all these systems ultimately resolved
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.340]   to a two-party system where some minority
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.460]   can hijack one of the parties
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:49.620]   to enforce their will ideologically.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.180]   I think that's kind of my point.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.460]   In fact, I mean, the day after the election,
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.160]   there was this statement
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.340]   on some of their economic priorities.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:02.060]   "Increase the tax rate to 90% on income over 400K.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.020]   "Drop the retirement age from 64 to 60."
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.660]   I mean, you go down the list,
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:11.660]   putting in price controls on free market services
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.340]   and products and goods,
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.780]   this is a lot of what we're seeing kind of repeated
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.300]   in a bunch of different ways.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.700]   It's all the same story with different characters
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:20.980]   all over the industrialized world.
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:21.820]   - You're right about that part.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.760]   So basically, on the heels of this vote
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.400]   with New Popular Front winning all these seats,
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.600]   Jean-Luc Mélenchon gives this speech
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.240]   in which he rails basically
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.980]   against Macron's neoliberal policies.
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:37.580]   He wants to go back to the restricted number of hours
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.420]   in the work week.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:42.020]   He wants a 90% wealth tax and so on across the board.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.460]   He does want radical socialism.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:48.180]   And he says that he will not cooperate with Macron's party.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.900]   So, I mean, this is like just,
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.020]   it's almost cartoonish and clownish
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.900]   how much this has backfired on Macron.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.140]   He was so hellbent on trying to frustrate Marine Le Pen
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.220]   that he threw the election to New Popular Front
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.140]   who has now announced that they will not work with him.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.980]   Okay?
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.340]   Now, Jake, you may want to say,
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.760]   well, this is the will of the majority.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.100]   But the majority of the country
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.620]   did not want to vote for chaos.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:13.020]   But chaos is what they've got
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:15.900]   because now there is no dominant faction
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.500]   in their parliament, right?
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.580]   And New Popular Front--
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.660]   - By the way, same in India.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.540]   They just lost majority in India, right?
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.460]   Which is the first time in 12 years.
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.380]   And the UK's also up in disarray.
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.420]   - No, there's a, it's a majority, but not a super majority.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.520]   - Not a super majority, sorry.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.360]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.820]   - The good news, Freeberg, is that Mélenchon
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.180]   will not have a majority in the assembly
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.820]   to push through those radical policies that he wants.
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.580]   No faction will have a majority
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.060]   because they're not gonna work with each other.
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:44.220]   You've got three big parties here, or three big groups,
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.220]   and you need two of them working together
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.460]   to get anything done.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.260]   So what's gonna happen is you're just gonna have,
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:51.580]   basically, a logjam.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.340]   And like Marine Le Pen said,
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:56.020]   reform in France is just gonna have to wait,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.500]   and we're gonna lose another year.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.100]   - Do you think socialist ideologies are on the rise
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.820]   in the youth, in the industrialized world?
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.780]   And is that showing up in elections around the world?
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.940]   - I think what's happening is that
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.620]   there is a pent-up demand for reform.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.060]   People are craving reform.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.500]   They understand that the system does not work.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.060]   It is corrupt. - It feels rigged for everyone.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.060]   - It feels rigged, it feels corrupt,
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.700]   and it's resistant to reform.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:23.180]   And so they are basically clamoring for that.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.300]   And they will get it wherever they can take it.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.860]   - In the past, socialism has won, when this has happened.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.260]   This happened after World War I.
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.780]   It's happened multiple times in history
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.820]   where we've seen the socialists rise in these moments.
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.300]   - Well, I don't think it's because
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.180]   socialism is that desirable.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.420]   I actually think that the desire for reform,
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.740]   I think it is first and foremost looking for
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:48.660]   what I would call a nationalist populist solution.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.940]   - Right. - And you can see here
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.580]   that National Rally did do better
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:54.180]   than New Popular Front, considerably better,
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:58.500]   but it was the system's desire to hand a victory
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.460]   to New Popular Front that gave them the win.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.420]   And I think you see a similar thing in the United States.
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.780]   Look, if Joe Biden had just shut down the border
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.300]   for the last four years-- - Oh, yeah, huge win.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.420]   - He would be in a materially different position.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.860]   - Absolutely. - But the radicals
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.060]   in his party didn't wanna do that.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.020]   So in a way, you could say that you have a similar type
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.620]   of conspiracy taking place where the center-left
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:25.580]   would rather enable and support the radical progressives
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.900]   as opposed to making sensible moderations
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:29.740]   or sensible adjustments-- - Which, by the way--
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.940]   - That would actually make them much more popular.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.620]   - It would, and what has Trump done in Trump 2.0
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:38.700]   that I think, I don't know who could have possibly coached
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.980]   or given any feedback to Trump of how to win this election,
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:45.100]   but he seems much more presidential, he seems normal,
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.020]   he basically went right to the middle on abortion,
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.980]   he went right to the middle on immigration,
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.460]   and he's not acting like a lunatic in name-calling
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.380]   and his debate performance was fantastic.
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.780]   He just sat back-- - By the way, look,
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:00.780]   look who's been the most ardent supporter of Joe Biden.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.620]   It's been the progressive left, right?
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.460]   Those are the folks that have actually said,
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.860]   hey, and I think probably it's because there's
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.860]   a underlying quid pro quo at play, AOC, Bernie Sanders,
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.740]   all of these folks-- - Elizabeth Warren.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.500]   - If they support Biden and he wins a second term,
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.580]   I suspect that there's going to be a lot
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.220]   of their legislative agenda
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.820]   that basically gets put up for vote.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.300]   - 100%, 100%, yes.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.780]   - I think there's a common denominator here
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.420]   that both Macron and Biden would rather throw
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.940]   the government of the country to radicals and communists
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.740]   than implement sensible restrictions on immigration.
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:46.180]   It's mind-blowing to me that neither Macron nor Biden
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.700]   can simply make a sensible adjustment on immigration.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.220]   People do not want open borders.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.380]   They especially don't want them in Europe,
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.740]   and they don't want them here either.
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.340]   - That's fair. - They want reasonable borders,
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.380]   reasonable immigration.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.700]   - If I had to kind of give you my opinion on all of this,
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.900]   I do think that when you look across all of these countries,
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.740]   I do think Freeberg is touching on something,
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.620]   but I think the explanation doesn't have to be
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.260]   this idea that people are embracing socialism.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.460]   I think there's a much simpler explanation as well,
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.300]   which is that we've gone through a very difficult period
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.860]   of joblessness, of inflation, of high costs,
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.300]   and I think typically what happens
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.980]   is you have governmental turnover in these moments,
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.580]   and so the incumbent gets tossed out
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.500]   and somebody else comes in,
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.660]   and whatever they're saying seems like the new thing.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.700]   So for example, in Canada right now,
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.900]   the opposite is trending,
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.940]   which is the liberal socialist government
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.700]   just looks totally incompetent,
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.740]   and it looks like the progressives,
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.980]   when this election happens,
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.540]   is just gonna completely run over them,
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.620]   and so that's more of a swing to the right.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.340]   So I think it's less left or right.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.940]   I think it's incumbent people
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.780]   who have not done necessarily a great job
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.300]   in these last four years getting tossed out
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.580]   for folks that are new,
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.300]   and I think that explains a lot of these elections
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.060]   more than socialism or anything else.
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:03.980]   - I really hope you're right.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:08.980]   I just worry about the trend of economic globalization
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.140]   has kind of moved every,
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.620]   'cause it used to be that every country
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.660]   kind of looked like its own country politically,
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.140]   and there's just a lot of alignment happening.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.660]   - Where Saxe is right, it's like,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.060]   look, in every other country of the world,
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.660]   other than the West,
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.980]   you embrace the national traditions
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.140]   that make a culture its own.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.660]   But if you came to Sri Lanka,
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.100]   you'd see people in saris,
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.940]   you'd see people dressed in traditional garb,
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.340]   you speak this one language that's somewhat complicated,
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.900]   not spoken anywhere else,
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.580]   although we teach English as well.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.660]   But the point is that there are these cultural traditions,
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.900]   and that's just an example of a country that I know well,
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.060]   but many countries, if you look across Africa,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.860]   it's the same, if you look across Asia,
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.860]   Central and South America.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.220]   In the West, it's more of that you come
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.620]   and there's this kind of like odd monoculture,
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:00.780]   and I think at some point,
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.180]   people are pushing back against that.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.740]   I do agree with David that there is that pushback,
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.340]   and I think that that's a reasonable pushback.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.180]   - America's very unique in that.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.380]   We had a concept called the melting pot,
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.260]   where you would culturally assimilate.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.660]   And if you say that today,
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.020]   and you were to teach that in schools,
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.820]   I think people would get very upset.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.660]   - Very upset. - Thinking like,
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.620]   you are giving up your culture.
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.500]   No, you've chosen to leave your land
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.460]   and make a new world here in this new experiment
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.860]   called America.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.900]   And if you assimilate, you're welcome here.
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.620]   If you don't want to assimilate,
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:32.660]   you're not welcome in America.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.060]   That's what they taught when we went to school
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.940]   as Gen Xers in the '70s and '80s.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.140]   - No, no, no, so my only point sits,
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.500]   and I agree with you, Jekyll,
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.060]   is as a country, you're allowed to have those beliefs.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.740]   It's not that just because you're in the West,
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.100]   you have to throw that out,
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.460]   and all of a sudden, you have to succumb to this belief
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.800]   that everybody else's culture is better
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.100]   than the one that you've had
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.540]   for the last 400 or 500 years.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.580]   I don't think that that's necessarily true.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.020]   And I think you miss out on a lot by saying that.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:03.520]   So to your point, I just think that when you look globally,
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.020]   there's a really interesting quote from Peter Thiel
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.500]   that actually is, he made this comment,
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.260]   which is, if you look at the 10 commandments,
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:13.780]   he's like, the first and the 10th are the most powerful,
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.020]   because the first one is about looking up,
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.340]   and the 10th is not about looking down,
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.060]   and everything else is about looking left and right of you.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.020]   And he brings it up in this context
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.100]   of all of these commandments, the middle eight,
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.160]   are all about how you should not be looking
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.020]   to the left and the right,
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.880]   figuring out and making yourself getting tilted
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.860]   about the fact that you have less than the other person.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.460]   - No coveting.
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:39.100]   - And I just think that there may be something interesting
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.580]   in that idea, which is that what we've really done
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.400]   is we've created tools that have allowed you
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.220]   to just obsess and fantasize
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.580]   about all these random people's lives
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.540]   who you think are perfect,
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.340]   but they're just manufactured trying to get views anyways,
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:57.600]   and you just leave being angry and thinking your life sucks.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.020]   And in fact, your life is actually not that bad.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.740]   And I think if we had more truth
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.460]   and honesty and authenticity,
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.580]   maybe there would be less of this perception
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.360]   and you'd actually try to just enjoy what you have.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.900]   And I don't think we figured that out.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.860]   - Let's wrap up here on the hot swap summer update
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.580]   and the speed run primary.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.580]   Biden still insists he's still running for president
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.860]   and he will not stand down.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.860]   Since the last episode, so much has happened,
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.980]   including George Clooney writing an op-ed
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.260]   in the New York Times this week,
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.700]   "I love Joe Biden, but we need a new nominee."
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.180]   Two weeks ago, Clooney co-hosted a fundraiser,
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.980]   Katzenberg and some other Hollywood bigwigs
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.700]   that raised 30 million for President Biden,
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:44.260]   twice as much as you guys did for Trump.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.020]   But I mean, this is Hollywood and Clooney we're talking about.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.220]   - Well, they had 95,000 people.
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.400]   We had a hundred people.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.240]   - I know, I'm just saying,
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.740]   it's really impressive what you guys did.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:57.740]   Clooney is also besties with Obama.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:01.460]   And Obama has put out a tweet in support of Biden,
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.340]   but according to a political report,
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.460]   Clooney gave Obama the heads up before he published this.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.420]   NBC is reporting that Biden has lost his donor base.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.580]   Anonymous quotes, "The money has absolutely shut off.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.420]   It's already disastrous."
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.640]   Two of the sources said,
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.540]   "This month is on a path to be down by possibly half
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.500]   or much more from large donors."
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:26.280]   Adam Schiff, who is as partisan as they come,
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.620]   said Biden should slow down
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.580]   and make the right decision here.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.180]   He also said he should get new counsel,
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.180]   independent counsel.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.400]   So that was on "Meet the Press."
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.700]   And Nancy Pelosi gave a non-answer
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.820]   when asked if she supports Biden as the nominee.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.420]   And again, as partisan as they come.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.580]   Tim Kaine said, "Complete confidence,
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.340]   Joe Biden will do the patriotic thing
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.300]   in regards to his future as nominee."
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.860]   Yeah, that's pretty rough.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.100]   And Axios reported that Chuck Schumer has-
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.980]   - Let me ask you, I'm putting you on the spot here.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.960]   I'm putting you on the spot.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.400]   - You've seen all these clips.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.240]   - Yeah.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.920]   - Do you think that there's an active coverup going on
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.160]   by the White House about his cognitive...
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.000]   - Hold on.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.700]   No stracanis is gonna make a prediction.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.300]   I've got it.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.260]   A whistleblower will emerge in the next 10 days.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:17.260]   If you are a doctor, a nurse, a secretary, an EA,
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.900]   or part of the inner circle here,
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.140]   and you know he's in cognitive decline,
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.940]   whistleblow it.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.020]   Hock to on that whistle and get it out there, folks.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.480]   Because we know there's a coverup.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.700]   We know there's a coverup.
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.100]   So spit on that thang.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:35.940]   - That's right.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.720]   All right, hock to that whistle.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.940]   - Hock to and let's get it out there
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.460]   because also coming out-
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.500]   - No, but sorry, kidding aside,
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.020]   you think there's a coverup?
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.340]   - Of course there's a coverup.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.940]   I mean, come on.
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.940]   Did you see this report that a doctor,
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.380]   a neurologist went to the White House-
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.340]   - Visited the White House.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.580]   - Visited, and the New York Times is putting this out there.
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:01.300]   And then watch this clip of KJP,
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.620]   who is absolutely covering everything up.
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.780]   We all play poker.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.740]   This person is bluffing.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.620]   They're lying.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:08.620]   It's so obvious.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.140]   Play the clip, Nick.
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.020]   - That's a very basic direct question.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.740]   - Wait, hold on, hold on.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.460]   Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.500]   - Eight times or at least once
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.660]   in regards to the president specifically.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:21.500]   - Hold on a second.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.740]   - That's not what you should be able to answer
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.580]   by this point.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.900]   - Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.660]   No, wait a minute.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:30.420]   Ed, please, a little respect here, please.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:35.140]   Every year around the president's physical examination,
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.260]   he sees a neurologist.
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.260]   That's three times, right?
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:41.620]   So I am telling you that he has seen a neurologist
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.260]   three times while he has been in this presidency.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.780]   So that is answering that question.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.620]   - No, it's not.
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.460]   - No, it is, it is.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.300]   You're asking-
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.620]   - Dr. Kevin Kennard, come to the White House.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.660]   - Can I just add, I also said to you, Ed,
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.940]   I also said to you, for security reasons,
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.500]   we cannot share names.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.340]   - It is public information.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.180]   - It's public.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.020]   - I hear you.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.860]   - The name's public.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:05.860]   - Guys, guys, guys, guys, hold on a second.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.220]   - The point of a press conference
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.580]   is that you ask questions and you ask hard questions.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.940]   This person is covering it up.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.300]   It is a huge coverup.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.860]   I haven't seen somebody lie this bold face
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.020]   since Elizabeth Holmes.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.540]   If you had the machine that did the blood test,
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.020]   you'd show the machine.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.180]   If there's a cognitive test that shows he's not in decline,
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.500]   they would show the test.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.780]   Show the test.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.260]   If you're a whistleblower, release the test.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.500]   Somebody out there has the results of these tests.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.660]   And if you're a doctor and you're covering this up,
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.180]   if you work in that White House and you're covering this up,
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.260]   it's the most unethical, un-American,
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.260]   immoral thing you can do.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.700]   And this is the reason we have whistleblower protections.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.580]   There are 50 people who probably know what's going on here.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.060]   And I know there's at least five.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.900]   So somewhere in that number is somebody
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.660]   who has a profile and courage,
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:55.740]   who will come out and tell the American people
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.180]   what the hell is going on here.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.420]   - Oh, I think we already know what's going on, J. Cal.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.700]   - I know, but this not telling the truth
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.820]   in a press conference with the press,
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.380]   and then admonishing the press,
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.900]   admonishing the press like this,
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.420]   it's complete utter bullshit.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.060]   - So in that press conference,
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.940]   it's nice to see the press actually doing their job
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:17.820]   because their job is to hold truth to account
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.820]   and to actually ask tough questions,
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.580]   and they're finally doing it.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:23.460]   But I see in that press conference
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.180]   not just a liar at the podium,
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.060]   I think the entire audience are a bunch of liars too
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.180]   because they knew, they knew the truth about the situation
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.700]   and they refused to report it
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:35.380]   and they refused to investigate it until now.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.740]   Now, what you've heard in the past week or so
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.700]   is a bunch of people who knew about the situation
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.940]   telling on themselves.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:44.620]   So first you had George Clooney.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.860]   In that New York Times op-ed,
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.460]   he says that after the fundraiser we did,
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.540]   yeah, I knew, and everyone there knew.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.700]   That was a month ago.
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.660]   What took you so long to come out?
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.820]   Olivia Nuzzi says she had the story
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.580]   for New York Magazine six months ago, okay?
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.540]   She had anonymous sources,
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.860]   but she said she was afraid to publish it
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.060]   because the White House would basically push back
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.020]   and she didn't think the press would back her.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.460]   Chuck Todd just said it on a podcast
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:14.340]   that a cabinet official, okay, in the Biden White House
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.900]   told him two years ago
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.940]   that he could not get a meeting with the president
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.340]   because the president was effectively incapacitated
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.740]   and his inner circle was keeping him shielded.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.060]   Chuck Todd knew.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.820]   Why didn't Chuck Todd report that?
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.740]   Why didn't Chuck Todd pass it on
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.900]   to an investigative reporter at NBC to investigate that?
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.780]   These people covered-- - Dereliction of duty
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.620]   is the answer. - Dereliction of duty.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.220]   - It's a dereliction of duty.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.660]   - Of course, but let me tell you
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:39.360]   what they were trying to do, okay?
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.860]   They were trying to weaken a Bernie's this thing.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.220]   - Absolutely. - They thought
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.380]   they could get Biden through the election
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.020]   and so they were on narrative
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.740]   and they weren't gonna report the truth
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.580]   about his condition. - 100%.
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.140]   - They were just gonna try and get him
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.180]   across the finish line.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:57.060]   They're all complicit in this coverup
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.100]   and they don't deserve any credibility
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.620]   because now they're finally reporting it
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.260]   because the only reason they're reporting it
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.880]   is because of concerns about Biden's electability.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.800]   They're afraid that he's gonna lose
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.740]   and the turning point was that debate
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.340]   because the whole country could see it.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.540]   So in the wake of that, they're starting to panic
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.020]   and they're realizing, oh wait, we need a new candidate.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.580]   So finally, they're telling the truth about the situation
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.100]   but they had absolutely no intention
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.500]   telling the truth about it
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.900]   because they could have done it a long time ago.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.100]   - And here is all you-- - They were just gonna try
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.940]   and drag Biden across the finish line.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.540]   - And we need to give one person his flat horse here.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.620]   Dean Phillips came on this program seven months ago
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:35.620]   and if you listen to All In,
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.040]   the number one podcast in the world,
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.500]   you're going to know what's gonna happen in the future.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.060]   It's not just Nostracanus here,
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.900]   the guests come on and tell us the truth.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.620]   Dean Phillips told us, I quote,
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.940]   when I asked him, I'm not sure who asked him,
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.780]   when we asked him, he said,
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:54.300]   "People are saying that I'm causing his problems,
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.180]   "that I could risk his re-election.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.740]   "I'm certainly not the guy that has shown his decline."
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.500]   That's on video, that's on audio, you see it.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.780]   He's a human being for goodness sake.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.860]   Seven months ago, he said this.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.420]   He's a human being, he's now in his 80s,
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.860]   he is clearly in decline,
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:13.220]   but do I think he will be in a position
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.980]   to continue leading this country in the future?
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.200]   I do not.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.100]   I think I'm joined about 75% of the country in saying that.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.700]   He was clear on this podcast.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:22.980]   - He was clear on this podcast
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.940]   and kudos to Dean Phillips
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.780]   for having the courage to tell the truth.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.500]   He was one of the only people in the Democratic Party
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.340]   to tell the truth.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.660]   Remember, he also said in our podcast
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.140]   that he called up J.B. Pritzker,
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.380]   he called up Gretchen Whitmer.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.680]   He said, "Where are you guys?
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.220]   "You're the leaders of the Democrat Party.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.940]   "Why aren't you challenging President Biden?
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.100]   "He obviously isn't fit to serve."
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.140]   They told him, "Shut up."
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.620]   They wouldn't take his phone calls, okay?
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.780]   And look, Dean Phillips knew the truth
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.780]   without having special access to the president.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.380]   Quite frankly, he's a backbencher, right?
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.020]   But it was obvious to him.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.500]   They all knew, the whole party knew,
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:57.700]   but their strategy was to pretend and deny.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.620]   And to portray anyone who told,
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.900]   to excommunicate anyone like Dean Phillips
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.540]   who told the truth and to try and discredit
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.020]   anyone who reported the truth
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:08.640]   as basically a partisan or a liar
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.680]   who was trafficking in the fakes.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.520]   Remember that?
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.800]   - It's sick. - So all these people
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.640]   are complicit.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640]   They're all complicit.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.800]   And the only reason they're telling the truth now
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800]   is 'cause they're afraid of losing an election.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.600]   - Well, and the receipts are coming.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.760]   - Well, let's just play this out.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.600]   So if there is a grand cover-up,
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.200]   I think, Jason, you are right,
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.160]   that there is too much time between now and the election.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:34.160]   There will be a deep throat Watergate-style leak here.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.020]   You know, there will be a Woodward and Bernstein
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.100]   that gets to the bottom of this.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.620]   I just think the odds of that--
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.460]   - Are 100%.
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.900]   - Of it not happening are too low.
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.200]   So I guess then the real question is,
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.900]   is it that the only way to keep the charade going
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:53.020]   is the quote-unquote threat of the Donald Trump boogeyman?
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.520]   Is that what they use, basically,
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.700]   to hang over these people to--
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:57.840]   - Of course, yes.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.820]   I mean, listen, that worked last time.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.740]   Trump, the overwhelming majority of Americans
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.100]   felt Trump's first presidency was too divisive
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.460]   and it was too chaotic.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.440]   They used that to win.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.900]   Okay, fair enough.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.640]   Now they're trying to use that again.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.480]   It's not working.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.320]   Why?
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.140]   Trump 2.0.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.060]   He's coming across as reasonable.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.020]   A lot of the things he got right,
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:21.900]   when you re-underrided him about the border,
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.720]   he got that right.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.140]   The economy was pretty good under him.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.540]   He did some things correct.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.580]   He's not like all demagogue and all evil.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.540]   I have my problems with his behavior.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.260]   I've made it documented here,
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.820]   but you cannot use that excuse anymore
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.340]   because Americans are gonna say cognitive decline,
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.740]   somebody with Alzheimer's, like my aunt, my uncle,
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.520]   my parent, whatever, they've experienced it firsthand.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.100]   For Trump, it's an easy choice for most Americans
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.380]   and that's why Trump will beat Biden
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.980]   and that's why they're gonna do the speed run
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.780]   and that's catching steam next.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:53.660]   And let's just, we can wrap on that, I think.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.580]   I mentioned here the speed run primary
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.660]   a couple of weeks ago.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.900]   Nick, roll the clip.
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.020]   Must credit Nostradamus.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:05.060]   They're gonna do a democratic primary speed run.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.020]   Here's what's gonna happen.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:08.860]   They're gonna do five debates in 10 weeks
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.540]   and then whoever wins, wins.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.240]   Kamala, he's gonna resign.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.860]   Kamala becomes president.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:17.420]   Kamala gets to run in the speed run.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.280]   She gets to speed run like everybody else.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.540]   Dean Phillips gets to come in.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.340]   Everybody speed runs it.
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.820]   They take over the media.
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:27.240]   The media will go crazy over the summer,
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.300]   massive ratings, boom.
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.020]   Pull up the Semaphore article.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.100]   After I made my prediction,
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.660]   two Democratic Party insiders
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:37.180]   have floated this very unique idea in Semaphore.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.580]   It's a pretty obvious idea, I guess.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.940]   Biden steps down as the nominee in July.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.620]   - Wait, where did you get it from, J. Cal?
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.460]   - It was my idea.
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.020]   - 'Cause I mean-- - I did not hear it anywhere.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.860]   - Okay, I personally don't think it's gonna happen
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.140]   but I still think you deserve credit for being the first.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.660]   - I agree. - So you came up with this
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.700]   and now it's a spread or what?
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.580]   - Oh, well, here we go.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.940]   Semaphore-- - This is amazing.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.660]   - I mean, you're name checking yourself here.
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.980]   So this is pretty-- - I don't know what's happening
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.300]   in this bizarro universe.
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.780]   I put on a red tie and all of a sudden
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:03.940]   I'm getting everything right.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:04.780]   Who knows?
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.300]   Biden steps down-- - I mean, you're--
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.900]   Listen, so many times in the past
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.260]   your head has been so far up your ass
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.700]   but this time it's really real.
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.100]   You open it and you see your face
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.100]   but it's you just name checking yourself.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.140]   - I guess I gotta name check me.
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.740]   But here's what Semaphore says.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.580]   This is their version.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.980]   Biden steps down as the nominee mid-July.
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.100]   Okay, that's now.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.340]   Biden announces the new system with support
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.280]   from Kamala Harris.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.500]   Candidates would have a few days
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.500]   to throw their hats in the ring.
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.160]   Democrats would start a primary sprint.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.320]   Oh, not a speed run, a primary sprint.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.500]   Where six candidates, not 10,
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.060]   who've received the most votes from delegates
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.600]   pledge to run positive only campaigns
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.020]   in the month leading up to the DNC.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.980]   Weekly forums for each candidate
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.700]   would be moderated by cultural icons.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.340]   Oh, interesting punch up.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.780]   Michelle Obama, Oprah, Taylor Swift
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.220]   in order to engage voters.
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.900]   As I talked about taking over the media,
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.580]   nominee will be chosen by delegates
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.340]   using rank choice voting, your favorite sacks,
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.300]   before the start of the DNC on August 9th.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.080]   So anyway, there you have it folks.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.020]   Speed run coming, whistleblower, August 19th.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.420]   Speed run and the whistleblower.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.540]   Look for it this month.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.380]   - Okay, look, I think you deserve credit
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.660]   for being the first to talk about this.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:12.140]   And that idea is clearly gaining some currency on the left.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.500]   However, at the end of the day,
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.820]   I don't think the Democrats can afford to do that
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:18.020]   because they're already in a state of chaos right now.
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.720]   And if they finally succeed in pushing Biden overboard,
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.780]   the last thing they're gonna wanna do
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.120]   is have the chaos of an open primary,
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.380]   even if it is a speed run primary.
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.700]   I think they're just gonna have to go to Kamala Harris.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.960]   I think that's what they've decided.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.080]   I think that if they succeed at pushing Biden out,
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:36.100]   which does seem probably more likely than not at this point,
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.820]   I think it's gotta be Harris.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.860]   And I think she's gonna be the nominee.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.700]   So I just don't think-- - You think Harris
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:41.520]   can beat Trump?
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.100]   You worried about him?
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.860]   - Well, no, look, I think that Trump should win regardless,
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:50.380]   but it's an opportunity for them to reset the race.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.660]   And that's what's driving all of this
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:54.400]   is that they're concerned about losing.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.680]   But look, let me say this,
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.880]   that everything that's happened here
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.200]   with Biden's cognitive state,
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.920]   it's just one in a series of hoaxes and cover-ups
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.400]   that the Democrat party has transpired
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.120]   over the last several years.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.800]   It's gotten to the point where you have to wonder,
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.680]   can these guys even run a presidential campaign
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.000]   without hoaxes?
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.560]   You had the Steele dossier, okay?
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.200]   You have the whole suckers and losers hoax.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.040]   You have the very fine people hoax.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.180]   You have the, this is the best version of Biden hoax.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.380]   You had the whole cheap fake hoax.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:29.380]   And you've just got to wonder,
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:31.100]   is this a party who deserves
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.820]   the trust of the American people?
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.900]   I think that Trump deserves another term
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:38.220]   just as a rebuke to all of the misinformation and lies
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.000]   that the Democratic party has told about him.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.420]   And I think that he should win.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.700]   - Shout out to Scott Adams and his hoax list.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.540]   Here we go.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.180]   The Scott Adams, he's a, Scott Adams is obsessed with his--
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:50.200]   - That's like 20% of the hoax list.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.020]   There's like 10 more, okay.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.140]   - No, he's been keeping a list, yeah.
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.860]   - Trump deserves to win just based on all the hoaxes
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.020]   that have been thrown at him.
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:58.860]   - All right.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.700]   - And you know what, you got to give him credit
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:04.300]   because it was his decision to go on CNN in that debate
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.860]   that really called their birth on this whole thing.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.060]   - God, when they started,
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.100]   this is when you knew something was in the air.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.340]   When he got like, started getting ovations and clapping
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:18.180]   from the rigged CNN audience for the town hall.
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:21.960]   I mean, or maybe CNN did that and set up themselves
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.240]   and set up the Democrats, I don't know.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.280]   - I don't think it was a setup.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280]   - You don't think it was a setup?
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.100]   - No, I think, look, there are a lot of people
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.200]   who do think that it was a controlled demolition
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.480]   and they want Biden out.
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:32.320]   I don't think so.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.140]   I think this situation is so--
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.380]   - Wow, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.700]   - It is a conspiracy theory and I understand
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.160]   why people might think that
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.280]   because so many conspiracy theories
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.340]   have turned out to be true.
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:41.960]   However, I don't believe that's what happened.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.240]   I believe-- - Fascinating.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:46.920]   - That Biden's staff created conditions for the debate
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.580]   that they thought would be untenable to Trump, right?
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.840]   They said that we're gonna choose the host,
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.320]   they're gonna be hosts who basically already
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.000]   called Trump Hitler, right?
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.040]   So it's like the most favorable setting.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.400]   They said there's not gonna be an audience,
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.000]   we're gonna turn off your microphone
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.700]   and they thought that Trump would just say no to all of this
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.640]   and they'd be able to get Biden through without debate.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.340]   But Trump called their bluff.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.360]   He said, okay, I'll do it.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.200]   - Sure.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.520]   - And he walked into the lion's den,
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.200]   just like, remember, a year ago,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.740]   he walked into the lion's den at CNN
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.000]   to do that town hall. - Yeah, he's fearless.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.200]   - Remember, he is fearless. - He can beat anybody
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.340]   comedically.
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.080]   - You gotta admit that Trump has the huevos.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.960]   - He can comedically beat anybody in mainstream media.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.040]   - You gotta admit that Trump has the huevos.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.640]   Like Tony Montana said,
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.400]   the only thing in this world that gives orders is balls.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.720]   - Absolutely. - You gotta admit.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.560]   - Hot to a.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.460]   - You gotta hot to those. - Don't forget the balls.
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:37.720]   (laughing)
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.560]   This episode's off the rails.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.760]   For the chairman dictator calling in from Italy,
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.600]   my bestie, David Sachs,
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.700]   I'll see you on Jussie Waters,
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.240]   and at the RNC.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.580]   For Freeberg, who's genuflecting somewhere
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:53.880]   in a retreat center, I am.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.440]   No stracanis, and I have a prediction.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   (laughing)
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.920]   I have a prediction.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.160]   We're gonna see you at the next episode, everybody.
