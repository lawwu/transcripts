[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   All right, let's do a, where are we at?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.500]   We have time, let's do a call.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.080]   Let's do one more call
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.400]   and then we can call it quits for today.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   - Sounds good, we got a call from a monk.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.000]   - Cal, I'm inspired by your work, thank you.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.480]   My name is Etienne and I'm a Benedictine monk
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.080]   in the United States.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.100]   The idea of deep work and the deep life
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.300]   is really resonant with me.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.160]   Part of my work is educating and forming young men
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.920]   to become leaders in the Catholic church.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.920]   I wish to model and teach them deep work,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.320]   slow productivity, the deep life,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.600]   digital minimalism, et cetera.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.040]   Do you have thoughts on how I might be a good mentor
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.360]   and teacher for these principles to these young men?
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.200]   Again, thank you very much.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.920]   - Well, it's a good question.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.200]   I mean, certainly young men as a demographic
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.480]   are often in this day and age hungry for guidance.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.360]   So it is a demographic group that is open
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080]   to being inspired, open to being guided.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440]   And when they're not, when they're left adrift,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.920]   negative things happen as a consequence.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.280]   I'm glad you're involved in being a guiding light
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.660]   to this particular group.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.920]   I think one thing that's helpful,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.400]   so I'm thinking about, I mean, I advise,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200]   when I get messages from a lot of people,
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.680]   but when I'm thinking about the advice I give
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.700]   to young men in particular,
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.060]   I think having the frame of the deep life
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.020]   is a helpful starting place.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.080]   So saying, okay, you're committing to this goal
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360]   that you want to live a deep life.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.940]   You don't wanna live a life that is haphazard.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.640]   You don't wanna live a life that is arbitrary
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.560]   or at the whims of distraction
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.080]   or the noise of our culture,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   that you instead wanna live a life that is intentional
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   and considered and remarkable in the sense
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.960]   that it makes people turn their head
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.920]   and catch their attention.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.500]   Oh, that's something, that's something.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.080]   That is highly appealing to a lot of young men.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.280]   And I think laying out that framework,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.300]   okay, how do we do this?
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.280]   And making it clear that this is gonna require discipline
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.220]   and hard work, that is all fantastic.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.760]   That is a charge we want.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.320]   Give me a challenge.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.660]   I wanna have to rise to a challenge.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.960]   So that is all good.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   The other part of the deep life framework
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.240]   that I think is for good men,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   good for young men is that it has
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.220]   these multiple elements to it.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.220]   We often get stuck on just one aspect of good living.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.660]   We neglect the others.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.480]   We get obsessed about career,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.560]   but we fall behind on our philosophical
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.720]   or theological growth.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.000]   We fall behind on leadership or community.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.920]   Or we get really obsessed about theology.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.160]   We're going through the process of becoming a monk
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.360]   and forget the importance of community
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.440]   or the importance of craft.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.040]   So this notion that we have various areas of life
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.740]   that all require service, I think that is very useful.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.880]   And we know the areas I often talk about is craft.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.820]   So what you actually do and create is community,
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.880]   being a leader and sacrificing non-trivial time
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.400]   and energy on behalf of other people.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.880]   Constitution, that is your health, that is your fitness.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.680]   Contemplation, that's gonna be philosophy.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.760]   That's gonna be theology,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.200]   really making that important,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.560]   making that important part of your life.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.600]   And then I often do throw in celebration,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.800]   the ability to build up taste and kind of stewardship
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   and just gratitude for things that are good in the world
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.620]   and in your life and things you can go
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.140]   and just get pure enjoyment out of.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.760]   Breaking that down, here are five things.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.560]   Each of these requires attention.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.320]   Each of these requires cultivation.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.040]   Is a message that young people and young men in particular
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.280]   really resonate with.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   And then you work through,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.560]   let's do keystone habits in each
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   and let's go through each of these one by one
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.000]   and we can spend six weeks in each
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.320]   and do a preliminary overhaul of that part of your life.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.040]   Let's overhaul your eating
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.160]   and get some real serious fitness going here,
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.680]   have some discipline there.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.000]   How about your theological mind?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.040]   How about your philosophical mind?
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.000]   You need to start reading books.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880]   You need to stop, you can get off that phone.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.200]   You need to read, you need a half hour a day.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.720]   Here's what you're gonna read.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.800]   We're gonna talk about it.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.160]   You have to expand your mind.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.880]   You have to open, okay, there we go.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   We're working on that as well.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.740]   Leadership and community.
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.160]   What are you doing to make the life
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.680]   of people around you better?
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.200]   Are you spending time thinking about it every day?
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.320]   Do you lead anything?
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   Where are you leading other people
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   towards somewhere better
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.240]   where you're sacrificing your own time and energy?
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.320]   These things are important
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.720]   and it's all different areas you're focusing on.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.160]   When you focus on the craft piece,
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.280]   that's where deep work and concentration
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.120]   and focus and diligence and all of that comes into play,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.960]   slow productivity.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.340]   So as you move through these different buckets,
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.240]   these different areas,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   all sorts of different learning can happen.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.160]   But it's that overall pursuit.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.480]   I want with discipline and intention
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.360]   to make my life into something deep and remarkable.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.520]   That pursuit is like water
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.200]   to the explorer lost in the desert
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.220]   when we're talking about young men in today's culture.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.040]   So I think that's the way I would go about it
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.680]   and I would really challenge them in each of these areas.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.160]   Don't just do the easy, do the hard.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.380]   And I'll tell you, there are so many positive side effects
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.480]   of systematically trying to cultivate this life,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.680]   especially if you're young
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.340]   and especially if you're adrift.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.540]   The excessive video game playing,
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.520]   the excessive phone scrolling,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.000]   the pornography, the excessive drinking,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   all of these things that can afflict the 23 and adrift,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.160]   they naturally just start to dissipate
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.840]   when you have these more important things
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.240]   that you're starting to work on,
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.340]   you're getting that feeling of success on them,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.500]   you're getting that feeling of efficacy,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.440]   you're getting that feeling of autonomy and meaning,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.080]   and it transforms the whole way you think about the life.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.240]   It transforms the troll on the Twitter
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.120]   who's just angry and looking for attention
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.560]   into a leader in their town,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.840]   into a real deep thinker who ends up contributing
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.760]   something really interesting to the world of ideas,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.080]   to someone who is in good shape
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.520]   so they can be there for their family,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.200]   for their community through thick and thin,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.040]   into older age.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.400]   There's so many things good to come out of it.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.140]   So I'm glad you're thinking about this.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.060]   That's how I would do it.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.880]   Challenge, discipline, intention,
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.360]   all aimed towards the deep life.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.680]   Break into the categories, do my whole framework there.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.160]   I think young men are hungry for it,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.760]   and I think they will be quite receptive.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.200]   (upbeat music)
