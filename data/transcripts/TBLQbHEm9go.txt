[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   The Apostle Paul employs a startling phrase in 2 Corinthians 6, verse 10.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   He says, "Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing."
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.480]   It's startling because he's talking about his own testimony of rejoicing in sorrow, and those two experiences run
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.240]   consecutively in his life.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.360]   Sorrow and joy
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.160]   existed in his experience at the same time. It's simply a truism of life that
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.520]   good things and bad things are always happening to us all the time
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.200]   simultaneously in our lives. That's just normal Christian living.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.720]   Picking up from this point, here's Pastor John preaching in Vancouver in
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560]   2015.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680]   So we Christians are
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.120]   complicated people.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.040]   We should not
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.760]   think of all these calamities like you could add your personal calamity to my list. We shouldn't think of those as
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.840]   exceptional, like occasional.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.960]   Occasionally there's a calamity.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.320]   Are you kidding me?
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.120]   50
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.440]   million people die
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   in the world every year.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.760]   Five
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.520]   107 people die every hour.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.360]   95 every minute. Breathe in,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.760]   breathe out.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.280]   Four people have died.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.520]   Calamities are not exceptional.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.040]   They're just a breaking of the surface of the ocean of sorrow.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.360]   So we notice them a little more than what's going on right now in Vancouver as we speak in hospitals, in nursing homes,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   in hospice care.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.400]   It is utterly naive to think that there are good times and bad times.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.120]   Sequentially
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.560]   there are good times and there are bad times always all the time
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.720]   simultaneously.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.320]   And if you walk through the world with a heart ready to weep with those who weep,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:32.080]   ready to rejoice with those who rejoice, you will be a very strange and wonderful person.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.520]   So I want to I want to ask why do we have a world like this?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.160]   Why so much pain? Why so much
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.960]   conflict? Why so much suffering? Why so much death? It is a
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.800]   horrible place. It is a conveyor belt of corpses.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:00.400]   Millions of people right now are weeping their eyes out over the sorrows in their lives as we speak. Why such a world?
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.760]   Now before I go to the Bible and
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.240]   try to give you pointers for you to think about,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.160]   let me tell you something that I think I found very
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.040]   shocking when I realized it.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.320]   God has ordained in his mercy that
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.400]   sometimes
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.600]   very
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.640]   unbelieving people wake up to his reality because of pain not because of his absence.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.960]   For example,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.800]   suppose you're a professor in a university and you've absorbed a postmodern
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.680]   mindset that
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.800]   playfully
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.160]   says
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.200]   what's right for you is right for you and what's right for me is right for me and
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.360]   what's wrong for you is wrong for you and what's wrong for me is wrong for me and we don't impose our
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.520]   morality on each other. There is no one
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.800]   absolute right and wrong, good and bad, beautiful and ugly that gets squashed down onto our own
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.520]   perceptions and preferences. That's just rampant, right? It's just rampant and it is playful and it is
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.680]   gonna come to an end when that professor
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.960]   walks into a real living
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.720]   Holocaust himself.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.840]   So whatever the situation is he walks into an
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.720]   experience of six million Jewish people
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   murdered or
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.200]   60 million under the
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.480]   Stalinist regime
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.760]   starved and killed in the gulags or we celebrating a hundred years this year since the
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.040]   Armenian genocide of the Turkish people
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.760]   slaughtering a million and a half
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.720]   Armenians between Turkey and Syria in
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.240]   1915.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   You walk into that
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.160]   as a professor who's been playing word games on tenure
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:27.040]   with students fitting them to be destroyed by the world in which they live with this absolute nonsense
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.840]   that what's right for you is right for you what's wrong for me is wrong for me and suddenly he is so
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.920]   confronted by an evil he finds welling up out of his heart a statement he thought would never come that is evil.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.800]   And suddenly he he realizes what he just said.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.320]   He does not mean
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.840]   well, if you don't think it's evil, you don't have to think it's evil. You can think it's good.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.000]   He has just woken up from a dream world an academic dream world
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.360]   and he knows he has made a pronouncement of
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.160]   absolute significance
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.240]   that's evil.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.520]   That's evil and he knows he's a professor.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.160]   He knows and he realizes I have just broken every rule
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.920]   in my
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.640]   philosophy and
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.600]   I cannot deny what I am saying.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:33.120]   That's evil and I don't mean it's the result of chemical synapses popping in my
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.200]   evolutionary
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   primate brain.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.160]   I mean, it's real. I mean it has significance. I mean it is a moral reality. It holds for everybody.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.520]   This is not part of what I was thinking. This is evil and he knows
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.040]   pronouncements like that are meaningless unless
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.720]   there's an absolute and where do they come from?
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.120]   They come from God or nowhere.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.960]   You live a life of meaninglessness.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.760]   You're a bag of chemicals and electrical impulses.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.000]   It's moving in a kind of evolutionary
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.440]   movement of time and chance with no significance to your moral judgments whatsoever
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.160]   unless
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   God is.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.440]   It happens. In other words, it happens that in the midst of evil, evil
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.240]   becomes the very moment and means by which a person can awaken to the fact that we're not
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.400]   playing games.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.200]   We're not just
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   stuff.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.280]   It is a wonderful thing
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.760]   that God has mercy like that in the midst of such great
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.680]   evils.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   So here we are at my question.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.080]   Why
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.880]   such a world and we are biting off the biggest problem in the world. And so I just
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.840]   don't mean to claim to have the last answer with every
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.120]   strand neatly woven into a fabric of perfect knowledge. I don't
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.920]   mean that. I want to offer you
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.360]   glimpses of answers that are really here. I believe you can live by these and
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.840]   ask you to go home and consider whether these things are so like good Bereans in the chapter of
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.640]   chapter 17 of Acts.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.840]   So here's my first wrong answer.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.720]   The reason this world exists with its calamities and conflicts and suffering and death is because God is
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.640]   not in
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.400]   control. I've already rejected that there's no God. I'm just saying
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.280]   answer number two that's wrong,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   He's not in control.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.080]   He's looking down and
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.320]   it's wheeling out of control and
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.760]   there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.520]   That's not a true answer.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.600]   Some people opt for that answer it biblically it won't
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.400]   hold
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   for reasons like this.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:25.000]   Matthew 10 29 are not two sparrows so for a penny and not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.200]   apart from your father. That's a first century way of
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.960]   looking for the most random and
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:41.520]   insignificant event in the world and claiming God governs it. Are not two sparrows
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.160]   so for a penny and not one of those sparrows
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.000]   in the darkest
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.360]   forests of Papua New Guinea falls dead
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.000]   without God deciding that that happened.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:03.080]   It's just a little taste of an excellent sermon titled the pain of the world and the purposes of God preached in Vancouver on April
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.240]   26 2015. The whole message is available at DesiringGod.org right now. Go listen to it.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.720]   This clip came in from Nick in Savannah, Georgia. Thank you Nick for sending this in.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.680]   All of our clips are now crowdsourced. You tell us what bits of Piper's sermon has changed your life
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.840]   and we share that clip with the APJ audience. If you've got one email me.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.800]   Give me your name, your hometown, the sermon title, the time stamp of when the clip happens in the audio and
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.600]   tell me how it impacted you. Put the word clip in the subject line of an email and send it to me at
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.800]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. That's an email address. AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.880]   Speaking of mortality, cemeteries are unique places. They're somber.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.760]   Normally very quiet acres quarantined from the bustle of the city.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   For many, these are awkward,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.960]   uncomfortable places. Others are drawn to make regular pilgrimages.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.760]   And for those who do visit cemeteries, it raises the question of what are we seeking to accomplish in a grave
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   visit?
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.800]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we're going to be rejoined in the studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday for that.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   We'll see you then.
