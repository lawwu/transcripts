[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:58.520]   Hey, what's up, everyone? I'm Josh.

My name is Joshua. I am your host. I am your friendly financial philosopher. I am your fellow financial freedom fighter. Your fellow voyager on this incredible and exciting journey we call life with a special emphasis here on radical personal finance on finances, which touches every area of our lives.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:28.000]   Today, we answer a question from a listener who writes in and says, I'm currently facing a challenge. I face. I have about $10,000 in my 401k. And due to unemployment, I have accumulated $6,000 on a credit card debt. This is a result of my unemployment and also not paying attention at the right time. I didn't take your advice long ago. And so now the question is this. Should I take money out of my 401k in order to pay off my credit card? Is this a good idea?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:58.020]  , or should I take it out of my 401k in order to pay off my credit card debt?
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.020]   Well, I'm going to answer this question, of course, for this listener.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.020]   And my hope is that in answering for the listener, I'll be able to help this listener.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.020]   But my hope is also that if you're not in the situation, I can help you to think through this problem so that you can help other people who are in the situation.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.020]   Unemployment is very frequently a major, major cause of stress, financial stress especially. And that financial stress can have long lasting effects. And so I want to help you to help other people who are in that situation.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.020]   And so I want to help you to help other people who are in that situation.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.020]   And so I'm going to answer this question.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   The most common focus in answering this question that people have is to say, if you take money from the 401k account, you're going to pay a 10% penalty tax plus your ordinary income tax rates. And that is true.

[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   By my estimation, paying 10% penalty tax on the money is a good thing.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   By my estimation, paying 10% penalty tax on the money is a good thing.

[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.100]   But I do think that usually we should be very slow to take money out of things like 401ks and IRAs,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.100]   Especially if our reason for taking them out is because of unemployment.

[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   The first thing when you're facing a financial problem is to get very clear on the problem.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   What is the problem?
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   What is the actual problem?
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   This is very difficult for people who are facing emotional stress and turmoil to do effectively.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   Usually we need someone else to help us with it.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   So I asked this listener, what is the fundamental problem? Why do you face the problem? Frequently somebody who's experiencing emotional stress and turmoil to do effectively.

[00:26:37.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   The real answer is identify the fundamental problem.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   The real answer is identify the fundamental problem.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   For somebody who's unemployed, the problem is unemployment.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   The real answer is identify the fundamental problem. For somebody who's unemployed, the problem is unemployment.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   The problem is that cause. And so solve that problem first. While you're solving that problem, take whatever financial steps you need to take to stop borrowing and figure out how to live.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   Like I said,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   Like I said,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   take whatever financial steps you need to take to stop borrowing and figure out how to live.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   Like I said,

[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   Like I said,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   Like I said,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   like I said,
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:14.740]   has
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:33.960]   the, 100,
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   It's much better to do that than to wind up three months from now owing $4,500 in credit card debt on apartment rent that you didn't have the money for. So work on solving that problem and take whatever financial steps you need to do quickly. Go and apply for food stamps quickly. Go to the local food pantry. Get food from the local food pantry quickly. Go to beans and rice right away quickly.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   It's possible.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:30.600]  obediently, government programs, church programs, it's all over the place. So use those resources. Don't borrow money. Once you solve the problem of the unemployment and have the income, then we go back and work on the next problem. First thing I would do in those circumstances is build up some reserves. A few thousand dollars because you never know when that job may go away again. Build up a thousand, couple thousand, three thousand dollars of reserves and then start cracking at that credit card debt.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.120]   So,
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:31.180]   So,
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:31.280]   So,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:31.320]   So,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:31.340]   So,
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:31.340]   So,
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:30:01.360]   So, I hope thinking through this is helpful if you're in the situation. I hope thinking through this is helpful if you're helping someone else and I hope that by thinking through this you'll be motivated the next time you face a financial shortfall to avoid putting yourself in the situation. I hate credit cards.
