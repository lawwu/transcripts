[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Humans are fascinated by violence and you've got to ask yourself. Why is it the rash guard? Yes
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.120]   And I talk so much shit that I'm like man if I lose this is gonna be rough
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.240]   You're learning this shut the fuck up. I got you man. You were powered by McDonald's and Coca-Cola
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.200]   I want more and then I smacked him and he didn't want to fight anymore
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:28.240]   If George St. Pierre and Khabib Nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   I
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.240]   Am here with three individuals
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.880]   Each of whom are considered by many to be the greatest of all time in each of their respective disciplines
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.740]   The greatest MMA fighter of all time George St. Pierre the greatest martial arts coach of all time
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.200]   John Donahue and
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.960]   the greatest submission grappler of all time
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.680]   Gordon Ryan
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.040]   So let me ask the first question you guys didn't see the question no preparation here
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.840]   What is the key to your success each of you one thing or multiple things that come to mind?
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.760]   John go first
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.320]   Is it the rash guard
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.040]   Yes, I
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.440]   Like that you choose John right off the bat seem the most nervous
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.400]   Give the right answer for me. It's about
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.680]   Finding a way to work in
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.880]   a world where
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.400]   Most of the answers are already known
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.240]   Okay in any developed sport
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.840]   by the time you enter that sport most of the basic precepts through the
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.080]   the major techniques that the major mechanical understandings of the sport are long since worked out and so
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   in a highly developed world
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.120]   The key to success is to be able to identify
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.720]   Some area of the industry that you're in which is currently undervalued
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.680]   To do what the other people are not doing
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.480]   deeper than that you're you're
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.720]   Everyone has a view of okay. These are the the main skills of the industry I work in
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.680]   at any given time
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   some set of skills
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.160]   attributes
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.920]   Will always be somewhat undervalued they're underappreciated by the people in the game
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.440]   You see that at any in any given industry there are always trends which change
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.120]   The nature of the industry over time so
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.520]   fashion trends in the clothing industry, you'll see at any given time there's a
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.680]   General wave of fashion which pushes most of the people in the industry in a given direction at a given time
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.840]   What makes people stand out is the ability to look at the various possibilities out there and say here is something which is genuinely?
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.360]   useful, but which is currently being underused underutilized and I want to bring that back in and
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.000]   develop it and
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.400]   Because it's an inherently useful product
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.520]   It will be very very successful in its initial applications against people who aren't currently using it
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.920]   If you can do this in whatever industry you're in I believe you'll be highly successful
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.120]   so this implies both for actual specific like techniques and
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.600]   the also tactics as well in the case of
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.480]   Jiu-jitsu so for example in my sport leg locks have always been around okay?
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.440]   There's there's no shortage of people you can look back in history who are applying leg locks
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.200]   nonetheless as in across the industry
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.560]   Leg locks were undervalued and underappreciated. There was a general sense in which most of the leading figures of the sport
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.320]   for most of the history of the sport of jiu-jitsu tended to de-emphasize leg locks and
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:15.600]   When I looked at them I said there was immense potential, but it wasn't being realized and needed to be changed
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.440]   Since then that has more or less occurred now most people coming into the sport understand that leg locks are an important
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.840]   Aspect and they're no longer undervalued if anything it's gone too far the other way and now perhaps they're a little overvalued
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.480]   and the
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.200]   this kind of
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.160]   fashion trend exists in every industry and
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.480]   The job of anyone who wants to excel in a given industry is to be able to identify
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.240]   okay, what are the things that are currently out of fashion and undervalued and then
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.520]   Look at what is their actual objective value and then work?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.720]   To to to bring them back to the forefront so John brought up fashion
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.120]   George is wearing a really sexy shirt so
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   Assuming that's not the reason is there
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.160]   Is there something that comes to mind as the key to the success of your incredible career?
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.840]   Well, of course everybody knows the famous answer that every athletes are saying. Oh, it could be genetic
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   I was maybe gifted that certain predisposition. I worked really hard
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.680]   but I think
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.360]   Something that people don't talk enough is when everybody sometime go, right? I
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.960]   Was never afraid to try to go left and I felt many time trying to do things that were not
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   Known to be things that would bring me brought me success, but I tried it, you know
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   I was very often. I was the first of trying new things and I felt many time but certain times
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.480]   it gave me a certain advantage and
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.360]   for example, I
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.920]   was sometime fighting guys that had much better wrestling background and than me on paper and
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.600]   nobody before that fought those guys never nobody had dare to try to
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.280]   Take them down because their wrestling pedigree were so good
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.200]   And I didn't have on paper that wrestling pedigree to take these guys down in a fight
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.720]   but when everybody
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.560]   Tried to go right I was going left I fought them in a different way and that was
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.680]   The blueprint to beat certain some of these guys, you know, I mean, you know what I mean?
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.720]   So yeah, so we'll actually talk about a few fights where that you did just that this is fascinating
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.520]   But let's say at the high level. So Gordon again sticking on fashion may I compliment your
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.120]   Incredible badass hat trying to fit in here
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.360]   We should say we're in Texas now, so he's
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.600]   Become a Texan overnight. So what is there something you can speak to that you would attribute to as the key to your success?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.640]   yeah, so first of all, it has to be a rule where you don't ask us all the same questions because
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.640]   How am I supposed to compete with the answer John just gave
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.880]   There's nothing I can do that's gonna top that. Yeah, but uh, I think it's uh,
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.120]   There's many things but I think the number one thing is just is John
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.640]   When I came in I was a blue belt and I was beating brown and black belts in competition already
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.880]   But he really changed my way of thinking about the sport
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.840]   I would just come in and if something wasn't working
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.480]   I would just do it harder and faster and more aggressively and that just degenerated me into a degenerated into
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.160]   me spastically knee sliding into cross Hashi Gourami against Eddie Cummings for six months and then just getting heel hooked repeatedly and
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.400]   I'm like, this is not working and Eddie like when I met him was like a chubby
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.760]   Librarian looking guy and I'm like there's no Mike six to like a jacked like 170 and I'm like there's no way I'm losing
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   To a guy who looks like this, but he just kept heel looking me
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.880]   So I would just go harder and harder and it wouldn't work and then John's like well
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.320]   If you learned leg locks, you might you might have some more success and then I was like, yeah, that probably makes sense
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.760]   And from then on I kind of just changed the way I thought about the sport instead of doing doing things harder
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.540]   I would actually try to get better at your jitsu. You remember like a turning point where
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:19.320]   you became as opposed to being mediocre not just in technique, but an approach to
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.920]   - great
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.040]   I think it was somewhere around brown belt level when I was training
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.840]   Consistently started training full-time with John when I was purple belt mid-level purple belt and towards the end of my brown belt
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.200]   Days, I was beating up like legitimate like a DCC champions in the gym
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.600]   So I think like brown to black belt was a big thing for me
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.840]   And then when I won my first EBI and I was I submitted Yuri who won a DCC and I beat roost them
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.360]   So I think that was like my turning point as a competitor
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.800]   But I think I started to to reach world level a little bit before that
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.160]   I think somewhere around brown belt mid-level to late level brown belt
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.080]   It was some of that mental like it was there a moment when you like after a training session
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.020]   You realized I can actually do this. I could be at the top of the world
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.400]   I'm your class the critical moment for me was when I think it was right
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.960]   Right when I got my black belt, maybe a few months before I got my black belt
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.000]   we had a former ADCC champion come into the gym and
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.640]   we did a hard round together and I think I submitted him like four or five times and
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.400]   No one knew who I was
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.100]   I never won anything up into that point and I was like, okay
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.580]   Like if this is like one of the best guys in the world and I could submit him multiple times around
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:39.240]   I think that this is like something that I actually could do professionally and make a make a career out of this
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.280]   Okay. So the actual performance was the like you don't need to believe before you could perform like a lot of
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.800]   Olympic gold medalists
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.040]   they
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:56.520]   They have to believe before they can perform because like they're getting their ass kicked for a long long long time
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.280]   Yeah, I think but the best way for me to believe in something is to have repeated success doing it against high-level guys
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.600]   Like I'm not gonna just believe I can do a double leg if I can't a double leg on anybody
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.280]   So for me the the belief came from the repeated success in the gym
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.280]   Yeah, but to get to the point where you're submitting somebody like Yuri Samoa is like one of the greatest grapplers ever
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.080]   It's like a long journey
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.580]   Yeah
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.240]   But I had the confidence I had the belief in myself because of the success that I had in the gym
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.360]   Prior to that got it
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.880]   Even and it's one step at a time first. It's the Brown Bells. Then it's the black belts and it's world-class. Okay
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.240]   George was there a turning point for you when you you thought like I can actually do this
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.220]   Yes, I I always dreamed to become champion
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.560]   But I think the turning point that there was there was two turning point
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   And there were my two losses
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:54.640]   First my losses to Matt Hughes I went into that fight
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:03.600]   Just to not lose I was not fighting to win and it's after the fight when I watched the
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.000]   The replay of the fight I realized I was like I was doing pretty well
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.920]   But during the fight in my own mind, I was not seeing it that way
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:20.080]   I thought I was getting dominated by you was like a hundred percent when I watched the replay I
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:27.080]   Was like man, I can I can beat this guy. I was beating him until I made that stupid mistake
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.800]   so I was very frustrating but but
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.720]   That's what gave me the mentally the the championship level
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.800]   mentality and then I became a little bit overconfident because I start beating everybody after that and
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.520]   I
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.160]   Start to believe the hype of people when they look at me. They were like, oh, he's the new up incoming
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.120]   superstar and he's gonna be unstoppable and and then when I became champion, I I
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.560]   lost to to to Matt to Matt Sarah, so
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.200]   before I I believe
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.120]   my first failure was because I had a lack of confidence and
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:17.160]   And my second failure was I was because I was over confidence, so I think it's there's a perfect
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.840]   Center of confidence. I mean, I mean it's good to be confident because I like John taught me like confidence
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.400]   It's it's like money in your bank account if you you can have all the skills in the world, right?
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.880]   and and if you're if you don't have the confidence, it's like you it's like you can
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.840]   You can be a millionaire, but you don't have access to your bank account
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:44.000]   So it's that's a little bit the analogy that John told me so that's how I feel a confidence plays for an athlete
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.880]   But to be overconfident, I think it's always good to to be aware to be afraid of
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:56.040]   What can happen so to have a perfect balance of confidence and fear to me?
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.600]   That's what mentally gave me the edge to become I believe successful in my sport
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.200]   Playing off that John gave me a speech one time and he was like you have to be able to
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:14.080]   like flip a switch and turn it off where like a guy like Mayweather or someone who goes out who's super confident and
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.660]   He plays the character of someone who's like no one can beat me
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.040]   I'm the best that there ever was and and that's it
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.320]   But if you look at me actually trained very hard
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.680]   You can't you can't play the persona of no one can beat me and have it translate into your life
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.640]   And you think that you're so good that you don't have to do anything and no one could ever beat you
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.720]   You have to be able to play that public persona of no one could beat me
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   But then you have to actually do the training to make that happen
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.960]   You can't just you can't believe your own hype and say say that you know
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.080]   I can just do whatever I want
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.560]   No one's ever gonna beat me if the able to switch between the persona and the actual athlete and that made a big difference for
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.560]   me it's tough because
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:54.160]   like you're you you dominate such a large fraction of the world in in grappling and
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.440]   The George to just the perfect dominance after those two
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.600]   It's hard for the confidence not to just
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.720]   Like how do you avoid the confidence not becoming a thing that weighs you down where you completely
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.160]   deludes your mind
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.120]   For me, it's just well number one the guys in the gym are so tough
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.400]   So the guys in the guys in the gym that I train with are always like nipping at my butt and always giving me new
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.440]   New problems to solve and for me, it's really just about trying to learn new stuff over time
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.200]   So that keeps it interesting for me and it's not really about
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   You know, no one could beat me I don't have to train or have to do it
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.320]   I could do whatever I want
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.360]   It's more
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.640]   What keeps me in the gym is more about the fact that I'm learning new stuff all the time and working on something new and progressing
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.880]   to new levels at all times, it's not I don't just come in and do the same thing over and over again and
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.400]   That gets boring. You just come in and you don't learn anything new and you just do the same stuff for years at a time
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   And okay, okay
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:50.840]   This is boring
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.040]   But when you have new stuff to work on and new goals short term and long-term goals to reach then it makes it interesting
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.760]   it's a
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.640]   For me, it's a little bit like Gordon says is the fair because sometime in the gym
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.400]   I even before I when I was competing I was I was getting my butt kicked
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.960]   But I don't care what happened in the gym
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.800]   I mean it hit my ego, of course because I'm a proud person
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.880]   I'm a competitor even in the gym, but it's not a malicious competition
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.620]   Competition in between each other when you fight you have to be malicious you go there to hurt the guy
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.560]   but it it hit it hit me in terms of my pride when I get
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.520]   beat in a gym, of course, but
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.240]   that fear
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.560]   That I don't want it to happen in public
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.640]   especially not during a fight that what keeps help me keeps the balance between confidence and and and
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.040]   Fear, you know what? I mean? It's kind of weird. It's a mix
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.080]   It's a mixture of both that I believe I to me
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.300]   Help me
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:57.260]   Succeed to have the right mindset to fight and I talk so much shit that I'm like man if I lose this
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.480]   This is gonna be rough. So yeah, you put a lot of I mean
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.920]   That's that's the hard thing to do when you talk shit when you when you play the heel is
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:13.120]   So much to perform the pressure is I mean you have to be good under pressure. It's the Conor McGregor thing
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.100]   You know, the reason I actually started talking shit was actually like indirectly because of George
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   because because I will become the opposite of George I won I won my first EBI and I
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:32.020]   didn't talk shit and everyone was like being like, oh, you know, you only beat Yuri because because he was tired or
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.880]   You know this or that and if they have a rematch under any of the rules that he would have lost
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.320]   And I'm like trying to figure out what I'm gonna do
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.800]   So I'm scrolling through George's feed one day and he posted a clip of him beating someone and I look at the comments that I'm
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.560]   With this in mind. I'm like George is the nicest person of all time. And if you look at the comments
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   it's like 10,000 comments and like
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:59.180]   9,000 and 900 are just people calling him like all you do is lay and pray you pussy you suck
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:05.300]   You can't finish anybody and I'm just I'm looking at this and I'm like people are gonna say what they're gonna say regardless
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.320]   They're gonna talk shit regardless. So you may as well just say whatever you want and then just be yourself
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.600]   Is there some aspect that's I mentioned Conor McGregor?
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.400]   He uh, he crossed the line with Khabib
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.120]   At least in the eyes of Khabib. Is there something you ever
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:26.120]   Regret about crossing a line or does that you ever feel like there's a line or do you just keep pushing the line?
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.200]   Uh, I basically play it per per person
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:36.920]   I just I basically fire back with like one step above what what they do. It's always plus one. Yeah. Yeah, okay
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.760]   So I go I usually go hard like they fire a bullet then I drop a Duke
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.480]   And then and then after that initial shot and we go back and forth and I'll just keep one upping them
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:53.800]   So, you know, there's a lot of people that love you, but there's also a lot of people that love to hate you. Yeah
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.720]   so
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.560]   like what do those people like energize you or do you just
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:05.320]   Or is it funny to you? Like what as an athlete as a performer? You should not think about them
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.520]   It's like a fun thing
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.760]   It's like it's just like a fun thing that keeps me occupied
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.600]   Like because like because most of them that like talk shit. They like just say stuff that's factually incorrect
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.560]   So then I just argue with like actual statistics. Yeah, it's just like
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.080]   You suck or you're not gonna beat this person. I'm like I've already submitted that guy
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.400]   So I just it riles them up and it's just it's just a fun thing for me to do my my downtime
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.920]   Yeah, your responses are usually very factual very scientific. I appreciate
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.760]   Thank you. You actually you start by talking trash, but then you respond with science. Yeah, it's great
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.560]   Okay, it's good mix. That's a good mix. I
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:49.200]   Mean a topic of haters are more specifically sort of doubts within yourself or doubts around you as you're coming up
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.320]   Maybe George you can comment. I would just think ignoring John completely in this conversation. I
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:01.360]   Was gonna ask you another question, but let me just ask you on this on this topic
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.080]   Are there times in your life yet?
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.440]   You were surrounded by people that doubted you all the time
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.400]   And so what is there something you could say as in by way of advice how you overcome?
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.920]   The doubt either yourself or others around you all the time
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.280]   The first time I
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.920]   Manifest my desire to become a professional mix martial art athlete. Everybody doubt me
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.480]   Just not even I'm not talking about the UFC just to become a professional fighter
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:37.040]   Everybody doubt me and I became a I became a professional fighter. I had few amateur fight
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.260]   I won them all then I fought my first fight in
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.560]   Montreal I won and I became a professional
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:51.440]   Then I I told people that I wanted to fight in UFC. Everybody doubt me again. So it's a normal thing
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:59.300]   So I work my way up beat a few guys. Then I at the time Pete spread was
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.320]   just not knocked out Robbie Lawler with leg kick and
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.520]   The person was my agent at the time did a great move
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.760]   For me, so he brought Pete spread in Montreal to fight me Pete spread came to Montreal
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.360]   I and I believe
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.640]   He didn't know who I was
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.600]   So he thought that he was coming to collect an easy paycheck and I and I end up beating him
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.800]   So that gave me the opportunity to fight in UFC
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.920]   Then after I was in UFC, I wanted to become champion of the world, you know
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.560]   but Matthews was there and he seems invincible at the time, so
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:38.600]   Everybody doubt me again, and I became world champion. And after when you when I was well chairman, I wanted to be I
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.800]   Was competing against other world champion of other weight class
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:50.840]   For the title, you know for the legacy and everything so it's not no longer competing against my opponent
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   I was you know as a competitor
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.680]   You always you never wanted to be you never want to be satisfied because when satisfaction is the death
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:06.400]   You know when you're satisfied you better retire because it's over so always I have to find motivation what you can have more
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.600]   I want more don't be satisfied in life. So I wanted to be
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.720]   Like the best, you know, I was I was competing, you know
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.360]   I like to become the best and and you know
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:25.360]   Of course that people doubt doubt you all the time every time you say something that it's outside of the norm of the normality
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.880]   I don't want to say there's nothing normal, but I'm talking about
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.120]   when you you manifest your desire to do something that
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   takes
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.560]   Special attribute to to to succeed or that is something that is hard to to do
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.960]   It's for sure. You're gonna always have people that doubt you. It's so strange that people don't
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.360]   They don't lean into supporting like people that love you, too
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:55.240]   yeah, even people that love me used to doubt me and I believe I you need to use that as a
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.280]   Positive positive thing as a motivation to prove them wrong
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:05.560]   Yeah, so for me that that was the thing when someone doubt me nothing gave me more
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.600]   There's more energy because I want to prove him wrong
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.520]   I want to look at him in the face and say hey, you see I got you man. I did it
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.960]   so
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.320]   John do you ever use this in one way or the other by saying I don't think you can do this to motivate them to
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.120]   prove you wrong or
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   more general question of
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.760]   You know the mental toughness required to achieve or confidence required to achieve greatness
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.440]   Like what's your role as a coach when you have these two athletes with regards to your first question?
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.560]   Would I ever say to someone you can't do this as a kind of reverse psychology?
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   I know
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:53.880]   My job is to prepare people first and foremost with their skills and as Gordon pointed out earlier if you're
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:01.240]   In any way a rational human being and you're noticing that you're getting tremendous success
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.140]   with a given move in the gym against high-level opponents who
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.960]   Give a good read on what your actual opponent and a competition is is like
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.100]   you would have to be a moron to
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:19.040]   Not recognize that kind of success and say this is something I should be building into my game
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.560]   And you will carry the confidence that you earned in the gym into the arena
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.760]   So I never try to use reverse psychology. I build up
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.600]   Everything I do in terms of confidence is to give people physical skills
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.560]   I know people say all this physicality on the one hand is mentality on the other and confidence is
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.960]   squarely in the the mental aspect of the game, but all the underpinnings and
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.000]   beginnings of confidence of physical
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.640]   okay, a rational human being will see where they're having success and where they're having failure and confidence will
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.880]   Surround those areas where they're having success and will degenerate in cases where they're having
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:10.280]   Failure, so my job as a coach is to set them up for success in the gym with a given set of skills
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.840]   And I don't have to do anything
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.240]   psychologically after that I just
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.280]   If I can set you up to be highly successful
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.040]   With a given move or a set of tactics ten times in a row against quality opposition in the gym
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.120]   I don't have to do a damn thing when it comes to instilling confidence. I
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.320]   Will tell people hey, you're doing a really good job with that move. It's working well for you
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.560]   but
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.400]   When they not an agreement, I'm not trying to force anything on them
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.640]   They're recognized they or they already recognize that long before the words came out of my mouth
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:51.960]   But on the other hand intelligent rational people will recognize when they're failing with given moves and no amount of talk on my part
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   Can ever change that?
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.160]   if I teach Gordon a
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.320]   given arm lock and
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.200]   15 times in a row he tries it over a month and all 15 of failures
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.080]   There's nothing I can say verbally to come up to Gordon say hey, you're really good at that move
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.560]   He's gonna look at me say bullshit
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:15.400]   I'm terrible at it and that will create a crisis of confidence where Gordon no longer believes the words coming out of my mouth
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:22.120]   So I will never compromise that but isn't there a line you just said 15 there you have to believe
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.840]   that
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:30.040]   Doing this arm lock 15 times over a period of a month is worth it because eventually you might get it
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.960]   Thank you. Yeah, that's a separate issue that that's a separate issue that
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:44.560]   There are times where I've more or less pushed athletes to go in a certain direction for example
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.520]   When I first met Gary Tonin, he never had a guillotine
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.480]   Strangle and I I would say don't carry, you know
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.280]   You're a scrambler like one of the greatest weapons a scrambler can ever develop as a guillotine
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.760]   like it should be in your arsenal and
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.520]   He was like, I just go for the back and I said well, there's gonna be a day
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.440]   You can't take someone's back and it's always good to better strangle from front and back
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.840]   Okay, of course, we all prefer a strangles from the back that makes sense
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.200]   But there's gonna come a day where it's gonna be useful for you
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.960]   and so that was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said you're learning this shut the fuck up and
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.120]   He like literally wouldn't teach him any anything else until he got a guillotine
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.720]   Yeah, Gary like asked him a question. He's like, let's say you're guillotine
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   And
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:36.400]   For the first three months as gifted as as Gary Tonin is and learning most moves most moves Gary gets it like
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.440]   in minutes there was something going on with Gary just couldn't get a guillotine on people and
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:49.560]   Finally after around three months, he started having some success until ultimately became one of his best weapons
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:57.920]   We had to go through like 15 different variations of guillotine until he found one which actually worked reliably for him and
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.640]   That was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said no
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.320]   Do you have to learn this the long search had to do more with the physical characteristics?
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.480]   I couldn't figure out the right look it made sense
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.600]   It made sense in the case of Gary Tony because there were more opportunities per minute of his grappling for guillotines
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.360]   That the investment in time was worth it for another athlete. I might have said well
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.680]   He hardly ever gets in the situation, but front head long so guillotine so it's not even worth
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.960]   investing the training time
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.680]   Let me ask you a question on the on the competition side mentioned haters
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:36.320]   And do you think about this aspect of the competition with athletes? It's a great question and the answer is no
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.960]   I'm
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.800]   You can see that you could you couldn't find two more polar opposites
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.080]   psychologically than George St. Pierre and
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.800]   this monstrosity on my left and
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:59.080]   I've I've never said to my athletes. Hey, I think this is the sort of demeanor you should carry yourself with
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.840]   I'm myself a very flawed
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.880]   Character, and I'm the last person on earth who should be delving out moral advice to other people
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.480]   the only thing is I
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.640]   You know, of course, I believe some things are off-limits
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.680]   But as long as it's done in the context of sport with no one's physically attacking people or do anything crazy
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:23.400]   Where it just goes completely over the top then I give almost zero
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.520]   Moral advice to my athletes. I'm a jujitsu coach not a preacher
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.840]   Next I if I can if I may
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.600]   We we are entertainers
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.480]   You know, we're athlete or professional athlete, but we make
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.960]   We make a living because of people or want to see us perform
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.440]   Same thing an actor same thing a singer and a lot of the time
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.520]   especially in the fight game
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:57.840]   An event is promoted it needs to be with emotion
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.600]   Love me hate me, but do not ignore me
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.280]   and
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.720]   you know it
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.520]   When it's authentic and in the it's done
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.560]   well, I think me my personally my my favorite fighters to watch are the one that are that that
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:21.680]   Have a sort of some sort of a bad persona. I really enjoyed watching those guys because
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:27.040]   They bring it an emotion element into a fight, which is great. You know, I
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:33.520]   Feel to me it's more interesting to watch when there is an emotion involved and I believe that's why
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.080]   Some fighters make more money than others, you know, you know what?
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.560]   I mean, that's the reason why we can make a living out of this
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:47.600]   Yeah, they're better entertainers, but you're right. The authenticity seems to be really important. There's actually something very interesting there
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.520]   It's time to break out some some secrets
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:57.640]   You know who like you think of George St. Pierre you think of like the highly technical polished
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:05.360]   Martial artists, do you know who his favorite fighters to watch were?
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.240]   You'd probably be thinking of probably someone who's really technically advanced
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.360]   Actually, it was Mark Coleman
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:20.680]   Kevin Randleman and Phil Barone. He used to love watching that was a hammer house. That was his favorite
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.680]   he would love those guys and
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.320]   whenever their flights were on George we watching the hammer house crew and
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.360]   It's funny what you said about how those guys bought an intensity to
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.120]   To MMA that was off the charts. Have you ever met those guys in?
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.200]   and in their prime, let me tell you it was it was something to behold and
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.160]   I had this crazy larger-than-life
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.400]   Personality that most of the things I did made no sense whatsoever
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:56.000]   But I mean technically but that was their appeal and and there were these guys and George loved to watch them more than anyone else
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.440]   You never knew what what could happen with these guys. I remember when Mark Coleman won the pride Grand Prix
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.800]   I was in my living room. I was jumping. I was so happy. I was like, yeah
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.440]   He beat Igor Varchevchin. I was like
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.600]   Like to me, it was amazing. You know what I mean?
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.800]   Because of the emotion that they brought into the fight. George is actually very
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.520]   Interested by something you said there normally when I
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.360]   Ask what is the appeal of a given fighter?
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:32.120]   And what makes people watch a fight you you talked about the idea that fighters entertainers and that's absolutely correct that they are
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.840]   it's this weird weird industry where you're you're
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:42.800]   Both an athlete and an entertainer and you need to be successful in both regards to become
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.240]   financially successful insofar as
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:54.000]   Your favorite athletes to watch at least were people who are almost like the polar opposite of who you are
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.720]   I've always said that most people if you look at
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   Say a million people watch a pay-per-view event
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.640]   What percentage of those million people have a genuine?
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.200]   Technical understanding of what's happening as they watch a fight
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.960]   It's tiny
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:23.160]   It's absolutely tiny the vast majority of people who watch a professional fight have almost no
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.960]   Technical understanding of what's going on in front of them. So how do they relate to the fight?
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.480]   What's the only way they can?
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.800]   It's through emotion. And
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.640]   So when they get a sense that these two don't like each other
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.200]   Then they can relate to the fight
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:46.320]   But only a tiny percentage of people watching a given professional fight can relate to it on a technical level
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.440]   The overwhelming majority will always form an emotional attachment to the fight
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.160]   That's why when you see things shows that UFC primetime. They never focus on
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.280]   tactics and the techniques of the fight they focus on the emotional elements the
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.200]   Preparation the view of their own family members as athletes get ready
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.240]   It's always an emotional pull
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:12.880]   Because that's how 99% of the viewers relate to the fight if I haven't think about chess
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:17.280]   Okay, if I have minimal knowledge of two world champions
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.440]   Coming to fight each other in it or match up against each other in a game of chess
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.320]   I know so little about chess tactics, and I can't really form any kind of technical
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.200]   Appreciation of what's going on on the board?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.520]   But if you tell me that these two chess players hate each other's guts and they've got a rivalry which goes back five years and
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.680]   They've said this and that about each other in public then suddenly I might is break up and I'm like, oh, okay
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   This sounds interesting
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:51.560]   Because I just don't have the knowledge to appreciate what's going on on the board and a chess game to be able to
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.000]   to appreciate the
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.880]   technical nuances of what they're doing so any
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:03.000]   Interest that I have in the chess match is going to have to come from some kind of emotional level because I'm just not qualified
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.440]   To make technical assessments and that's exactly how it is in the case of both grappling and mixed martial arts
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.200]   That's why the ones who evoke the most attention are always the ones who can form some kind of emotional appeal
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.840]   Conor McGregor was the all-time master of this. I
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.480]   believe also
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.920]   Emotion can be used as a weapon
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.680]   For example, I've learned I've learned this from my favorite boxer is Sugar Ray Leonard
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:34.480]   Sugar Ray Leonard, I remember I was very young so I I watched his fight later when I was older
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   But I know that sugar Ray Leonard
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.080]   Was the best boxer of his era?
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:46.920]   To me personally and I don't think nobody could beat him. I think it was skill skill wise. It was the best. However
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.280]   When he fought in Montreal Roberto Duran
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.600]   Roberto Duran
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:01.800]   Made it in a way that Leonard became very emotional he wanted to stand in front of Duran and
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:08.080]   fight a different fight that that he normally does because he wanted to show that he's a man and
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.400]   He lost that fight which was a mistake
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.840]   so by by
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:21.200]   Then later on he beat Roberto Duran in quite easy, you know, the the fair that you know, everybody remembered a no-mask thing
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.440]   but my point is
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.760]   Emotion can be used in a way that it can make your
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:35.640]   Derail your opponent out of his game plan and I felt a lot of my opponent trying to do that with me
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.960]   So that's why I never got involved. That was my way to defend myself against
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.700]   some kind of bullying to put like a like a shield in front some other guy like
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:53.600]   Gordon he expressed himself differently. Of course, there's a language barrier, but for him he's better at
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:36:01.520]   Giving giving giving back that says he's a better counter-attacker. You know, that's the way you respond to to to the aggression of
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:09.120]   Of an emotional attack. I think everybody is different in that regards. What's interesting that John said that he doesn't
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:16.880]   Study the tactics of this game or maybe you're not interested in the tactics of this game
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.040]   Because it seems like this is more than just being an entertainer. It seems like it could be an effective part of the match
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.480]   Yeah, I just feel like whatever investment you make in that is
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:33.520]   It's going to get negligible rewards first of all, it's probably any kind of pertain to one match in front of you rather than the
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.520]   totality of your career and
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.640]   Whatever gains you get out of psychological trickery and play
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.800]   Typically
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:50.640]   Don't last long you've raised an excellent example with sugar Ray Leonard he did fight outside of his usual
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.140]   manner in that regard but rather than me try to tell someone hey
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.520]   Behave like this before a fight
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:04.720]   I would have been probably more forceful between rounds with an athlete and saying you're fighting this fight the wrong way
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   And that would have a much
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.040]   more
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.040]   beneficial impact on my athlete and
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.640]   Psychological trickery before a fight. I believe another example of
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.120]   Emotion that leads to failure is a
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:25.480]   Jose Aldo against Conor McGregor. I think it was it was on purpose that
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.360]   McGregor did this try to bait how though to become overaggressive to open in himself because he's an excellent counter puncher puncher
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.440]   That's what I believe in made a mistake
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.340]   There's another great one my match against cyborg
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.320]   2018 no gi worlds where he didn't even try to win
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.000]   he just like wanted to smack me in the face the whole time because he was so angry that I was talking shit to him before
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.320]   the match and
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.960]   It was like the finals of the absolute it was like the biggest
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.080]   Match of the weekend and he just didn't even try to pass my guard to do anything
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.200]   He just wanted to hit me in the face and I was like sick. I just won
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:06.840]   It was incredibly fresh. Yeah, that's seen to watch like a grown man sort of lose composure
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:13.560]   Gordon one thing I've always been very impressed with you and that's
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.680]   No matter how heated talk gets
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.600]   Before a match with you when you go out to grapple you're absolutely cold
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.080]   Like I've you've never gone into a match
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.840]   carrying anything other than just
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.400]   cold-blooded
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.960]   Calculation and you've always been able to separate very well
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.160]   the idea of words and deeds and I think that's always been one of your
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:46.240]   One of your strongest assets a way I often measure this is when a match is over
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.040]   I will ask the athlete questions about the match and
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.960]   If they can't answer the question, what were you doing in the fourth minute? Okay, what was that setup?
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:02.160]   He used in in the third minute that got you into the Kimura lock if they can't answer that that tells me
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:07.440]   They were just fighting on instincts and emotion, but with Gordon it's like a logbook
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.360]   It's like okay in the seventh minute you went for that
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.120]   Judy get on me set up from from on the left side
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.920]   What were you thinking? He can always give an answer. He's absolutely stone-cold
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.480]   Speaking of emotion
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:33.080]   Gordon you will potentially if you're healthy face Andre Galvao and the ADCC coming up super fight
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.720]   Who is Andre Galvao for people who don't know? Can you tell the story of your beef with?
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.680]   the the emotional interaction with a man, yeah, so uh
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.880]   Andre is a
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   He's considered the greatest
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.000]   ADCC competitor of all time
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   multiple time black belt world champion
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.400]   winningest ADCC champion every has six six gold medals and
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.600]   I've been trying to compete against him
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:05.080]   Pretty much forever like since I got my black belt in 2016. I've been trying to get matches with them
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.680]   he was in the first DBI that I did and he ended up pulling out and that I've been trying to get matches with him and
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.320]   He would always say no and give one reason or another and then
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:23.360]   After the last ADCC, I was like hey Andre said he was retiring after this after this
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:29.720]   This competition so if he wants to retire, you know, he's he's the greatest ADCC competitor of all time
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.780]   And I think it's great. But if he wants to compete and that's great. I was like super nice and then he started like
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.000]   posting like passive-aggressive Instagram
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.240]   Captions and
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:47.340]   Then we started going back and forth in the internet and there was like one point where I saw him in person when he
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.000]   Acknowledged he's like I understand like what you're doing
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.160]   Like we're gonna pump this fight up and he was like totally on board
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.680]   but then there must have been something that happened where like it changed from like him like going along with it to being like
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.960]   actually pissed and
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.920]   Then there was that one night of flow where I went to go shake his hand and he he flipped me off and then he followed
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.260]   Me backstage and started to try to fight me and then I smacked him and
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.540]   Then he didn't want to fight anymore. And then we've been going back. He's actually blocked me on Instagram now
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.040]   So he just won't engage no one from Atos will engage now
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.320]   But it's gonna be interesting how he how he shows up if he can keep it under control or not
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.900]   Do you think how do you explain that level of emotion? Is this fear of losing your throne?
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.540]   Is it or is it just a human being like with a cyborg just?
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:37.080]   Just becoming emotionally unstable. It might just be me. I just have a way to get get under people's skin
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:42.400]   It's just I don't know. He's he's he was he was cool for a while and then I just I don't know it just
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.960]   Then everyone gets like this. They're all so emotional by the time they actually step up to compete that it's pretty easy to read them
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:55.440]   They're either so emotional that they want to actually come forward and and beat me like like Tim Spriggs is a perfect example at ABCC
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.440]   I posted like
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.400]   On my story on Instagram like 10 minutes before a match
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:06.840]   I said like what I'm gonna do to Tim Spriggs is gonna be criminal and he's like a very stalling guy and he came
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.640]   He saw that and then he came out and actually tried to fight me like he came and actually engaged my guard and I ended
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.200]   Up submitting him
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.800]   So it either has that effect or it has the effect where?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.560]   They know I've talked so much shit leading up to the match
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.160]   That they're so afraid to lose that they just get super stalled and they move away
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.000]   So either has one effect with I come forward and they want to they want to beat me beat me or they want to just
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.480]   They're so afraid of getting submitted that they know if they engage they're super cagey and they just back away and don't really do anything
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.800]   Do you think this match happens?
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.680]   There's a lot of variables and what I have to see how my stomach is and to
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:44.720]   If I'm actually gonna show up and compete my stomach's healthy. I doubt that Andre will actually show up to compete
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.160]   I've been trying to compete against him for six years and he hasn't done it
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:54.360]   So there's no reason to think he would now is it possible for you to speak to where like your estimates are about your stomach?
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.240]   Or is it not too unclear for now?
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.800]   Still too early to tell I have this round of treatment that I'm doing until late February
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.440]   And I'm pretty sure that I need to do the same test
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.040]   They did initially to retest all my levels and then go from there
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.460]   So I've been feeling a little bit better like it's not nearly as bad as it used to be
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.880]   I was explaining to someone the other day like
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.200]   For the last four years
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.680]   I would be so nauseous that every time I would walk into a new room
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.640]   I'd have to actively locate a garbage can in case I have to throw up
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.960]   So I'm like one step above that right now. I'm like doing a little bit better than that
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.560]   So it's definitely getting a little bit better, but it's not it's not where it needs to be
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:36.240]   Can we talk about diet for just a sec because both of you George and and Gordon?
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:44.040]   Like suffered from stomach issues different kind and have arrived for now for different places
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.520]   So can you maybe George speak to?
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.920]   The general question of what is the best diet for performance for training?
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.320]   Like what have you learned through your career about this? Well, I think everybody is different
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.080]   to me personally
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.000]   I implement fasting
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.560]   Time restricted eating and
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:12.160]   Prolonged fasting. What's the longest you've done so far? The longest I've done is five days. You don't I do it quite often
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.480]   I do I do four time a year I do
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.280]   three to five days
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   water fast
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:25.320]   And I liked it. It helps me with inflammation. I think it boosts the immune system and
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:32.520]   That's about the I read papers about about this and I it helps me also feel
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:38.720]   Feel good. It's kind of a terrap very therapeutic to physical and mental just mental
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:46.000]   Mental and physical because when I eat my when I break my fast and I sit at the table with with other people
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.200]   It doesn't matter what I eat if we all eat the same thing
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:55.600]   I always tell them I said my food right now tastes better than all of yours, you know
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.720]   because I you know, I I have this
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:06.000]   thing that I think I believe sometimes you need to put yourself into suffering to realize how
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.400]   pleasurable something is and I
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.400]   Tent
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.360]   Personally like diet wise I eat whatever I want
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.560]   Whenever I want I don't I no longer have any problem with this
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.520]   but if I would have a competition coming up like
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.440]   Knowing that I what I know now about my body I would
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.040]   orient myself
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.520]   more towards an animal based diet
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   That's because I've tried different things and that's the kind of diet that I believe helped me
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.800]   Having less inflammation and feel better in terms of performance for for for doing something physical
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   So high protein high fat low carbs
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.920]   well
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:57.480]   This is is different between animal based diet and keto. I mean there is carbs. There is a lot of fruit
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:03.120]   I got a lot of the carbs from the fruit a lot of organs organs
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:09.600]   I know a little bit about paleontology and the passive
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.000]   About you a prehistoric human and and I I know that
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.840]   And not only about that I know because I've traveled certain place in the world
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:25.960]   I want to visit the Maasai in Africa the hunter-gatherer tribe and I know that when they kill an animal
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:31.520]   They go for the organs first and I know I pretty most predatory animal they do the same thing
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:37.440]   So organs I believe is something that normally in our culture in the western part of the world
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.120]   We don't really eat but it's something that is very nutritious
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.080]   Have you been able to convince Gordon to try fasting?
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.040]   Haha
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   Talk about diets
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.280]   It's a different situation. I think for Gordon because he's an heavyweight. He doesn't want to lose weight
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:00.240]   You know when a heavyweight the range of like my range was like I was a welterweight and middleweight, but heavyweight
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:06.720]   It's like some of the guys that you can compete can compete against their main there might be 300 pounds. So if you lose weight
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.560]   It's a it's a big problem. You know what I mean?
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:14.400]   So and there is things that will work for me that might not works for Gordon, you know
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.680]   So we have to make his own experience and I told Gordon sometime when everybody goes left
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:24.340]   You try to go right see how you feel with certain things experiment not not a topic
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.280]   That's part of your optimization
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:34.020]   Optimal performance formula. Well what I used to do before my stomach issues and for those of you listening who don't know
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.020]   I had recurring staph infections in
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:41.460]   2018 and I took a bunch of oral antibiotics and it just completely wiped out my stomach
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.840]   So I just was diagnosed. It was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.700]   So for those of you messaging me on Instagram who are just watching Rogan asking me about my gastroparesis. That's not what I have
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.320]   They misdiagnosed it and I did some other tests and for four years. I didn't even know what it was
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:01.180]   and then I got this I went to this doctor in California who
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:09.520]   Diagnosed me with I've H pylori and then a fungal and a bacterial overgrowth of my small intestines. So the issues in the small intestines
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.100]   so what I used to do was I used to do like
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.040]   seasons where I'd have a
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.460]   very clean season where I was competing and I would
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:22.160]   Have a lower body weight and I would do like an off season kind of like a bodybuilder where I would eat a lot more
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:27.520]   Food and a little bit dirtier food and I would have cheeseburgers and pizza at nighttime to have the extra calories
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.680]   But now I can't eat those foods because they upset my stomach
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.480]   So now I pretty much just try to eat whatever I can and maintain the weight the best I can
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.760]   Based around how my stomach feels so right now it's like rice chicken eggs
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   fish
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.640]   vegetables fruits and
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.760]   Pretty much nothing else like anything hard to digest
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:52.280]   Anything spicy red meat fast food all that's all that's hard for me
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.080]   Which sucks because in Texas things barbecue
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.920]   And I mean this diet is really important for you John I can tell
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.160]   Like is that something you think about for athletes at all again?
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.120]   That's part of the I've to be honest with you. I've never seen any
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.160]   measurable
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:20.920]   Improvement in sports performance in jiu-jitsu by change of diet. I do believe that diet is important for longevity in
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:25.400]   Human beings and I do think it makes a difference especially once you get past the age of 40
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   with regards longevity
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:34.520]   For older athletes. I do believe it makes it some difference, but my observation is in athletes and
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:40.440]   In their youth and working up into their prime. I've seen athletes have the worst
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.160]   diets
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.880]   God bless Travis Stevens, but that guy won an Olympic silver medal basically on McDonald's and candy. Yeah
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.920]   George st. Pierre for 80% of your career you were powered by McDonald's and coca-cola
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.600]   Tochino Freddo that was my yeah, my meal of choice before a championship fight
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.940]   Gordon for him his youth was just five guys hamburgers Gary Tonin same thing
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:11.960]   I've worked with Japanese judo players who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and won Olympic gold medals
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.240]   I've worked with Russian wrestlers who just ate
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:23.320]   Whatever was put in front of them and their athletic performance was outstanding
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.280]   I've worked with other guys who did have what would be considered a very clean diet and
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.640]   Their performance was no better than anyone else on the mat. So I've never
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:39.480]   I've never seen someone say okay. I changed my diet and because of that there was a measurable
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:47.600]   Improvement, you know in sports performance another way to phrase it though is I have noticed with a lot of lead athletes what they eat
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.040]   They begin to believe that that either is not a hindrance or it's actually good
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.840]   I Travis Steve is an example of somebody who eats shitty
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.860]   because he believes it's like it's like a power because
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.840]   Whatever, he's traveling across the world. He can't rely on healthy good food to be there
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.440]   So I'm going to eat shitty
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:14.840]   So that that's the like my body knows how to perform under whatever skittles or whatever. It's got McDonald's everywhere's got McDonald's
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   So that makes like and they've convinced themselves and you talk about Russian athletes. A lot of them have very
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.800]   strong beliefs about like this
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:32.480]   Particular food being good for them. There's no agreement among them. Exactly. No agreement. Yeah. Yeah, so believe is more important than the actual time
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.000]   Yeah
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   if I can after
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.600]   You know after a night out when you're hanging over I
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   Think the best thing and I'm saying this and also sincerity
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.940]   I think the best thing to eat to me was like like a cheeseburgers with
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:55.920]   We call that a puts in back home because it's very fat. It's greasy
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:02.000]   So it up so the next day when you wake up, I think you feel better because it absorbed the alcohol
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:10.560]   My mom told me the same story once and then I try I was like I was hungover for some party and
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.760]   I woke up. I was like probably I don't know 19 or 20. I woke up and
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:20.720]   My mom's like yeah, just have it have a cheeseburger go go eat go eat something greasy and I did and I was like
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.320]   I feel kind of better now. I do not know the science the exact science behind it
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:31.080]   but I always notice and I don't know if it's placebo, but I always notice that if I
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:35.140]   If I'm if I party hard and I've been drinking a lot
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.560]   If I don't eat before I go into bed if I don't eat shitty food
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:45.320]   Then I guess I will wake up and feel worse than if I eat shitty food. I feel better. I know it sounds crazy
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.880]   I don't know why but it works for me
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:55.000]   Yeah, but it's also hard to do science on extreme performers so the discussions we're having is amongst the very
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   You know that this might not apply to a general like recreational athlete, but for the elite
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.440]   I've just seen champions in every kind of combat sport and I've never seen a correlation between
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:13.280]   Dietary habit and performance and people under the age of 30. I do believe that diet is important for longevity. However, and
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.800]   For that alone that may well be worth investing time in it
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:24.440]   But with regards sports performance at least in judo - I've never seen any significant difference. Well, we had a little bit of a
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.400]   Difference of opinion on this I think
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:33.120]   What about strength training and muscle building or at least we had a discussion about this. So what do you believe is the value of?
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:39.440]   Of you know training outside of the sport so fitness
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.720]   Lifting heavy lifting explosive all kinds of lifting
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.960]   Do you leave personally for me? I believe and I've learned that from from John
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.240]   I used to do like
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:58.600]   To train like a bodybuilder before because I thought in my early days of competition
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:04.800]   That was the most efficient way to do things - because it was like I was watching Jean-Claude Van Damme
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.680]   Arnold Schwarzenegger we thought back back in the day. That was the thing
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:17.320]   That that's how we should do it, you know for to get ready for a fight, but I realized later on
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:22.040]   That it's all about efficiency and
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.960]   Some guys they don't lift at all and they're doing pretty well. So I
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.640]   Do cross training mostly for longevity?
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.240]   Well, it's mostly for a therapeutic
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.000]   Like a therapy it's more therapeutic than for performance
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.220]   It's to keep my body healthy to do a certain movement that are different than what I do every day in the gym in combat
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.220]   sport to keep me
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.760]   Healthy and
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.200]   Athletic so all the interesting movement stuff that you've done outside the sport that was for
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:55:02.120]   Therapeutic mostly therapeutic. I think it does it could trend trend transcend to performance, but it's mostly therapeutic
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   I do not believe that squatting
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:10.840]   Five plates or or bench bench pressing three plate will make me a better fighter
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:17.020]   I do not I believe actually it could hurt me more. It could damage me more than then benefit me
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.960]   so
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:25.040]   Gordon is somebody who on Instagram post a lot of pictures of you being shredded and huge
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.840]   What's the value of strength? So I do like a combination of?
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:37.560]   John got us big into like gymnastics type movements like toes to bar and muscle ups and things like that when we were young
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:43.580]   Like toes to bar because that's like the exact motion you have to do when you're retaining guarders needs to chest
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.080]   So I do a lot of that stuff
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.200]   in combination with I do a lot of
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.120]   Opposite of George I do a lot of bodybuilding workouts
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:58.680]   Where I do like a basic split like a chest and triceps back and biceps day and my idea is that?
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:08.200]   Weight lifting should always be a supplement to jujitsu so you shouldn't be missing a jujitsu session to lift weights
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:14.280]   So I don't do I do probably I train jiu-jitsu every day, and I lift three to four times a week
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.820]   I feel like lifting seven days a week for me is too much and the lifting takes a lot of energy when you do like
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.320]   Hard lifts like that
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   but my idea is if you want to get good at jiu-jitsu do jiu-jitsu and if you want to be bigger and stronger lift weights and
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.440]   and eat food and I
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.880]   Generally don't go super heavy when I lift you start putting crazy weights then start tearing muscles and stuff
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:42.580]   I'm so I usually do moderate weights with a very high rep rep range like four sets of 20 with a drop set at
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.920]   The end to fatigue the muscles break the fibers and grow
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.800]   Okay, so
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:53.960]   Four sets at 20 that's interesting so that's more for endurance and raw strength yeah, and also I think
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.040]   close to the competition I'll pick the intensity up and
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:02.120]   While there's no real way to get significant gains in vo2 max
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.600]   I think that lifting and just getting used to mentally redlining
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:12.460]   Gets me kind of in competition shape because a lot of times in jiu-jitsu the guys I'm training with
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.780]   They're not on a technical level where they can
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.700]   Physically exhaust me to the point where I feel like I'm gonna die
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:23.980]   But I get most of that like what I'm wrestling because I'm not as efficient in wrestling so I get a lot more tired
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:30.220]   And lifting when you do like if you do like four sets of 20 leg press to squat and you go back and forth
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.060]   Like you're like about to die at the end
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:37.100]   And I think I feel like gets me in the mental habit of redlining before competition
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:42.040]   But does muscle help you it's like the actual mass of muscle like this
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.640]   So I'm being stronger will always help and a combat will always help yeah
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:49.300]   To some degree it's not gonna be to a degree where?
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:55.360]   It overrides efficiency, but I think that they can't help being strong or can't hurt being stronger
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.200]   there's a bunch of people who believe depending on the sport that
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.080]   The strength can quickly become
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.680]   That have detrimental effects to efficiency
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.220]   Yeah, like I agree that certain kind
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:17.160]   I mean if strength is pure is like very cleanly purely applied to the exact movements of the sport so in judo the
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:24.520]   Explosiveness you need is very difficult to replicate in any kind of way except by doing judo. Yeah, I mean for us
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.600]   They always have to understand
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.720]   There's only so much
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:32.560]   Technique that can overcome a certain amount of strength like if we all try to fight a silverback gorilla
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.440]   It's gonna kill us
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:43.040]   But that that being said I do think that like for example heavyweights are usually the least technical because they rely on their size
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.040]   and strength to beat smaller people
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:50.400]   But I think that if you stay with us with the discipline of doing everything very precise
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.880]   And I train with a lot smaller people most of the time so I get out of the habit of using
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.160]   Using my strength. I think if you're very precise of the way that you train
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:05.560]   I think that the extra size and strength can help you quick question. How would you fight a silverback gorilla? I?
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:13.400]   Mean is there which animal do you think you can actually defeat that would be impressive that most people would say you can't
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.960]   You know I actually I don't have an answer to this
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.520]   I thought you were gonna say I want I want I want to say that me and John had like a four-hour
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.740]   Discussion on this one time. I'm like what would win bear or gorilla?
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:31.440]   And he went into like this whole dissertation about how like Jaguar spin underneath and like barren bolo
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:35.760]   Silverbacks and kill them and like rip their rip their artery in their legs out. It was amazing
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.040]   I guess okay, so before we talk about strength John. Let me ask you what?
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.520]   Do you think people would be surprised by if two animals faced?
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:50.840]   One of them would win and people wouldn't predict that so they would be surprised by the effectiveness of certain animal at fighting
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.760]   In the whether it's in the forest in the jungle, so let's move it slow down
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.980]   Yeah, okay, so there's two animals of different species fighting and it and most people would pick
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:08.640]   So for example the lion gets a lot of credit for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why the king of the jungle
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:12.520]   Well, I you know a lot of people told me that the lion
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:18.180]   For example the tiger can be lion. Yeah, this is one of those age-old debates
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.860]   Yeah, well in grappling in fighting
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:28.200]   It feels like some animals use teeth and some use other parts of their body
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.000]   also like bear actually, I don't even know how they I
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:39.720]   Think they have extraordinarily powerful and long claws and in addition they're powerful bytes as well
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:45.520]   So I wonder and the same with the silverback. I don't know how much there. I love that we're having this discussion
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.180]   We need Joe Rogan for this. I think so. Yeah, I think so
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.560]   so
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:56.080]   Your your question has gone in and in about five different. So it started with strength
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.880]   and let's go back there, which is
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:04.100]   Do you think for an athlete in jiu-jitsu? Let's stick to grappling?
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.960]   Do you think strike strength is helpful or detrimental?
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.560]   I've always believed that two things will
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.560]   create whatever
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.320]   Whatever effectiveness you have in grappling those are your skill set and your attributes
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.840]   And the best athletes are those who excel in both
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:29.560]   Don't kid yourself if someone gets twice as strong
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.640]   By some kind of magic potion
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.960]   They're going to be a more effective grappler if someone gets twice the level of endurance that they had
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:45.560]   Previously they will be a more effective grappler. These physical attributes have a very important outcome on the
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.260]   Sorry a very important effect upon the outcome of matches
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.200]   It's always a good thing to be stronger. It's always a good thing to have better endurance
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.600]   It's always a good thing to have better balance or whatever other attribute you throw out there
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:06.280]   Gordon's point was okay. Everyone agrees on that but there's a problem in order to build these things
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:13.920]   You have to carve into other elements of your training regimen and then it becomes which becomes more important
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.920]   increases in strength or increases in skill
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.760]   There comes a point where
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:28.280]   Investing in strength training starts to get diminishing returns. I can't tell the difference between someone who bench presses
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:34.040]   300 pounds on the mat versus someone who bench presses 400 pounds, but that's a big difference
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:39.560]   That's a hundred pound difference and for an athlete to go from bench pressing 300 pounds to 400 pounds
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:44.000]   That would require a great deal of of training effort and focus
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.960]   But if I can't tell the difference when I grapple and then why bother okay
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.880]   Once you get to a certain strength level
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.280]   It doesn't really help that much to go from a 400 pound bench press to a 450 pound bench press
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:01.160]   If that's the stage you you're really getting a diminishing and returns on your training investment
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   Now skills on the other hand
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:12.300]   Experience far far less in terms of diminishing returns every new skill you develop
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:20.160]   Can translate very very well into big increases in performance. Look at the example of Gary Tonin that we talked about earlier
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.840]   investments in guillotine
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.360]   made a significant improvement in his
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.700]   Effectiveness in matches and led directly to some of his most important victories
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:34.600]   But if he had invested the same amount of training time in
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:41.760]   Developing a bench press that was 25 pounds more than previously that would have had no outcome no influence on the outcome of those matches
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.520]   So the question always becomes yep, everyone acknowledges that these physical
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:52.920]   Attributes are important and everyone understands that becoming stronger or fitter is a
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:04:01.200]   Desirable thing and every athlete should work on them. The interesting question becomes okay at what point do you start to say?
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.840]   I'm not going to be helped by further increases in
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.040]   in strength training or endurance training
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.160]   and
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.120]   my point with my athletes is in the
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.640]   overwhelming majority of cases
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.680]   If there's any kind of doubt
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:24.440]   Invest more heavily in skill training than attribute training, especially once you get to a certain level on the attributes
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.240]   well, the interesting thing that I think you should account for with strength training is
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.400]   There's Instagram
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.880]   There's the world it's a it seems to be more fun to build muscle mass
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.640]   It's like an addiction people have there's also economic elements to like most people I hate to say this, but it's true
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.560]   most people are more concerned with image than function and
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:55.480]   It's hard to sell a
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:03.680]   Fighter or a jujitsu athlete who doesn't look like one looks like Vader. Yeah, it's a tough sell now
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.680]   You can do it in fighting and in jujitsu because ultimately it's about whose
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.440]   Hand is raised at the end of the match and you could even use it as a selling point
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.440]   You can be a guy that doesn't look like he should be winning but he is winning that is a selling point
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.160]   but if you give most people a choice between
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:25.200]   Looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger and winning matches versus looking like Vader and winning matches most people will select
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.880]   I wish I'd rather look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And so most athletes feel almost like an economic
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.080]   Impulsion to be in good shape and in order to advance their marketability
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:42.080]   Yeah, Nike's not gonna sponsor fate or tank habit. Yeah tank habit. No
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.360]   fatal, maybe
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.400]   But yeah, yeah, we need at the very top. There's there's something about a static
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:54.160]   Like image of strength and power. It's also an also a personal thing
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.400]   If you look at yourself in the mirror, do you like what what you see? You know what I mean?
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.600]   Yeah, do you find yourself attractive? You know, what what can you do to make you look better?
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.360]   And I think to me to me it was something and one of the reason I work out it's also for you for that
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.120]   Well, I'm sure if fatal looks in the mirror. He says I look damn good today
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:17.640]   Some people you know, it's harder for them. I mean, yeah
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:23.520]   Alright, so the question on training you guys John Gordon train
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   Often three times a day every day
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   I'm
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.480]   George had a different like a
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   Different approach to training. So like what is for not? I don't mean that kind of the opposite or something
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.640]   It's just not every single day. So and
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.400]   obviously you are
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:51.640]   Legitimately at the very top in terms of performance accomplishment in the field. So what have you learned about?
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.600]   What it takes to train to become not just a lead but the best well I I a
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.960]   Lot of people when you say train they see training hard. I believe you need to be very constant
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:15.760]   And very disciplined you need to train but you don't need to train hard every day. That's what John taught me
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.360]   For me is the nervous system. Sometimes I feel if I load it up too much it comes to a point that you're
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:28.000]   It's too much. There is no no more information that I can absorb
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.760]   so
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.240]   And I do believe that it's something that you can train to your the
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.200]   capacity your capacity of being able to learn of absorbing certain thing and
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.160]   I did a lot of volume of training
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:48.120]   But when I when I was getting ready for a fight, especially during sparring day
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:55.400]   I like to do it quick because my when I fight it's five round of five minutes. I don't like to spend
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:05.040]   An hour or two hours in a gym because I need to know how hard I can be
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.520]   Going for 25 minutes, you know when I not for two hours for 25 minutes and at my last fight
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   John and I we
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.520]   we
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.880]   We were thinking of how could we?
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.840]   Make me more
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.480]   of a better finisher, you know more opportunist and
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:30.520]   John, I remember we when we were training with Gordon Jake Schill came Gary Tonin
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:35.320]   my round of grappling were different than if I would be training for
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:41.840]   Abu Debbie, you know for for a bi or like some like in grappling the round are longer
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.160]   but in a mixed martial art fight
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.360]   It's very rare that you're gonna spend more than
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:54.320]   Four minutes or four minutes and a half on the ground. It's very unlikely
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.960]   I mean it could I can happen but so I
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:03.000]   Do you remember we did the round three minute we did all the round I was doing were three minute round
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.040]   So it gives a different
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.800]   Rhythm to the training it forced me to be more opportunist to be more of a finisher
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.000]   Because I had only three minute to do what I needed to do
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.760]   So if I if I say something I need to go for the kill right away
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.480]   I cannot be too over patient, you know what I mean?
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.280]   And it it served me well in my last fight and I think it that's a good blueprint to follow
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.440]   when you're a mixed martial art fighter if I would if
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.680]   the result where it was great and I think
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.680]   it
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.000]   Maybe I should have done that before it was a great great idea that we had not to do
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.680]   Be very careful doing too much volume
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.520]   Yes, try to get out and then try to focus on finishing getting getting up
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.960]   It's I mean it's obvious to build up your foundation
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:58.120]   I believe you need a lot of volume but when you get ready for a competition you need some to be something that
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.680]   Replicate what you're gonna be facing. What are you what are we talking about? What do you think?
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.240]   Like is there rest days five days a week?
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.720]   Twice a day once a day. Is there any one formula like that or no?
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.240]   This this I do not believe in over training. I believe in under rest. I
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.560]   believe
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.000]   You can be under rest and
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.280]   people
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:30.920]   Always link that immediately to the volume of their how much volume they they train which it could be something else
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.680]   How are you feeling? I'm emotionally. Are you you having?
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.720]   problems
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:43.600]   Personal problem. Do you have a hard time sleeping because you have a like someone died or I don't know like you
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.520]   You hold money you're broke or what like, you know, I mean could be anything
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.160]   There is something that can affect you psychologically or emotionally
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:59.360]   That made it in a way that you cannot sleep. Well because your your stress your cortisol level is high
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.760]   You're you know what? I mean all these factor need to be take taken in consideration
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.240]   It's not only about the volume of training people
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.160]   Always think the volume of the training is the only thing that can affect
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.200]   Recuperation which is not you know, yeah, I said to minimize the amount of stress from all kinds of fact
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.640]   It's a very stressful job to be a professional
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:31.120]   Combat athlete whether you're a grappler a boxer kickboxer a fighter and you need to be taking as
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.000]   Into account is it more or less stressful than marriage? Just kidding
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.160]   next question
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:47.080]   So, I don't know how to ask this question given what George just said but you training three times a day and
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:55.680]   Finishing and what what have you learned about what brings out the best in you as as the elite level grappler
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.400]   So over the recent years have actually changed it up a little bit
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.840]   when I was
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:08.240]   Coming up through from white to black belt. I felt that the volume was the most important
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.080]   So it would be anywhere from like three
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.680]   to seven sessions a day
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:21.600]   Going from school to school from New York to New Jersey, and I think that the volume was very important to build the skills
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.920]   Where I just didn't know how to move my body at purple belt the way that I should
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.080]   So I think that building the skills is
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:36.800]   It's super important. I think that early on volumes very important now that I already have the skills built
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.920]   I think that acquiring more knowledge is the most important
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.960]   So I find that if I do so many sessions a day like if I do three sessions a day
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.680]   I feel sometimes by the third session
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.880]   I'm just like so mentally like there's just there's so much information
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.520]   That's went through my head the first two sessions that I feel like I'm not even there mentally on the third session
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.960]   So I feel like doing less volume now
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.000]   But having more mental clarity per session is more important because I already have the foundational skills acquired
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.160]   So a lot of your training is almost like
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:15.200]   Just thinking like learning a lot of it. Yeah, so I'll do like
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:21.620]   I mean our schedules been messed up since the pandemic because Henzo's got shut down and they were using a French gym in Puerto Rico
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:24.780]   And now we're using a French gym in our and in Austin
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:29.400]   But once we have our own school have a setup schedule where I can pretty much just be there all day long
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.900]   But right now I do like a lifting session in the morning, and then I'll come in and help teach at Henzo's
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:40.120]   So I'm there mentally I'm seeing what's going on and I'm playing around with ideas in my head
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.920]   And then I'm there physically and very sharp mentally for the competition class during the 1 p.m.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.080]   Session and then after that I'll go home. I'll rest and get ready for the next day
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:55.800]   What have you learned on seeing all these different athletes there a
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.920]   universal rule that applies or is it
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.360]   athlete specific
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:08.040]   First one thing needs to be addressed is that George and Gordon play very different sports with very different athletic demands
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:15.900]   Gordon can be in matches that range from anywhere from six minutes to literally hours long
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.700]   as a result
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.700]   the overall
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:28.020]   Pacing and intensity of matches is massively different most obviously there is no striking and Gordon sport
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.280]   Striking by its very nature is a much more explosive
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.300]   Physical action than grappling is grappling is primarily an isometric
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:40.320]   Kind of sport based around an isometric tension and endurance
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.640]   Georgia sport is
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:49.960]   Does feature a significant amount of isometric tension, but the majority of it is based around explosion
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:57.020]   So the physical demands of the two sports are radically different in addition the time of application is
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.840]   Radically different George raised a very interesting point his matches seem long 25 minutes for a championship match
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.120]   But always understand it
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.860]   It makes martial arts fight at championship level if it goes the distance is really
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:18.000]   five five minute matches each round is
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.560]   A match in itself and that's exactly how you're scored
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:28.840]   You're scored by who wins the most matches over five matches as a result the application of the techniques
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.320]   especially the grappling techniques has to be done at a certain pace as
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.760]   George pointed out realistically
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.680]   the maximum application time you're going to get in most situations is somewhere between
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:46.720]   15 seconds and three minutes even for a specialized grappler like Damian Meyer
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:53.800]   There's still a significant part of each round which is spent in setup time to actually get the match to the ground
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:16:00.920]   It's very likely that at some point your opponent will stand up out of grappling and you'll have to reinitiate the entire process again
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:07.420]   So that even for specialized grapplers you might be spending only three minutes out of a five minute round
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:14.800]   On the ground and as a result you've got to get your work done in a very short time frame
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.560]   Gordon Ryan once it goes to the ground and it can go to the ground because he chooses to sit to the ground
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.120]   May spend the entire match in ground positions
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:35.180]   As a result the matches have completely different pacing and completely different physical demands and the preparation that the two athletes go through will reflect that
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:42.120]   If George st. Pierre in training for mixed martial arts becomes fatigued to a point
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:50.040]   Where he's no longer physically effective and able to defend himself the consequences for that in MMA training can be very deep indeed
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:57.360]   Okay, if you make a mistake in mixed martial arts because you're fatigued and tired and you take a full power roundhouse kick to the head
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:05.440]   That's some deep consequences a grappler doesn't have to face that you can be completely exhausted in grappling and just sit in the bottom of
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:11.520]   The mountain just practice just survival skills. We just don't get submitted from bottom out and that can still be an effective training session
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.680]   complete and utter physical breakdown of fatigue can be
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.360]   Can end an athlete's career and mixed martial arts the consequences of?
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.320]   training through fatigue and MMA
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.640]   Potentially very deep and very disturbing
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   The consequences of training through complete physical exhaustion and grappling aren't really that severe. Okay, you just tap whenever there's a problem just tap
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.280]   And so they're very very different sports in the way you you prepare for them
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.040]   in a grappling
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.960]   athlete like Gordon Ryan we can take
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:51.200]   many more liberties with physical exhaustion and
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.980]   The amount of hours a day you spend in training then you could with a mixed martial arts athlete like actually be a benefit
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.800]   exhaustion as a
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.400]   Framework of learning so like from a place of exhaustion
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:11.280]   Is there any benefit to the you only you said being at the bottom of mouth sort of understanding?
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.960]   Did you get to grappling somehow deeper because you're physically absolutely absolutely
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:22.400]   Because then the only thing you have left in your favor is your technique and then you'll see how technical you are in
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:28.600]   addition you'll get to explore realms inside your mind that we don't spend a lot of time in and
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:33.600]   you'll learn a lot about yourself and your ability to do a which will have
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:41.160]   Potentially great benefits in similar situations and matches. Yeah, there's a I mean for me for a recreational person
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.760]   getting
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:50.640]   Exhaustion allows you the great benefit to experience what it feels like to really get dominated at an even greater frequency
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.000]   than you otherwise would and
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:19:00.760]   There's something there there's some animalistic thing that's very unpleasant and then afterwards it takes you to a nice to a place of
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.840]   like
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.480]   humility and I
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:09.000]   Know you get it forces you to rethink life in positive ways
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.520]   There's something about dominance. It can be if you get dominated a few times you can
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.920]   Rationalize it somehow you say okay
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:24.160]   well I've screwed this up but with it when you're exhausted and you have to do like 30 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour of
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.000]   Just being down me over and over and over being submitted
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.960]   It I don't know. It's it's a very good process for
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:37.440]   For other avenues of life. I find I can't explain why some I'm
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:44.000]   Driving home crying afterwards listening to Bruce Springsteen, but afterwards
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.960]   Yeah, this
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:53.800]   Afterwards somehow you can think clearer you can see clear about what is the right path through life in all walks of life like
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.080]   relationships work, but also the grappling
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.360]   Actually, the grappling is the hardest one to see what you have to do
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:05.880]   It clarifies other avenues the humility. It's the it removes the bullshit
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:13.600]   It's like we see the world through some kind of fog and it just removes it and now you can see things clearly
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.680]   I don't know what that is. I think I think it's important
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.280]   Like you mentioned to push yourself like sometime
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:27.120]   To see how far you can go because sometimes you can go further than than what you think and it can boost your confidence
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:27.480]   You know
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:34.800]   You can push yourself through a certain limit and maybe you thought your limit were was before that point and you push through it
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:40.180]   But like John just mentioned it's a risky thing to do in
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:47.240]   Striking because if you're exhausted, you're gonna get brain damage and grappling it's you know
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:51.800]   You tap if something wrong, but you can do it also in strength conditioning. I like to run track
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.360]   I do it all the time and track and feel it. It helps me to
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.560]   To to know myself better. I think it's important. So it's a good point
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.600]   It's like it's like the scrimmage wrestling rounds we do it's like, you know, if you stop moving
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:12.440]   That you're gonna get scored on and you know in your mind like there's no mechanical reason why I am
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:17.280]   Why I should give up a score here, but you're so exhausted that you're like, oh man, this is terrible
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.480]   If I if I stop moving, I'm a pussy
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.900]   If I don't stop move if I don't stop moving I'm gonna be twice as exhausted when we actually do stand up
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:30.440]   So it's a it's an interesting game. You have to play inside your mind. It's it's your pride very often that that
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.240]   Keep you that keep you
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:40.000]   Sharp, you know what? I mean? Because you just want to lay down and beat it because you're completely exhausted, you know
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.160]   What do you think is the connection John between this ego pride thing?
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.960]   martial arts and actual violence in our
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:54.480]   With our ancestors. Do you think you ever plug into that?
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:59.400]   You think there's echoes of something going on there or like you mentioned you have flaws and demons
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.160]   Is it deep in there somewhere?
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.160]   Do you think we're struggling with those demons?
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:10.120]   Yeah, you'll need to patch up your question or what though. It's going in several different directions. Wow
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.280]   That was not only my big dominant. It's just I mean Dominic
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:20.600]   We're like, okay now we interview you
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:31.400]   I mean, do you think do you I don't mean just a line between what is what is martial arts and what is violence?
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:38.680]   I mean there there seems to be a gray area and that connects us to the the evolutionary ancestors. Absolutely
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.040]   Yeah, yeah. I mean, I I think there's a deep
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:44.320]   recognition and all of us that
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.640]   and this is
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.800]   The evidence for this is is so easy to to see in in daily life
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:59.440]   If you're walking down the street and suddenly you hear a commotion and two people are fighting
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:08.080]   You will see literally everyone on that street stop whatever they're doing and watch the fight
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.640]   Humans are
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.040]   fascinated by
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.560]   violence and
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:22.680]   You've got to ask yourself why and of course, it's a recognition that for a significant part of our evolutionary history
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.440]   violence was one of the most important elements in
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:33.280]   Human existence as much as we curse it as much as we talk badly of it
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:43.000]   The juxtaposition between humans social nature and their need to for each other to get along and to express
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.880]   Love amongst the the various members of a given community
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.520]   there are
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.840]   Disputes between humans that can't be resolved and ultimately
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.720]   Throughout history violence has been the number one method of
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.920]   conflict resolution
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.840]   for better or for worse and there's a recognition and all of us that
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.120]   This is where we come from and there's a reason why
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:16.360]   Combat sports have this thing where people will watch them and they might even be repulsed by them
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.080]   but they find it difficult to take their eyes from it and
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.080]   I
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.160]   Do believe that most combat athletes carry that sense of their
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:32.880]   even if it's on a subconscious level this kind of belief that
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.880]   This is who we are
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.400]   George you use the word pride and I believe that's a big part of it. I believe that
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.760]   Most
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:49.160]   humans have this sense of self-worth and pride which they're willing to fight for and
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.320]   If it gets crossed by someone else, they're willing to stand that
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:59.200]   Some people will stand more early and some people could be pushed further back, but everyone's got that line
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.600]   beyond which they won't be pushed and
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.600]   There's some kind of deep recognition and all of us that we have that somewhere within us
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:12.800]   No matter how hard we try to bury it or what have you and that's why I believe there will always be this eternal
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.240]   interest in combat sports
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:24.400]   Now I don't believe that most people today have any kind of respect for unrestricted violence or
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.480]   non-consensual violence
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:34.160]   I think most people most good people are repulsed by that now. I'm I'm sure that as humanity
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.040]   Improves out into the future that will become more and more widespread
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.960]   but
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:43.520]   That's not to say we can't exercise these these
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.120]   Old evolutionary demons inside of us and
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.400]   And
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:57.320]   sometimes there are just disputes between different people different cultures different nations where ultimately it's going to come to
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:01.960]   Into into a shoving match and that will degenerate further into violence
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.680]   there's always going to be a need for humans to be able to
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.720]   to
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.600]   express themselves
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.720]   Through violent methods and to use physical force to get to their their goals and objectives
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.240]   Our
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.760]   our need as humans is always to find a balance between
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.080]   the two forces of conflict and
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:32.120]   Cooperation we need cooperation because humans isolated from each other more or less helpless and useless
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.600]   in order to
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:40.440]   Advance human communities need to build and grow and so that sense of cooperation
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.320]   occurs in most of our daily lives
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.760]   but there will also be
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.640]   Irresolvable conflicts where physical force has to be used to form a resolution and so most human beings find themselves
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.800]   swinging like a pendulum between conflict and cooperation and
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.280]   And that is something which
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:09.920]   Really gives birth I think to combat sports because sorry. I really have to ask you about this then there's a guy in Harvard
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:15.960]   Named Richard Rangham, and there's a lot of people that believe this he wrote this book that
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:22.040]   Basically, there's a lot of people studying is what happened. How do we get from apes to humans?
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.240]   Like what was the magic thing right a lot of people attributed to fire and ability to cook meat
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.440]   There's a lot of different theories. So he actually
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.520]   his
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.920]   Theory how do I describe this is basically that that the beta males one?
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.440]   that the the the
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:51.720]   Apes that were able to cooperate. So you the way you develop cooperation is there's a big bad leader
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.880]   that
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.680]   the alpha male
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.680]   that you can only
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:05.920]   Knock off their throne if you cooperate and so we built big tribes that just excelled the cooperation by
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:12.920]   Practicing the overthrowing the leader and so and anytime an alpha male would rise up they would get would
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:19.520]   Would develop our skill further and further of cooperation. And so we're all just beta males
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:28.000]   The descendants of beta mouse that says kind of theory that cooperation is fundamental and it's so distinct to the the rest of the
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.640]   neighboring animal kingdom
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.640]   So fascinating. I wonder what you think about this tension of violence of cooperation
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:43.320]   How important is this cooperation to the core of you know, who is you you can look at it in the in a given training room?
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:50.900]   Jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts is solo sports a solo athlete steps into the cage or steps onto the mat
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:56.920]   but all of your preparation is done in a cooperative training environment with many peers and
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:04.680]   As much as it's an individual sport all of your preparation is done in it as part of a group
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:09.720]   There's a sense in which
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.080]   That's an interesting metaphor for humanity itself everything we do in life
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.720]   We do alone, but we grow up in this given community and what have you
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:26.600]   With regards the the whole alpha male beta male thing
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:32.760]   Humans are it's true. This fella's correct. We you know, most
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:40.920]   primates do have very strongly defined alpha males who rule the roost and determine the entire direction of the
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:47.400]   The community they build around themselves
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:51.360]   Humans on the other hand
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.560]   Don't have an alpha male in that strict
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.200]   Biological sense of someone who's responsible for the next generation
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.280]   Dominates all the female population, etc
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.600]   Yeah physically dominates but we do on the other hand have our own
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:12.200]   version of alpha males and so far as we have political and sociological leaders who have a
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.520]   Disproportionate impact on the direction of a community
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:21.600]   So was the cooperation allowed us to
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:29.720]   Have a greater scale of hierarchy with the alpha male on top or the alpha creature on top. Yeah. Yeah
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.000]   No, that's a fascinating theory
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.520]   In in nature were were very weak as a species
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:43.040]   so we needed to cooperate in order to to evolve that I think
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.640]   Made us that the top of the food chain if you look at
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.880]   Humanity in nature
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.360]   really the two things that seem to
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:31:00.920]   More than anything else determine whether or not a given human community will be
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:05.680]   Successful in a predatory world on numbers and technology
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:06.760]   Okay
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:10.880]   the more your numbers increase and the the higher the technology of the weapons and
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.920]   Support systems you have around you the more successful you'll be in a predatory world
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.640]   So it's not clear that just
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.520]   Killing off the idea of an alpha male was the the single biggest thing
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.720]   the rise of technology
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.920]   and the growth of community
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:35.680]   After the imposition of language, these are other things that would have been very very important factors and in humanities rise
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.720]   George you made an interesting point if you look at humans
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.680]   Just the raw material of humans with with with fucking pathetic
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:48.320]   And a predatory animal kingdom, we're just the absolute bottom of the food chain
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.320]   We don't have a single
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.760]   effective
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.040]   Weapon other than better than average endurance. That's about it
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:02.640]   But you put us in a community who can talk to each other with language give us the time
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:07.400]   to come up with technological advances such as metals
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.560]   And suddenly a human will go from no combat effectiveness in the animal kingdom
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.480]   To a human armed with a simple metal tip spear can kill
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:25.600]   Damn near any animal in the in the animal kingdom and working as a group. I'll beat your silver back
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:32.160]   You know, I'll I'll fight him in a deep water pool because he cannot swim so I don't have to touch him
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.240]   He'll drown and I'll get him into the pool
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:42.120]   You know why because someone told me because we live in a community someone told me that information so I know he passed it on to me
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.360]   Yeah, he taught you
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:49.600]   Well, you have to convince him to you have to somehow convince him to join you in the pool, which is very difficult
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.040]   It's a very problem. Very very difficult
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:59.200]   From a technical perspective John you've looked at
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:04.600]   Mixed martial arts fighting in general and grappling. What's the difference between fighting and grappling?
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:10.560]   That's something I'd love to ask all of you. Maybe John you can start like well
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:13.960]   When you talk about fighting you mean unrestricted
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:22.880]   MMA top-time fighting. Yeah, it's funny. You said unrestricted MMA type MMA type fighting. So there's this this
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:29.640]   Yep. Yeah, there's MMA fighting and then there's grappling. It's really the sport of grappling you're saying
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:32.040]   Okay, what's the difference between MMA and grappling? Yes. Okay
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.840]   See that would have been a much better question. Yes
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.440]   well the
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.840]   the single
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.440]   When you talk about grappling you're talking about jiu-jitsu rules on yeah
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:48.680]   I mean you could maybe also mention different rule sets that somehow fundamentally challenge change the sport, you know
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.320]   in the sport of mixed martial arts
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.880]   You've got two
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:01.200]   Ways to inflict damage on the human body you've got kinetic energy which is done through striking
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.000]   kicking knees elbows fists
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.520]   and you've got
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:10.280]   Isometric tension used along the lines of
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.680]   lever and fulcrum
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.840]   Which can be used for strangulation and joint breaking
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:22.440]   In grappling you lose one of those you you're no longer allowed to hurt your opponent with kinetic energy
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:25.320]   you can do it accidentally through a throw, but you're not allowed to just
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.960]   You know knock someone out with a throw in most grappling sports it can happen
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.040]   But it's relatively rare and it's it's not encouraged by the rule set. So
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:39.320]   Yeah, you got close
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.960]   So
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.520]   there's a sense in which in mixed martial arts you got twice as many problems to deal with and
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.320]   and they occur in a
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:57.680]   much shorter time frame the single biggest difference between grappling technique as a weapon in
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.120]   Human combat versus striking technique is time
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.040]   Grappling technique takes a huge amount of time to apply
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.660]   Okay, the great advantage of grappling technique is certainty of outcome once you get there
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:15.160]   It takes a huge amount of time to set up a takedown
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.040]   physically take them down
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:24.760]   Work their way work your way towards a dominant position culminating in your opponent's back and then apply a stranglehold
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.240]   that's a long chain of events as
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.840]   opposed to a
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:37.080]   Strong punch or kick which can take quarter of a second than application from start to finish and the matches over
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.240]   and
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.240]   so there's a sense in which
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.040]   Grappling is it's
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.600]   It's fighting for the patient and the calculating
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:58.920]   Whereas striking is much more for us in this short time frame where everything gets done and in the blink of an eye
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:05.360]   There's a sense also which grappling is a much more forgiving sport. You can make a terrible mistake
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.520]   End up in a terrible position and still fight your way out and win
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.720]   in
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.800]   Mixed martial arts. It's much much less forgiving
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.800]   If you get hit and stunned your chances of recovery
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:27.080]   Minimal you're going to get swarmed on and unless it's right at the end of the round you it's very very hard to recover from
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.080]   Getting hit and swarmed on
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.680]   So there's a sense in which
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:35.920]   The biggest difference between them is time of application of technique
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:40.920]   In mixed martial arts, it's incredibly unforgiving in terms of time
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:48.280]   Even the smallest error can have the deepest consequences in grappling. You can make massive errors and still come back and win
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.880]   Grappling will typically be won
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:59.080]   in a much higher percentage case by the more skilled and conditioned grappler, whereas there is
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:05.240]   much more of what they call a punches chance in mixed martial arts where
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.200]   There's a much higher likelihood of a lesser athlete
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:15.920]   Defeating a greater athlete in MMA than there isn't grappling simply because of time of application of his techniques
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.980]   Even the smallest period of inattention in MMA and the match is over
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:27.760]   Gordon Ryan could fall asleep for 30 seconds have his opponent mounted on and wake up and finish him in five minutes later
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.840]   It's not gonna happen in MMA
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.160]   Okay, so the the stakes are much higher
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.280]   You can do a lot of damage in a very small amount of time and just the dynamic temporal dynamics of how things happen
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.400]   Is near different everything you'll see will be a reflection of that
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:47.880]   Then you go further into things like rule sets in the sport of grappling if Gordon Ryan comes out and sits down
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:53.800]   in the middle of the mat his opponent must follow him to the ground and engage in
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.480]   Mixed martial arts if you come to the center of the cage and sit down
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.440]   The other guy can just walk away from you. They're completely
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.600]   Oriented in different directions grappling is ground centered MMA is typically standing centered
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:11.280]   It's begin of every round you have to start standing again
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:17.640]   If I disengage from a ground grappling situation stand up and walk away from my opponent
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.040]   My opponent must follow me up to the feet in
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:25.720]   Grappling. It's the exact opposite if I sit to the ground my opponent must follow me to the ground
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:31.640]   It's written into the rule set and so one is inherently ground or oriented and one is inherently standing oriented
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.920]   So it's more it's more difficult to dictate where the fight happens in mixed martial arts
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.960]   Yes, you have to be able to impose where the fighters where is in grappling you can simply choose it
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.920]   So George, what is your sense of the the difference in terms of how you approached it?
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:54.880]   Between the two sports. So you also are a student of wrestling and grappling so in preparing for fights
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:00.640]   What parts of grappling purely the sport that you have to leave behind
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.400]   I
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:08.720]   Am very lucky. I had the opportunity to I train with I consider the best
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:11.560]   mentor trainer I ever ever had and
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.560]   I have
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:19.560]   Some of the best grapplers that I can train with they were they were there to help me to my career
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.040]   so
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.040]   for my training is
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:29.400]   Of course because I do not dedicate as much time in one specific area
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:36.520]   It's hard to be you know a world-class athlete and that in only one particular area always
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.680]   for me
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:45.960]   Like the idea to be more well-rounded to be very competent in every of those areas striking grappling
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:52.760]   takedowns and all those areas then being just very good at one and
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:58.520]   not as good at as others, you know because I like the idea that
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:03.760]   It gives me more option when I fight someone I can
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.760]   mold myself to become the perfect nemesis to
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:14.000]   That person better if I'm more well-rounded if I do not have those well-rounded skill
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.800]   and
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.800]   I don't have that option, you know
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:22.680]   You have less tools to work with less technology. What about you Gordon? What?
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:29.200]   What do you think is very distinct about grappling in the way you approach it versus fighting
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.920]   I think most of it was covered
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:36.000]   But I think that though the one one of the big things is the fact that when you're looking at MMA
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.120]   You have a pretty general agreed-upon and unified rule set where if you look at UFC versus Bellator
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.720]   There they have slight differences in the rules maybe
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.200]   But it's pretty much the same thing
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:53.280]   Whereas in grappling you have EBI rules and you have a DCC rules you have IBGJF rules
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:59.600]   You have no time limit rules and each rule set will play to the skills of different athletes
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.600]   If you have if you do ADCC rules
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:07.720]   it generally is slightly biased towards wrestlers or if they can stall to the overtime and
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.920]   Then hit a takedown in the overtime and not really doing a jiu-jitsu, but they score a takedown
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:16.200]   They're gonna win whereas if you have like an EBI, for example
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:22.700]   You have to finish the guy in regulation or you start in a jiu-jitsu position with your back taken or in an armbar
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.100]   so I think that you have
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:28.380]   certain rule sets that play in the favor of
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.060]   certain athletes and
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:36.380]   Certain athletes can win in one rule set but then they just have no chance of winning in the other
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.780]   Like when I fought Yuri the first time in EBI
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:44.640]   I beat him in EBI the chances of me beating him on that night under an ADCC rule set were probably pretty low
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:49.560]   When I fought Leandro low under an ADCC rule set he beat me that day
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.360]   But the chances of him beating me in the same day in an EBI rules that were like next to zero
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.460]   So I think it's interesting that
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:02.580]   In MMA you have one unified rule set which have small differences, but they're all generally the same
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:06.420]   I'm in and jiu-jitsu you have a wide variety of different rule sets that
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:09.140]   have
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:17.360]   Biases towards a certain athlete skill sets you mentioned Leandro low. I got to ask you again about ADCC
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:21.860]   You have lost very very few times in your career
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:25.960]   one I mean this is the same is true for George and
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:31.880]   The only person who has ever submitted you is Felipe Pena black belt. Yeah a black belt
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:38.560]   He is a DCC world champion multiple-time IBJJF Guianogi world champion
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:42.500]   You may face him a ADCC or elsewhere in the future
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:45.540]   Will you beat him?
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:48.340]   Yes, I mean I have to say yes, right
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.340]   but uh, I
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:55.880]   Fought him initially when I first got my black belt that I fought him a year later. So 2016 and
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:02.140]   2017 and despite what people remember about the match and whenever people talk about it's like oh, yeah
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:06.620]   The guy who strangled Gordon but no one remembers that the first match was like a 45 minute war
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:12.540]   And then the second match with the full 20 minutes of ADCC and if I didn't get my back taken in like the last
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:17.780]   Minute and a half two minutes. It would have went into an overtime. I could change the outcome of the match
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.220]   I
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:28.400]   Think that if you look at Felipe's performances, especially nogi specifically nogi since then it looks like he's almost gotten worse
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.780]   whereas since that match
[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:33.300]   in 2017
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:38.340]   the only match I lost after that was against Vinny my glish by my points and
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:44.300]   I'm on like a 55 match win streak over the course of four years
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:47.060]   winning all the major tournaments nogi and
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:51.340]   Felipe since that match I think is like five and two
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:59.340]   Nogi and he's lost his last two match matches one was convincingly where he was dominated by Andre and one was by submission
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:03.860]   So I don't think that he's progressed nearly as fast if anything
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:08.460]   He looks he's worse than he was when he beat me in 2017 based on his previous performances
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:14.940]   That being said I know he's gonna come in training very hard for this one and he's gonna be prepared, but I just don't think
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:20.620]   that in terms of technical ability, he's anywhere near my level and
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:27.260]   He was much bigger than me both times. We fought the first time. He was much bigger than me the second time
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:30.900]   He was one way class above me. So now there's not going to be an advantage in
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:36.500]   Technicality and it's also not going to be a physicality advantage. So I think he's just gonna be beat everywhere
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:43.260]   This is a good example of the scientific response to a
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:47.980]   To a comment to a question. Yeah, so he's not
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:54.260]   But that's a match you're you're not deeply concerned with
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:45:00.340]   And in terms of the set of opponents because you you have and you will be facing a lot of really difficult
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:05.780]   Yeah, that's actually in my opinion one of the easier matches because of the fact that we're relatively the same size
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:10.180]   if I show up at 230 pounds like a lot of the guys are
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:16.140]   260 270 plus so that extra weight doesn't make a difference. I think out of that entire bracket
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:21.660]   Felipe is probably gonna be the one of the easiest matches because of the fact that I can easily take him down and
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:23.940]   If I take him down, I'm gonna pass his guard
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:28.460]   Whereas I feel like the other guys because there's so much bigger and they're very cagey
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:32.100]   It may take me a while to actually take them to the ground
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.460]   And get on top of them
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:39.540]   And I think it may be they may be longer drawn-out matches because of the fact that they're so much bigger and stally
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:44.420]   It's hard to take them down. But Felipe is relatively my size and as wrestling is atrocious
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.260]   So I've already taken him down in the last ADCC match
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:51.060]   So I'm pretty sure I can just easily put him down pass him and then finish him
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:57.220]   Well, I'm not sure what response I was expecting but that was those those phrase beautifully
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:06.580]   We talked about the Tiago Alves fight that George had and John barred up in class yesterday I
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:12.580]   Believe but the point is we're talking about wrestling and I think that that's a fascinating fight that
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:16.940]   There's an incredible display of strategy of skill of heart
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:23.300]   George could you maybe talk about that fight John? Maybe - what lessons you gained from that fight?
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:26.340]   Go ahead. It was your fight not mine
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:33.580]   Well, maybe it also tell what happened in terms of your injury I think they're around oh, yeah
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:38.340]   So I was fighting Tiago Alves and in the third round. I
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:42.100]   Tear my adductor muscle
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:47.780]   It happened when I was on the bottom and he I think he pushed my knee down tried to pass my guard and I heard
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.260]   a pop I
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:51.260]   Don't know what I think you're going for an arm bar
[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:57.300]   You were on his back you switched to arm bar and he cleared the leg by pushing on your leg and you went in with
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:03.900]   A pre-existing injury and it tore. Yes, and and it get worse and and I heard a pop
[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:08.500]   I didn't know what it was, but I know it really hurt. So I came back standing up and
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.540]   there's a
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:16.820]   Famous video one that goes on the internet about when I go back in the corner and I tell my my coach
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:21.080]   I'm like, I don't know what it is. I think I tore my my my adductor muscle and
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.920]   Great Jackson is like I don't care hit him with your growing
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:27.200]   I
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.360]   Was very worried because I wasn't paying but I didn't know I did not know what what I had
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:37.480]   So I didn't know the gravity of it and it plays on your mind
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:41.920]   So but I had to buy it to bite down my mouthpiece and finish the fight, you know
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:47.200]   I knew I was ahead on the on the scorecard and now I needed to finish finish strong
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.560]   So what was your strategy there in terms of strikes in terms of wrestling? So he's
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:56.080]   Exceptionally difficult opponent to take down. Yeah. Well at first I
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.760]   Knew I would add a good jab a good, you know to stay always
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:07.040]   From the outside, you know fight him from the outside and and use my footwork because he was like a tank
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.960]   it was much bigger and much stronger than me and
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.840]   I
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:14.120]   Didn't want never wanted to stay in front of him
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:19.000]   So he was all the way out or all the way in and when I was coming all the way in it was with
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.480]   my proactive or reactive takedown where I
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.200]   myself initiated the takedown by
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:33.120]   using a distraction like a jab to make it is and goes up and then I go with a
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.640]   single or double leg or
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.940]   to react like baiting him for him to come hit me and then
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.320]   While he's coming to hit me. I go change level and
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:46.360]   That's the way I like to take my opponent down
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:50.920]   You know some guys for example, like like cabbie, for example, he's very good at
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:59.920]   Bringing his opponent to defense and use chain wrestling to take his opponent down. I find it for me for myself. I specialize more into
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:05.840]   Explosive takedown in the center of the octagon because I found it more economical for me
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:11.220]   What what did you see you were you're commenting John about the wrestling
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:19.600]   Those those quite interesting. I mean also, can you generally comment on the fact that George St. Pierre who don't I don't think you wrestled I
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:25.400]   Russell I started wrestling I was 19 years old, but I wrestled some very good Russian guys
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:28.080]   so they took me underneath their wing and but
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.200]   my ability to cover distance
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:38.440]   Come from karate does not come from wrestling wrestling is how I finish once I got the leg how I finish the takedown
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.400]   So the the timing and the movement and the explosion are wired for this crowd. Yeah, I
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:49.520]   Think an important distinction to make here is one which George
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:55.640]   Made throughout his career and I believe George you were the greatest innovator in MMA history
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:59.200]   with regards this and this is
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.680]   the creation of what George calls shoot boxing, which is the amalgamation of
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:10.840]   Striking technique in George's case mostly karate because that was his martial arts background
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:15.120]   into grappling and in particular takedowns
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:23.520]   When most people say so-and-so has better wrestling in mixed martial arts
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:27.480]   You have to be very careful what they mean by this
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:34.000]   there are many highly credentialed wrestlers in the early days of mixed martial arts who went in and
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.400]   Truly struggled to head a takedown
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:42.760]   Now these are very very good wrestlers who in a wrestling match would easily put down their opponent
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:49.400]   but in a striking situation where the ranges are completely different and the setups are
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:56.640]   Entirely different the stances are different even the the overall conditions are different. You're no longer wearing shoes
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.480]   people
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:04.440]   underestimate just what an impact it is for a wrestler to take the shoes off you lose like 20% of your forward drive the
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.440]   minute you take off the shoes
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:14.840]   All of these make massive differences in whether or not you're going to be able to even make contact with an opponent for a takedown
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.320]   as
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:24.080]   George pointed out the true value of wrestling in MMA is finishing the takedown once you've established contact
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.640]   But that's only about 20% of the action of an of a mixed martial arts takedown
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.880]   80% of it is an understanding range rhythm setup
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:35.880]   opportunity etc, etc and
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:39.080]   That's not part of wrestling at all
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:45.960]   You even the overall conditions are completely different in the sport of wrestling you start a very close range in a very bent over stance
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:50.240]   And you're expected to wrestle for an international stars for three minutes at a time
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:54.280]   Now suddenly you're completely upright
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:57.640]   and
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:04.640]   You're not wearing shoes all the conditions the the rhythm and speed of it is different the counters are completely different
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:10.640]   it's just an entirely different animal and so George was an early recognizer of this and
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:15.800]   Started to put the emphasis on direct training for shoot boxing
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:22.400]   In addition to wrestling so he practiced with very good wrestlers in the Montreal Wrestling Club
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:30.640]   Just the sport of wrestling and that's what made him very good at finishing takedowns, but it was in his shoot boxing training
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:38.760]   Which he himself largely developed remember George started at a time when MMA was pretty damn young and
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:46.560]   He we were when when you entered the sport of mixed martial arts George it wasn't even allowed on TV
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.680]   Like it was completely banned. It was in his country. It was
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:51.560]   physically banned
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:56.640]   They had to fight on Indian reservations and the I mean this is way back in the Wild West days of MMA
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.220]   And so as a as a young developing athlete he had to
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:02.880]   More or less do this by himself
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:07.560]   If you ever want to hear some incredible stories talk about teenage George St. Pierre
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:12.260]   Had a coach who used to make him put on boxing gloves now
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:19.140]   he was 16 17 years old and just put him on a hardwood floor against a professional boxer who was in his
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:21.780]   late 20s at the peak of his career and
[01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:26.940]   He said George you're not allowed to punch. You just got to take him down while he tries to knock you out and
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:29.460]   There was it was crazy
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:33.820]   Darwinism, yeah, he was like it's like you're gonna you're gonna
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:36.660]   Adapt or you're gonna die
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:41.420]   Literally and he could have been very bad, but it turns out to be great is methods
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:45.660]   But there's a sensor in which people think oh, you know
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:50.740]   What determines your takedown ability in MMA is your wrestling skill that?
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:57.980]   Your wrestling skill will determine your finishing ability on takedowns, but there's so much more to it than that
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:02.620]   Whenever people say, you know, what what are the broad?
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:07.160]   Elements that determine the outcome of a mixed martial arts fight
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:11.380]   Okay on the broadest possible level. I always give the same three things
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:16.820]   The athlete who can dominate the pace of the match
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:23.380]   The athlete who can dominate the direction of the match and the athlete who can dominate the setups
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:27.940]   Will win the vast majority of fights therein those three things
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:32.420]   The direction the pace and the setups you dominate all three of those
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:36.260]   You're gonna win 90% of the matches you're in
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:42.660]   George could always dominate the direction of the fight because he could stop the other guy taking him down and
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:46.120]   He could impose his own takedowns at any point in a match
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:50.620]   So whether went to ground or whether it stays standing was always up to him
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:55.220]   George had the most sophisticated array of setups and to takedowns
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:58.740]   That I've personally ever witnessed
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:05.100]   The whole distinction between reactive and proactive takedowns came very early in George's career and
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:09.460]   He excelled in both most people tend to favor one or the other
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:12.940]   Most athletes have a very hard time
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:15.580]   imposing
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:18.460]   Their setups on an opponent and as a result they have to use
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:22.300]   The cage as a crutch for their for their setups
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:25.740]   Would they just bully someone towards occasion then put them down on the cage?
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:32.380]   George is one of the very few people who was equally good against the cage or in the open and could do so in both proactive
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:33.860]   and reactive
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:35.860]   situations
[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:37.500]   and
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:43.980]   The scary thing is that as good as all of you saw him look in the octagon
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:51.140]   Anyone who knows George as a coach will tell you he was twice as good as that in the gym
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:54.700]   Where he would often go against people several weight divisions above himself
[01:55:54.700 --> 01:56:00.220]   I could sit here all day. I won't name names, but I always laugh when people say oh, this is the greatest
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:04.140]   pound for pound guy of all time and I've personally seen George
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:06.980]   Take that guy down and crush him in the gym
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:10.780]   And I can't say anything because it's rude to talk about that in public because it's just training
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:15.860]   But I've seen George go with people all the way to light heavyweight some of the greatest names in the history of the sport
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:17.860]   Put them down
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:23.300]   Advanced position on the ground and dominate them in training. It's it's what he did during that time. I
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:31.140]   Georgia I got to say I deeply admire many of the things I saw you do not just in the octagon but in training as
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:32.820]   well as
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:35.140]   the the impact that you had on
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:39.540]   The degree to which
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:44.300]   Takedowns we use this sport was absolutely inspirational
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:49.460]   That's why one of one of the reasons why I always say you're one of the only athlete I ever met who taught me
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:54.460]   more than than I taught you because you opened my eyes to a whole new world of
[01:56:54.460 --> 01:57:01.940]   Shootboxing and how I grew up in a time when you I was laughing before when you talked about sugar a Leonard
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:06.140]   I was a kid watching that match and I grew up in a time where there was
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:10.700]   boxing and there was kickboxing and then I came to America and I learned grappling and
[01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:15.260]   This young man here was the innovator when it came to the integration of the two
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:19.940]   Well, then I have to ask cuz George sits here uncomfortably being complimented
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:23.580]   If George st. Pierre and
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:31.620]   Khabib Nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins who that's it. Very very loaded quiz. How yeah
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:33.760]   Like what are the different trajectories you see?
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:40.900]   Okay, how does each one win in your view if one wins or the other one wins what happened? Interestingly, they're actually
[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:43.700]   very similar in size despite the fact that
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:46.340]   George fought a welterweight and could be
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:53.440]   Fought it lightweight if you actually see them stand next to each other the of similar height could be actually a little more thick set
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:56.620]   Yeah, he's actually heavier than you walking around
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:03.540]   George walked around most of his career between 188 and 191 pounds and
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:09.060]   So could be actually would ironically have a kind of size and strength advantage
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:11.660]   Despite being in the lighter weight division
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:19.540]   That's been the general trend as MMA has grown is that athletes will come further down and wait to make weight divisions
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:23.220]   I
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:29.860]   Believe that George has the best takedowns in history in the open in the cage
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:36.500]   Khabib was his great strength was using the fence to facilitate takedowns
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:39.660]   Joe
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:46.180]   Khabib's other great strength was not only his ability to take people down but to keep people down for extended periods of time
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:48.580]   both of them were
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:57.580]   Powerful strikers on the ground and could do terrible damage to opponents on the floor. So they're both very similar in that regard
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:00.620]   Khabib was mostly a
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:04.180]   Puncher from the back George is mostly an elbow from the front
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:09.180]   But both of them could lay waste to opponents with strikes on the floor
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:17.620]   Both of them were highly competent with submissions on the ground that they weren't submission specialists in the sense of someone like Gordon Ryan, but
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:20.020]   they were
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:21.940]   certainly
[01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:23.940]   No slouches with submission holds
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:30.540]   Yes, it's a fascinating idea so it's almost like who gets the first takedown
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:33.460]   Yeah, I do believe that
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:40.780]   They could probably stand up on each other. I don't think either one of them would be able to hold the other down for a whole round
[01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:45.220]   Both of them are notoriously difficult people to hold down
[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:49.940]   So I don't think that whoever won the first takedown wins the match. I don't think it's like that
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:57.020]   I do believe that George would hold a decisive advantage in striking and distance management
[01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:01.020]   the few times that could be did look shaky is
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:03.220]   when he
[02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:09.000]   Khabib was either advancing forward menacingly, but when he had to fight moving backwards
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.300]   There was a definite asymmetry between his ability to fight going forwards
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:16.900]   Which is very good and his ability to fight going backwards, which was noticeably
[02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:19.300]   weaker
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:26.460]   George would often fight both forwards and backwards and was the Tiago Elvis fight you most of the standing time
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:28.620]   Yeah, it was was going backwards
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:37.020]   That's probably there was the single biggest difference between the two athletes and skill level would be in the standing position
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:39.980]   on the ground
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:47.060]   Khabib slight edge and takedowns on the fence George slight edge and takedowns in the center
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:54.260]   Ability to inflict damage on the floor roughly equal ability to fight off the back roughly equal
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:58.460]   Ability to stand up from bottom roughly equal. It's a very very hard match
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:00.340]   in
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.340]   terms of the biggest
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:06.500]   Difference in skill level is going to be in a standing position. And so it would come down to
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:11.100]   That doesn't necessarily mean that could be would lose in the standing position
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:15.020]   he might just push it to the fence and just use match tactics where he
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:19.100]   Kept a fight on the fence for significant periods of time
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:25.980]   And you can win rounds in that fashion, so it's a match that could go either way both of them are
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:30.980]   Absolutely the best that you'll ever see I've always believed the three greatest mixed martial artists
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:35.380]   I've ever seen in my life for George St. Pierre could be even know when we get off and John Jones
[02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:41.420]   The three of them have some interesting similarities and differences all three
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:45.500]   Beat every single person they ever faced
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:52.660]   I I know John Jones officially has a loss by DQ, but no one believes that was a loss
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:56.740]   George does have two losses, but he
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:03.740]   Defeated both athletes decisively in rematches could be did it by having no losses
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:11.420]   Interestingly all three athletes have at least one match which is controversial in terms of who won and who lost
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:18.840]   John Jones has had several matches which could have gone either way on the judges scorecard Khabib's
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.460]   Match against Clayson T. Bell could have gone either way
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:26.540]   George's match with Hendricks was could have gone either way
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:32.980]   They all had matches that they won which people would dispute the outcome so that was a similarity between the three of them
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:36.340]   all three of them
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:39.620]   Have had the ability
[02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:45.160]   To dominate the direction of fights when they want it to go down it goes down when they don't want it to go down
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.160]   It doesn't
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:50.220]   That's why I put such a heavy emphasis on that idea that
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:57.620]   Mixed martial arts champion must be able to determine the direction of a fight. It's the single most important attribute that they all must have
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:03.540]   As to which of the three is the best it's going to come down to criteria
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:06.580]   You can't pull them apart the
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:13.100]   Which answer you give as to which of those three is the greatest of all time will come down to the criteria that you use
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.700]   Okay, is it being undefeated?
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:22.700]   Is it the amount of time was that the quality of the opponents that they had if you do it by quality of opponents
[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:25.860]   I think you probably have to give it to George if you do it by
[02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:31.100]   Measured dominance through not being defeated and it has to go to compete
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:35.780]   Arguably you could say the same with John Jones since his one
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:38.780]   losses
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:40.660]   By DQ
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:46.820]   But then you could also say the last three or four fights that John's head haven't been the same measure of dominance as we saw
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:51.380]   previously so ultimately you've got those three guys in my opinion and
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:57.740]   Which one you choose will come down to who it says more about who you are as a viewer than it does about?
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:04:03.500]   The respective level of the athletes you could throw a blanket over them. The three of them are just that good and
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:11.700]   And which one you select will probably say more about who you are as a viewer than it does about them as athletes
[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:16.660]   The goat is not even born
[02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:19.660]   because the generation
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:22.540]   That is present
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:24.940]   benefit of a huge advantage
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:29.260]   they have knowledge technology that we didn't have before and
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:33.980]   We had the knowledge that the other generation did not have before
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:36.540]   but I
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:40.700]   Believe the best the goat is not even born yet as good as they are today
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:44.660]   I think you in sport where you can measure the performance
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:46.940]   track and field
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:49.500]   Olympic lifting you can you know someone is
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:54.260]   Better than the other one because you can measure the performance fighting. It's all subjective
[02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:58.100]   we always debate of who would win but
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:01.100]   10 the tendency in sport is
[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:02.860]   That
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:09.620]   Performance get better. I don't think it's because the athlete necessarily get better. It's because they have access to better technology knowledge and
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:12.340]   They learn from their predecessor
[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:15.700]   As long as that knowledge is transferred forward
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:22.980]   Something tells me that the greatest of all time lived a few thousand years ago and it's forgotten some of the greatest warriors
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:28.340]   They can imagine the kind of grapplers. We just the history didn't record them
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:33.100]   Mmm, there could have been small tribes where they developed many UFC's
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:38.100]   And they've developed the kind of things we you have to think of like the Gracie's
[02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:41.500]   Just a small family was able to develop so much so quickly
[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:45.580]   I I often as this this discussion with Johnny
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:52.980]   I think it's very important like to mention I ask you it very several time like what would happen if we would take a
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:59.020]   Fighter of modern days facing the champion of pancreas. This is an interesting question
[02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:04.940]   You brought something incredible a good point and people don't don't realize it, you know, yeah
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:11.340]   no, I think one of the great tragedies of martial arts history is our loss of
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:17.020]   The historical records of pancreas like most of what we know is
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:21.820]   From what I'm told is actually lost in the fires of the Library of Alexandria
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:25.820]   And we're left with only a pitiful amount of information on
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:28.180]   pancreas images
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:32.660]   But what we do know is that there was a very large
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:38.420]   Participation in the sport and that it was widely considered the most popular
[02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:45.100]   Sport in the ancient Olympics and that it was represented in the ancient Olympics for many hundreds of years
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:51.820]   Plus a long period of time before its introduction into the ancient Olympics. And so the development time
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:55.580]   That it may have had would have been very significant it
[02:06:55.580 --> 02:07:02.980]   As far as we know most of the development would have been in the major Greek city-states for
[02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:06.180]   literally hundreds of years of development
[02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:11.320]   Given its prestige as an Olympic sport then the best athletes would have been doing it
[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:17.620]   Some of the sharpest minds that we know of in human history were involved in the sport
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:20.860]   Plato the great philosopher
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:28.060]   Was a pancreas in his youth in fact his name Plato is a nickname
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:34.340]   Platos is like plate. It means broad or big guy like the big guy and
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:40.220]   He spoke often about pancreas and in his written works
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:44.420]   Imagine people with the intelligence of Plato
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:47.820]   thinking about
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:52.260]   Grappling technique for hundreds of years in the most popular Olympic sport of that time
[02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:55.380]   significant numbers of people with
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:59.580]   Financial backing as city-states put great prestige upon an Olympic success
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:01.580]   They would have funneled athletes in
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:07.300]   Bought in the best coaches and they had that for many hundreds of years like it's quite conceivable
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:12.700]   that the best pancreas athletes were of the absolute first quality and
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:19.780]   It it's it's so sad to think we'll never know what was their skill level and
[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:24.060]   It's interesting to think about what kind of techniques had developed whether
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:29.020]   There's stuff we haven't discovered yet in class. You're talking about the most effective
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:36.060]   Take down strategy in wrestling and collegiate wrestling. So maybe let me ask first because we offline talked about this, too
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:40.380]   What is the highest percentage submission in grappling overall?
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:44.120]   You have to go with the rear naked strangle strangles from the back
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:50.780]   If you look at most tournaments most rule sets it has success across all rule sets
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:54.540]   all weight divisions all body types
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:59.860]   It doesn't require any kind of specific physical advantage such as height
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.380]   in order to be effective
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:05.780]   It works equally well in both fighting and grappling
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:11.860]   It will work regardless of how physically and mentally tough your opponent is
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:17.220]   Okay, a heel hook is a very high percentage technique in in modern-day competition
[02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:23.840]   But if your opponent simply makes up his mind that he's not going to tap and is willing to take the physical damage
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.460]   it won't result in the end of a match a stranglehold by
[02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:32.900]   Contrast will always in the match regardless of your opponent's mental toughness
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:34.580]   so
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:39.420]   I believe it's fair to say that at the end of the day the single most high percentage
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.740]   method of
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:47.180]   Submitting people and grappling is a renegade strength. So when you look at an athlete maybe Gordon you could speak to this like what?
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:49.420]   What's the best?
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:55.660]   You mentioned Gary with the guillotine. What's the best submission to really invest in is it the rear naked choke?
[02:09:56.180 --> 02:10:01.100]   To really invest your development like understanding the entirety of the system that leads into that
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:03.940]   I think that I mean you have to do them all obviously
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:08.340]   But if I had like one submission that I would only one submission I could pick for the rest of my life
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:10.340]   It would definitely be a rear naked
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:15.460]   Can you explain maybe some of the actual technical details of why that's the case?
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:19.860]   well as John spoke about they're different in joint locks, whereas
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:25.440]   You don't have to tap you can just let your leg break and then keep going with the strangled is
[02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:27.460]   there's no
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:30.180]   There's none of that and then it's just an inherent
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:33.300]   Advantage you have being behind someone
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:38.500]   Whereas if you go for an arm bar you stop you start from top mount and you're facing the guy then you put them down
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:41.520]   And you're not directly behind them with leg locks. You're facing the guy
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:46.460]   Whereas when you're on someone's back you have them in a pin where you can your chest the back
[02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:50.020]   You have a body triangle and you you're paying the guy in place. He can't explode out
[02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:52.020]   He can't grease his way out most of the time
[02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:59.140]   And there's an inherent advantage you have being behind them due to the fact that we're poorly set up to deal with threats behind us
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:04.540]   So would you say that's the most dominant position you get to like more than mount?
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:11.260]   More than yeah sack control. I think if you look at most matches historically
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:16.380]   Most guys who get stuck in positions for long amounts of time are guys that they're back taken
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:22.660]   If you get an explosive guy from bottom mounting and bridge and he can off-balance you and lock half guard
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:25.940]   Maybe and then work back to guard but someone locks a body triangle on your back
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.700]   That's where you see most guys getting pinned in place for long amounts of time
[02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:34.740]   Was uh was the body triangle like a well understood thing?
[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:39.560]   was that an invention at some point like as a system as a
[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.820]   Perhaps some of your listeners can correct me on this
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:47.680]   But I believe there was a technique banned in judo called doji main
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:54.700]   Which involved crossing feet or locking a triangle around the abdominals from the back and it was banned in judo
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:12:01.540]   I believe because of intestinal injuries which occurred in the early developmental days of
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:03.820]   judo and
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:11.100]   In the modern era when I first began jiu-jitsu body triangles were relatively rare. They were not a standard part of class
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:13.460]   and
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:19.940]   Sometime around the late 1990s early 2000s people started to realize that this is a stronger method of control
[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:28.940]   It it greatly increases the amount of control you have over your opponents hips and torso over regular hooks
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:36.540]   It's not for all athletes. It's difficult for most people who are of shorter thicker statute to
[02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:43.300]   Employ on on big people if your opponent is very broadly built through the stomach. It's almost impossible to apply and
[02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:49.500]   So because it can't be applied by all people it tends not to be taught much at beginner level
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:53.960]   so as a result, it was always seen as a
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:13:01.580]   Kind of a specialist move for taller athletes at a higher level of competition rather than a broad-based move for everyone
[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:08.500]   Or every body type in every class to employ so it just didn't get emphasized that much but in top level competition now
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:15.780]   I think you would see that it's very apparent that the vast majority of athletes whenever they have the opportunity or a choice between
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:17.860]   body triangle and
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:22.100]   Regular rear mounts the majority of modern athletes would choose a body triangle
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:29.260]   So we also had this conversation about wrestling maybe Georgie can comment on like what's the the highest percentage?
[02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:37.020]   Not statistically speaking perhaps that's also interesting as John talked about but just for you in terms of mastery of a takedown
[02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:40.100]   What's what's the best way to take it down a human being?
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:42.900]   in wrestling well I
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:49.460]   Personally for me it depends for every fighter are different. They have a different set of skill
[02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:53.180]   For me I when I look someone
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:57.940]   Want to bring down a tree a big strong high tree
[02:13:57.940 --> 02:14:00.660]   He cut it from the base
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:04.100]   So the legs that that's what we stand on
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:09.820]   So it was to attack the leg, but is it single leg double leg is it we talked about like?
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:17.140]   Well, there's also the the John Smith low single. Yeah, actually I don't even know if that's applicable for digits at all
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:20.900]   You can use it, but it runs at the problem with submission holds
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:21.180]   Yeah
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:28.940]   It's it's not impossible to use but without shoes and in a situation where there's a whole plethora of submission holds in the scoring
[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:30.620]   that
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:32.620]   It's a little more difficult to use you know
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:38.660]   It is interesting something being a high percentage in terms of effectiveness tells a story
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:44.100]   You're saying that every athlete is different, but if it's more effective for most people I
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:51.960]   Mean it's interesting. It's it's interesting what John talked about is that the highest percentage thing is actually
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:15:01.140]   In collegiate wrestling that he was talking about is on the defensive side so blocking a takedown and spinning around to the to the back
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:09.060]   So that's an interesting idea then also. There's all of these kind of going in for a singleness switching to a double or
[02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:15.100]   Wizard position and doing knee tap like there's all these kinds of combinations that seem to be
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:21.100]   Effective when you look at the statistics, and it seems like there's maybe it's a scientific way of thinking, but it seems like there's
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:29.060]   Some conclusion to be drawn there. Oh, yeah, I believe you need to the high percentage move. There's a reason why they works
[02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:33.540]   I think it's it's made for a bigger amount of people
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:36.820]   For example I one of my main
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:39.020]   strength
[02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:45.640]   Athletic strength is I'm an explosive person so I'll use technique that are explosive if I got a single leg my
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:49.380]   One of my thing I like to do is to go for the double power double
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:51.780]   but for
[02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:58.540]   Someone else we got for example in a single leg position. Maybe he likes like body true better
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:03.460]   He's more a Greco guy like so or he's a judo guy. He's gonna go for something something else so
[02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:10.780]   But there is move that are I would say like you just mentioned are universal like statistically speaking. They're
[02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:17.120]   The highest percentage move that works for pretty much everybody everybody pretty much can do a
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:19.900]   Adeka Jimmy, you know it's very easy
[02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:24.500]   But it's not everybody that can lock a triangle with their legs
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:32.700]   So so those move like a real naked choke and I got Jimmy's the highest percentage move because it's maybe more accessible
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:39.740]   It's accessible for a bigger range of yeah based on the physical characteristics of the people do you draw on your wisdom from these high?
[02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:44.700]   Percentages John for like in terms of what to focus on yeah, absolutely
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:49.420]   Jiu-jitsu has an ocean of moves and you can get lost on that ocean
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:54.100]   You can drift for a long period of time and and that was very little to show for it
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:57.860]   so my whole thing is focus we only live one lifetime and
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:01.540]   Your training lifetime is even shorter than your actual lifetime
[02:17:01.940 --> 02:17:06.020]   So in that time I must die on the mat
[02:17:06.020 --> 02:17:14.500]   I I put a very high value on
[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:18.540]   Choosing what I believe to be the most high percentage
[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:23.260]   Moves and putting an extraordinary amount of focus on them
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:30.740]   The only problem is that in one generation a move which can be considered low percentage might actually turn out to be high
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:32.780]   Percentage in another generation for example
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:38.820]   we talked earlier about leg locks when I was first out of judice if they were considered the ultimate low percentage move and
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:43.660]   a big part of my career has been convincing people that in fact that was
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:48.700]   That was incorrect that they can be a high percentage move if we just change our approach to them
[02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:57.660]   So we can't just follow tradition and say oh, this is low percentage. This is a high percentage. It has to be part of a
[02:17:58.220 --> 02:18:00.300]   fairly systematic study where you
[02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:02.180]   investigate
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:08.460]   What are the reasons why it's high percentage or low percentage with regards to takedowns?
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:13.780]   If you look at what we can consider the most high percentage takedowns
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:19.100]   If you're in front of someone the single most high percentage way of taking them down is to get a hold of both of their legs
[02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:20.740]   And push them backwards
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:24.060]   Okay, if you get a hold of one of their legs and put a force on them
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:29.820]   They can use their other leg to defend themselves and hop around and funk their way out of takedowns and cause all kinds of problems
[02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:34.180]   For you. I don't care how athletic your opponent is if you get a hold a firm grip of
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:38.740]   Both of his legs and start pushing him backwards. He's gonna fall down to his butt now
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:41.140]   He might be able to recover from there, but he will fall down
[02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:44.820]   Even easier than that is to be behind someone
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:50.860]   Takedowns from in front of someone are difficult you go right into their hips their head their hands
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:57.460]   You go into all their defensive weapons if you're already behind someone and you're doing what in America they were referred to as a mat return
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:04.860]   This is significantly easier than taking someone down from the front if you have control of their head in a front headlock position
[02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:11.140]   You've already closed distance on your opponent. You already have close contact. You don't have to worry about shooting anymore
[02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:14.940]   There's no sprawl out of that. You don't have to worry about guillotines Kimura's or the
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:20.100]   Standard defenses those will intrinsically be easier takedowns out of front headlock
[02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:22.780]   And so if we're going to talk about high percentage technique
[02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:29.700]   I always go back to the mechanics of it rather than just historical tradition because historical tradition can be wrong
[02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:36.920]   It was wrong about leg locks. It could be wrong about other things too. So my primary thing is okay. Talk to me about mechanics
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.260]   That's what ultimately is going to determine whether something is high percentage or not
[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:46.180]   Gordon pointed out earlier that when you're behind someone you have innate physical
[02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:52.900]   Advantages over the other guy the human the human body is set up entirely to defend to defend threats from the front
[02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:58.740]   We are poorly adapted to defending threats from the rear. We don't have eyes in the back of our head
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:00.740]   We can't apply pushing strength backwards
[02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:02.780]   If you get behind someone
[02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:07.020]   Takedowns are ten times easier from behind someone than they are when you're in front of someone if
[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:11.160]   You have to take someone down from the front get a hold of both of their legs
[02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:16.260]   If you can get a hold of both of the legs and a part of pushing force, you will almost always knock them down
[02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:19.100]   if
[02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:21.100]   you can get a hold of their head and
[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:23.460]   Work takedowns from there again
[02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:29.540]   It's much easier because most of their defensive apparatus has been taken away from them before the takedown even begins
[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:35.280]   And so for me the most high percentage takedowns will always be from the front double legs
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:40.180]   From any takedown from the back is going to be significantly easier than any takedown from the front
[02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:45.140]   so all manner of mat return takedowns are going to be very high percentage and
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:49.860]   Takedowns done out of situations where the opponent is broken down in front of you
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:55.460]   And you have either front headlock or front chest wrap position are going to be significantly easier than takedowns from the open
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:58.660]   Of course you have to consider the full
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:06.700]   Spectrum of mechanics involved here. It's possible that an outside low single leading to a double leg is much higher percentage
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:12.140]   I think there's a lot of chain wrestling yet, you know that needs to be considered as a possibility
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:14.780]   Maybe a straight on double and part of this cultural too
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:20.900]   Are people afraid of this kind of thing that they came to be the case with leg locks are people aware of this?
[02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:25.140]   are they worried about this are they training for this to defend this and
[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:28.460]   And then this opponent specific, of course that
[02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:36.380]   You know with Jordan Burroughs people are preparing for the double which is why he had to develops a whole other kinds of different stuff
[02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:41.500]   And then the head to all the different controls all the different ties within the rule set
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:47.380]   And that's where it's so fascinating to see the effect of rule set on all of this judo over the past
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:54.340]   I think 20 years went through this every Olympics different changes to the rule set like fundamentally different
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:59.100]   In terms of what's allowed to grip whether you're allowed to touch the legs at all. That was a big one in
[02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:01.860]   2012 I think
[02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:04.700]   And that changes the sport completely and so interesting
[02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:09.740]   It's so interesting to watch how a tiny change in the rule can change the sport
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:13.940]   at the highest when you're talking about people competing at the highest level and
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:16.820]   the cool thing there is
[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:20.740]   The rule change happens on a scale of every four years
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:26.820]   So you get to see people that are at the top of their game have to like recompute
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:31.540]   So it's not like you have a new generation of people coming up with the rules. I have to figure out shit
[02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:36.740]   You're not allowed to like it's the equivalent of saying you're not allowed to kick anymore in MMA
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:40.540]   Because you were not allowed to grab legs anymore in judo
[02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:43.540]   interestingly if you look at the
[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:47.900]   case of judo if you look at the world rankings of
[02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:51.620]   athletes when they went through one of the most
[02:22:51.620 --> 02:22:57.180]   Significant rule changes in judo history where they banned any form of grabbing the legs
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:01.340]   The ranking of athletes didn't change much
[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:06.460]   Yeah that tells you that there there's a reason why those guys are at the top
[02:23:06.460 --> 02:23:09.900]   Yeah, and it doesn't have to do that. There's specific to a rule set
[02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:16.500]   Yeah, think about that in terms of imagine for example in mixed martial arts if they just said hey
[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:22.340]   Starting next week instead of having three five-minute rounds. It's gonna be 15 minutes straight
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:26.700]   That would massively change the preparation of the athletes
[02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:34.260]   It's a different game at that point and judo literally was a different game before 2010 and after 2010 and yet
[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:40.060]   The international rankings didn't really change that much the countries that were dominant before
[02:23:40.060 --> 02:23:45.740]   Remain dominant the athletes that remain before largely remain the same
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:52.620]   you would think was such a massive change all the rankings would have been thrown upside down, but they weren't and
[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:58.700]   Again, it goes back to this idea that there's a reason why the guys at the top are at the top
[02:23:58.700 --> 02:24:06.060]   And now for something completely different we talked about aliens earlier. Yeah, so George brought up Bob Lazar. I
[02:24:06.060 --> 02:24:11.380]   Will likely probably talk to Bob Lazar on this podcast and then
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:20.060]   And then John had this a skeptical look on his face about Bob out aliens. So let me ask John and Gordon
[02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:28.060]   Do you think there's intelligent alien civilizations out there in the universe outside of our own? The universe is?
[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:35.460]   unimaginably large the idea that we are the only life forms and a cosmos as large as this is
[02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:39.460]   I think naive and foolish
[02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:47.020]   There's a very high likelihood that if life could evolve on this planet that it could have done
[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:51.100]   So on many many other planets around the around the cosmos
[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:58.860]   I think anyone who puts even a moment's thought into this would realize that there's almost certainly other forms of life out there
[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:03.300]   the real question with regards the alien community is
[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:11.900]   Have they got here and now they circling our planet and little silver saucers and making observations and periodically
[02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:18.620]   Stealing people for experimentation purposes. There's a whole silver saucers. It could be different other color saucers
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:24.620]   And that question I'm I'm not at all convinced. No, I didn't recently
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:28.340]   Navy footage has come out showing
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:33.800]   Some very interesting phenomena if you talk to almost any experienced pilot
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:39.060]   They will tell you they've seen things in the upper atmosphere that are very difficult to explain
[02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:44.460]   I'll be the first one to agree with you on this. There are some things out there that are extremely difficult to explain
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:46.460]   It's literally UFOs
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.020]   Unidentified. Yeah, I mean we just don't know what they are
[02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:53.760]   but to go from the idea that there's things out there that we don't understand to
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:55.940]   this
[02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:58.940]   like little creatures running around and
[02:25:58.940 --> 02:26:02.180]   and these somehow exist I
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:08.140]   Just reserve judgment. I just say I'm agnostic about these things. I think it's possible but
[02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:14.940]   All the evidence that I've been shown so far was insufficient to come to any kind of definite conclusions until
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:22.580]   Aliens land in Central Park on Tuesday afternoon at 3 p.m. And get out with little alien ray guns and start shooting people
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:24.180]   I don't believe in
[02:26:24.180 --> 02:26:29.700]   Many of the stories that get told well, what about if it's not little aliens with ray guns
[02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:34.580]   But something very different very very difficult to detect for us humans. That's very human
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:39.820]   Then at that point it's a it's a fascinating idea and it's certainly possible but show me the evidence
[02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:43.500]   All right, what about you Gordon
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:47.420]   Do you do you look at the cosmos and ponder the stars?
[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:51.160]   Often I think it's fair points John raised
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:53.900]   something really interesting I saw the other day was a
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:58.820]   someone posted like if an alien organ or civilization
[02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:04.260]   65 million light-years away somehow managed to look at earth
[02:27:04.260 --> 02:27:10.660]   They would theoretically see the dinosaurs because there's 65 million light-years away. So like imagine us looking at
[02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:15.840]   Galaxies that are 100 million light-years away. That's a hundred million years ago. You have no idea what it looks like now
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:18.100]   So that's what's super interesting to me about it
[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:24.780]   yeah, the the expanse is huge and so much cool stuff could be going out there and
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:29.180]   The scary thing of course is if they haven't visited us yet
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:31.300]   the
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:33.300]   there has to be a good reason for it and
[02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:40.380]   The set of scary reasons of all the fact that they maybe once it gets sufficiently advanced in your development
[02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:43.940]   You destroy yourself naturally as humans seem to be approaching now
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:47.700]   We more and more have the tools to destroy ourselves completely
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:50.260]   in terms of our weapon systems
[02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:54.980]   and we're developing them more and more and they're becoming better and better and
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:59.460]   Then we're starting to get angry and angrier on Twitter and Instagram at each other. Oh
[02:27:59.460 --> 02:28:02.500]   Those are good points. You're raising
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:05.500]   History has taught us that
[02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:10.300]   Everything that lives one day will die. So we will perish one day. Yeah
[02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:13.580]   it's also just the the sheer difficulty of
[02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:16.580]   of
[02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:22.580]   Travel through space like space is an unimaginably inhospitable environment and
[02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:25.300]   to the best of our knowledge
[02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:32.500]   This even the theoretical speeds that we can attain in space even if we could
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:36.900]   Travel at the speed of light. We're not even remotely close to that
[02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:43.180]   Still the distances that need to be traveled to get to even relatively close solar systems
[02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:46.340]   very very long if you look at
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:54.300]   Astronauts who have spent significant amounts of time in space just orbiting the earth it has severe health effects on them
[02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:58.340]   We just not built for space. We're supposed to be in a gravitational environment
[02:28:58.340 --> 02:29:06.180]   But we you're referring to your biological meat bag that's containing the essence of the mind. That is John Donahue
[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:08.180]   Maybe we can transfer the mind
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:10.260]   alone
[02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:14.580]   The bag the meat the meat bag is not designed for space but maybe the car again
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:22.340]   This is all that's of the mind. It's it's possible. But what do you think of concrete evidence? You folks who like difficult things?
[02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:27.420]   What do you think about Elon Musk going to colonize Mars
[02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:32.220]   is this something you find an interesting or a
[02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:39.620]   Aimless pursuit I think it's a must or a salvation
[02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:46.180]   We need to leave at some point a planet because historically in the past we know that we've been bombarded by asteroid
[02:29:46.180 --> 02:29:47.980]   volcano
[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:52.900]   They're crazy things happen here. It's very unstable. You know, we if you look at it to
[02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:58.860]   Lifetime of a human being it's nothing but just look 12,000 years ago what happened, you know
[02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:03.420]   So there is cataclysm that happened all the time. It's very unstable
[02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:06.020]   So if we want to survive as a species
[02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:11.460]   I think it's it's we need to get out to be able to get out and spread our seed
[02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:16.260]   so these are the early steps on a really long journey, but is there something about like
[02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:24.820]   You know, we don't get that exploration from most of modern society, you know the kind of exploring that people did throughout the centuries of
[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:27.340]   you know coming to the
[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:33.180]   North America just throughout we were shrouded in physical uncertainty of what's out there
[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:36.900]   And now we get to do the same kind of exploration with Mars
[02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:44.140]   Is there so I mean is there any aspect of you that wants to travel out to space that wants to travel to Mars?
[02:30:44.140 --> 02:30:48.220]   There you know, the goal is to allow civilians to travel
[02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:50.940]   Perhaps in our lifetime
[02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:53.740]   Meaning affordably you can do so now unaffordably
[02:30:53.740 --> 02:30:59.900]   Traveling to space and traveling to Mars are two different things. I think I would like to travel into space
[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:04.700]   I don't know if I would like to travel all the way to Mars because of the risks involved
[02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:07.700]   just cuz
[02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:10.380]   Boring. Is there some part of you that enjoys?
[02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:12.380]   I think that if I was like towards the end of my life
[02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:17.540]   I would like to travel to Mars just just just the experience. Yeah, but if I go to Mars, I'm not coming back
[02:31:17.540 --> 02:31:19.300]   I think that's it
[02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:21.300]   one-way ticket
[02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:24.180]   Hey with the technology we have now maybe in the future
[02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:31.980]   Maybe our the children of our children will will be able to to experience that to go to well the weekend
[02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:39.500]   Well, the whole design of the Starship that the SpaceX is working on it's supposed to come back
[02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:44.580]   It's supposed to be reusable. So it's not it's not a one-way ticket. That's the whole point
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:51.580]   It's always going back and forth back and forth. What's the time frame between two planets like to travel from?
[02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:54.900]   I think the current thing you'd be stuck on Mars for two years
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:32:00.300]   But how long does it take to get from Earth to Mars? Oh, it's pretty I'm not exactly sure but it's pretty quick
[02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:05.580]   It's pretty quick. Like I don't know and the scale of months not scale of years
[02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:10.420]   You might not be healthy when you come back, you know all the astronaut they experience health issues
[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:16.740]   You know, they lose a lot of muscle mass bone density. So yeah, I don't think the technology is good right now. I mean
[02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:22.300]   Let's say that it is I would love to be doing it for a weekend if it's safe
[02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:27.180]   I would be the first one to do a professional fighter who sacrifices body
[02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:32.460]   Something so there's some sacrifice we do in life, right? I would don't want to be the first
[02:32:32.460 --> 02:32:36.120]   I wouldn't want to I leave the other one, but when I know it's it's safe
[02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:40.660]   Okay, count me in. So one of the things that people say and this is something I wonder about is
[02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:42.780]   It's like having children or something
[02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:47.780]   Once you see once you're out in space and you look out and you see Earth you look back at Earth
[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:52.020]   That's an experience. It's unlike anything else like you can't replicate it here
[02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:57.900]   Is to look back at that like blue dot and that nerve-wracking
[02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:02.780]   You see like Earth disappear into the distance
[02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:03.560]   Yeah
[02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:04.260]   Yeah
[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:11.060]   Disappear into the distance and then you get to actually stand on Mars and see and just to look you're standing on the ground and
[02:33:11.060 --> 02:33:16.180]   You're looking out and you see the planet from which you came and where you might not be coming back
[02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:19.980]   but there's a challenge to the whole thing where the risk is tremendous and
[02:33:19.980 --> 02:33:26.600]   I don't know. I find that risk really compelling for some reason but that could be just the exploration
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:30.040]   Look, I guess that's a genetic thing to how much do you want to explore?
[02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:34.180]   There's a sense though in which even in the best-case scenario
[02:33:34.180 --> 02:33:38.940]   where they did get the technology to whisk you to Mars and if in a
[02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:45.220]   fairly short period of time it's kind of an inauthentic sense of exploration because
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:47.780]   your participation in it is
[02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:51.380]   no more exciting than your
[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:58.980]   Participation in an airline flight to a foreign country. You're basically you didn't have anything to do with the creation of the vessel
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:04.580]   You're not in command of the vessel. You're not in any way shape or form important to the mission
[02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:09.940]   You're just a person sitting in a passenger seat and you get off in a destination the same way you would if you flew to
[02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:11.940]   Singapore or London or someplace like that
[02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:17.260]   Well, there's a hierarchy of there's a leadership and then there's a bunch of people and they all have roles
[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:23.280]   You don't go to Mars without having a subscript set to go to be you've made it sound like space tourism
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:29.740]   Where you just yeah, I don't I think it's a long time before you have space tourism to Mars. We have nothing to contribute
[02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:35.220]   Okay, like you will have to tell what you do you go through like a training program you go training program
[02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:39.540]   And then there's there's technical things you'll be contributing so there they would bring people
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:43.820]   You know in terms of agriculture, I don't know. Okay, so this is this is better
[02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:47.940]   This sounds like they're actual they're more like explorers. Like if you talked before about
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:54.940]   Explorers and human history where Magellan sets off on his boat and every person on the boat had a specific function
[02:34:54.940 --> 02:34:56.820]   They were they were all
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:35:02.180]   Into the mission in a very authentic fashion if they weren't on the boat the performance of the crew would somehow suffer
[02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:08.580]   So that this sounds much better and with just would like with Magellan. I think most of the crew died a
[02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:11.180]   significant number did yeah
[02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:14.100]   And from
[02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:20.100]   Yeah from bacteria, I mean from things that are unexpected and so on and if we discover life on Mars
[02:35:20.100 --> 02:35:24.880]   I mean who knows what that entails because that's like a manned mission to Mars
[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:28.860]   would likely be very driven by the research to do all the kind of
[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:33.840]   Exploration required to find life now from
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:37.020]   Mr. Musk's
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:41.740]   Point of view as a developer presumably there has to be some kind of financial incentive here, too
[02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:47.620]   Is there some kind of financial benefit to Mars missions is is?
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:50.860]   presumably
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:57.300]   There wouldn't be that many people on earth that could afford a ticket to pay for the kind of research and development that would require
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:36:01.540]   This is there some kind of mining on Mars of minerals that would be useful
[02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:03.220]   I think there's a lot of answers to this
[02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:08.500]   But the only honest answer is the one with it looks back into human history where we did a lot of things just because we
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:13.660]   could a lot of hard things just because we could and that led to a lot of
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:18.980]   Innovation that ultimately made our life better. So this is more. This is why you have NASA
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:25.580]   This is why you have government organizations. Like what's the purpose of NASA NASA would answer that by saying, okay. Well, we're helping
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:32.100]   Launch satellites up there all that. They'll have a bunch of answers. But the reality is the programs
[02:36:32.100 --> 02:36:34.100]   were
[02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:38.100]   funded in large part by our desire to explore the unknown and
[02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:43.540]   There's some aspect to which we have to all invest into that because historically speaking
[02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:52.580]   That has produced a lot of cool things along the way. They were totally unexpected like but NASA is funded by public funding the taxpayer
[02:36:52.580 --> 02:37:01.000]   How is mr. Musk going to fund this? Well currently most of the funding was the SpaceX is NASA giving
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.860]   money
[02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:04.140]   to
[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:09.380]   So they're making a competition who can who can get our satellites. We need to go to
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:13.460]   You know was for the space station to
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:19.620]   Resupply the space station or we need to launch satellites up who's going to carry those quote-unquote payloads
[02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:22.900]   They just need so NASA's paying whoever the heck wants to
[02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:25.100]   get
[02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:27.820]   Kilograms of thing up into space
[02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:32.220]   Why did this is NASA's specialty? Why did they just give up on that?
[02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:35.020]   Well, they why they realized where mr
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:39.900]   Musk came along and then Bezos and others that said we can do it for one-tenth the price
[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:46.020]   So why did the why should the taxpayers pay for the why don't you NASA do what you do?
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:53.060]   Well, which is like test out cutting-edge stuff make sure they're safe. And now that we've developed
[02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:55.500]   a car
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:58.780]   Let us let us UPS and FedEx take care of
[02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:01.740]   Doing this at scale doing it cheaper doing it better
[02:38:01.740 --> 02:38:07.580]   I mean, that's the argument and NASA took what they realize is it took way way too long to do stuff
[02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:13.060]   when you're investing millions as billions of dollars into a project the
[02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:20.260]   Debris rocker see builds up and the conservatism builds up to where you're I mean, you really have to test everything out
[02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:25.500]   So projects take years and then you have somebody like Elon Musk coming along and says well, let's do
[02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:27.460]   launches every
[02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:32.840]   Every week and as opposed to just throwing away the rocket will reuse the rocket
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:38.100]   That was one of the sort of cutting-edge inventions. It's a dumb obvious idea
[02:38:38.100 --> 02:38:44.140]   Like Elon says why do you throw away the place? The equivalent is if you flew a plane every time you threw it away
[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:46.740]   Why are we every time throwing away the plane?
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:51.460]   But NASA's tried that kind of thing with the space shuttle since the 1970s and yes
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:58.340]   well, they did that with the space shuttle, but not not at the scale here that it was the space shuttle was seen as this like
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:07.100]   Majestic amazing thing that requires a huge amount of investment with the Elon Musk is like no every basic rocket should be reusable
[02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:11.260]   Next cut cost cut cost. Do you do you think like?
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:15.140]   The more technology we have the more advanced we become the more
[02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:22.200]   Specialized we need to be like is that for that reason that now they there is different branch like you just explained out now
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:28.460]   There's other specializing this but they left, you know other branch. Yeah, there's there's the greater and greater specializations
[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:30.820]   we build up more stuff, which is fascinating because
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:34.420]   Is it making us more?
[02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:40.380]   Dumb in a way. Do you think like like like yeah, I don't know like you you know
[02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:43.980]   But I use a cell phone, but I don't know how to build it up from there
[02:39:43.980 --> 02:39:47.700]   I mean, it's that beta males building up this whole society
[02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:53.060]   because we're this collective intelligence we rely on each other more and more and
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:59.660]   it I do also see sort of the rise of conspiracy theories and all those kinds of things because
[02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:07.420]   Like I've been talking to a few folks about flat earth recently it's fascinating it's fascinating
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:10.100]   there's a large community of people that believe the earth is flat and
[02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:14.780]   That idea takes hold in this day and age of all the ideas
[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:18.860]   that's the one that takes hold for a large number of people and I
[02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:24.540]   Think that's a consequence is this this kind of specialization where it's just huge amount of experts
[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:30.100]   But if you look out into our world and try to reason simply about our existence
[02:40:30.100 --> 02:40:36.220]   We are losing the skills to do that because more and more people are specialized as opposed to general thinkers
[02:40:36.220 --> 02:40:44.060]   We're like extremely good at specific things. Are we capable now to do a robot that is self-aware?
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:47.220]   There that's that's one the legged one. I mean
[02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:51.780]   It's self-aware like not self-aware has been listening, but it's not self-aware
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:56.420]   But do you think a human being is self-aware or that's a good question?
[02:40:56.420 --> 02:41:01.500]   I mean I ask this question all the time when the robots move. There's a sense of
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:09.940]   When they turn on something entered that robot Wow, and when it turns off something left
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:16.940]   If they move in a certain kind of way and if they're if they surprise you there's certain elements that
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:19.300]   enable us
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:21.300]   to see the magic in
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:26.900]   In a living being and some of them. I mean we can care we can maybe list them
[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:30.780]   but it's the ability to surprise you it's the
[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:38.420]   Ability to make mistakes and learn from them visibly there's a bunch of things that you just I
[02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:43.860]   don't know it just feels like it has the magic of what is a living being and
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:49.860]   Which is what humans have and I try to think about how do you replicate that into a machine?
[02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:56.740]   So when you turn it on enough you feel like it dies every time and the reborn so for most machines
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:59.380]   We don't feel that way. We don't when we unplug things
[02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:06.220]   We don't feel that way. I don't know why we don't feel that way. That's an interesting question, but I think when
[02:42:06.220 --> 02:42:10.580]   When the robot has certain qualities
[02:42:10.580 --> 02:42:13.620]   like memory
[02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:15.620]   Like ability to recognize you
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:19.400]   Yeah, you start to feel like you're turning off an organism
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:23.060]   so so whenever I have like the robots that recognize me and
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:28.220]   Remember, this is important that all the things we've experienced together
[02:42:28.220 --> 02:42:30.940]   Then it's like holy shit
[02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:37.540]   That's a that's a living thing. But does it feels it feels like a living thing. Does he remember your robot?
[02:42:37.540 --> 02:42:43.300]   Does he remember things that happened before you unplugged in is it like he's sleeping?
[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:48.580]   Like you wake up or is he like that? So right now it start to zero everything
[02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:54.620]   No, it doesn't start as you remember remembers everything. That's the key every time you like you you unplug Wow
[02:42:54.620 --> 02:43:00.700]   It's storing the storing the memory, but the memories are basic. They're like, okay, we walked around the kitchen and then
[02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:07.980]   You looked at me I mean the memories it's like data it's just it's not like we've experienced it's able to actually
[02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:13.380]   Experience anything deep like we humans can but just the fact of memory
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:20.340]   It's like the toaster or the microwave. Don't don't give a shit about me. They don't know me
[02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:25.340]   They don't know me by name. They wouldn't recognize my face as being different from Gordon's
[02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:31.780]   They wouldn't know the difference and they wouldn't remember the microwave currently doesn't remember, you know
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:36.260]   The times I've been sad or happy like what food I put into it
[02:43:36.260 --> 02:43:41.660]   it doesn't remember this when I was being a fat ass or what I was being in good shape and all
[02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:46.100]   Just those memories are enough to make you feel when you turn a thing off
[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:53.380]   It's like shit. That's a living. That's that that's a living thing disappearing. Of course. That's kind of an anthropomorphism
[02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:55.420]   We do to each other
[02:43:55.420 --> 02:44:02.140]   But that's something is you know that that's something that makes me believe it's possible to create
[02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:10.980]   Systems with which we can have a connection that are non-human like similar to dogs and cats and so on
[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:17.020]   Just makes me and that's what's interesting to me because ultimately I feel like they'll help us understand
[02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:19.660]   ourselves
[02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:22.520]   And maybe practice grappling moves anyway
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:29.160]   Well, let me ask the advice question
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:33.980]   Now that we're together I've asked I've spoken to John I spoke to George
[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:38.660]   What what advice would you give to young folks whether we're talking about?
[02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:44.220]   Sport like excelling becoming great at grappling becoming great at fighting
[02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:50.380]   Become a great at whatever sport they take on or life in general whether there may be in high school or in college
[02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:52.820]   What advice would you give them to?
[02:44:52.820 --> 02:44:55.100]   excel at
[02:44:55.100 --> 02:45:00.860]   That thing they take on I don't know if I'm qualified to answer this because I'm only 26
[02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:04.340]   So you said you're at the top. He said you said giving advice to young people
[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:07.980]   For me, I think the two biggest things are
[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:12.380]   Find something that you're both talented in and you enjoy
[02:45:12.380 --> 02:45:17.180]   I think that if you enjoy something, but you're terrible at it
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:21.460]   It's gonna be hard for you to be successful in life at that given in that given area
[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:26.480]   And it's going to be hard to do something for long amounts of time
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:30.340]   If you're talented at it, but you don't enjoy doing it
[02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:32.900]   it's easy to come in and
[02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:37.620]   Train hard for a month or for two months or for a year
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:39.420]   You can be very talented at it
[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:42.420]   But if you come in it's but it's a different story to come in
[02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:46.180]   Every day for five years in a row for ten years in a row for 15 years in a row
[02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:48.460]   so I think I
[02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:51.140]   think finding something that you're both talented in and
[02:45:51.140 --> 02:45:57.420]   Something you enjoy are probably the two biggest things for me. How do you find the joy in it?
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:02.220]   So you've been training insane amount, you know a lot you've been doing it for a long time
[02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:07.020]   Is there is there ways to rediscover the joy in it? Yeah for me initially
[02:46:07.020 --> 02:46:10.980]   It was just learning new stuff, you know
[02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:15.100]   You just come in as a white belt and every day you learn you see a different move and you're like, oh man
[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:22.340]   It's that's awesome. And then when I started to compete more seriously towards my professional career it was
[02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:28.460]   The joy of doing camps and seeing the result of those camps and beating high-level athletes
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:33.060]   And then it got to a point where I've beaten all the high-level athletes already. So
[02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:35.580]   Who am I gonna compete against?
[02:46:35.580 --> 02:46:37.980]   so now for me the joy is just
[02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:47.020]   Being the best athlete that can possibly be until I reach my prime which I'm hoping is somewhere between 35 and 40
[02:46:47.020 --> 02:46:49.940]   So instead of competing against the other athletes
[02:46:50.620 --> 02:46:53.300]   That would be bored already because I already beat all the rest of the guys
[02:46:53.300 --> 02:46:55.540]   but I
[02:46:55.540 --> 02:47:00.980]   Know that now I know that I can be better in a year from now or two years from now that I am today
[02:47:00.980 --> 02:47:02.980]   And that for me is exciting
[02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:11.220]   By the way, is there some aspect of teaching that's exciting to you? Yeah, I become a better and better teacher over the years
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:14.500]   Yeah. Yeah, I definitely I enjoy teaching and I
[02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:17.220]   used to teach a
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:22.380]   Lot before I met John and that I met John and I was like, yeah, I just have no idea how to teach
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:25.740]   So that's like a completely different element of the sport
[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:33.260]   you know doing things and being good at doing things or being good at winning and actually being able to communicate those skills and knowledge to
[02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:37.020]   To a vast amount of people is two completely different things
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:41.540]   George advice for young people like yourself
[02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:43.740]   well
[02:47:43.740 --> 02:47:46.620]   First I was I would tell them fine
[02:47:47.380 --> 02:47:51.580]   What you want to become what you want to do and long term?
[02:47:51.580 --> 02:47:57.700]   Use certain things maybe sometime you don't love but where you want to propel yourself at the future
[02:47:57.700 --> 02:48:03.180]   Not what your parent your your friend wants you to become what you you you want to become
[02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:05.820]   So one once you find it
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:09.580]   You cannot doing it by yourself
[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:15.060]   Everything that are that is big achievement in life. We cannot do it doing it by ourselves
[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:17.380]   So what I would say is second thing is
[02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:22.500]   Try to build up your team and try to build up your team to be able to achieve your goal
[02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:24.380]   of
[02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:30.820]   people that are competent and people that you trust you need both competency and trust I
[02:48:30.820 --> 02:48:38.740]   Sell out of people sometime in business. For example, they hire people they that are that they trust but they turn out to be incompetent
[02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:42.740]   So now you have to fire a friend or otherwise your business going down
[02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:47.700]   It's same problem. If you do the opposite you are you're someone that is competent, but you cannot trust is gonna
[02:48:47.700 --> 02:48:49.700]   It's gonna screw you, you know
[02:48:49.700 --> 02:48:55.460]   So it's very important to stay away from the negative build up your team people you trust and that are competent
[02:48:55.460 --> 02:49:02.180]   And I would say the third one is to work to work hard to sacrifice yourself
[02:49:02.180 --> 02:49:04.340]   Yeah, you have to go through hell sometime
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:04.700]   But yeah
[02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:09.620]   You have to see the light at the end of it of it, you know to keep your dream in mind
[02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:13.940]   It's gonna give you the motivation to go through the tough time. It's nothing easy to go work work work
[02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:16.020]   It's nothing you can accomplish without hard work
[02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:20.060]   The fourth one I would say
[02:49:20.060 --> 02:49:27.180]   To invest on yourself constantly if you do not invest on yourself on whatever you are in which business and sport
[02:49:27.180 --> 02:49:29.460]   The game will catch up to you
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:31.700]   for example if you're if you become
[02:49:31.700 --> 02:49:38.220]   Champion at something and if you stop improving the other guys that are trying to be champion
[02:49:38.220 --> 02:49:42.420]   They're gonna catch up to you. So you need to invest on yourself and most people
[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:45.620]   Most athlete they make the mistake when they start to have a money
[02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:51.380]   They buy luxury stuff and that's one thing I didn't do when I start making money
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:56.220]   I was investing of on traveling to New York train with John Gordon and the guys to learn
[02:49:56.220 --> 02:50:02.020]   What is new in the the game of Jiu-Jitsu? I used to go in Thailand train Muay Thai
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:07.140]   In Los Angeles to perfect my boxing skill
[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:14.660]   So instead of taking that money to buy me jewelry cars and to do what a lot of guys do because it's a mistake. I
[02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:21.500]   Invested on myself because I know there were people coming. They don't want my place. So I want I didn't want them to catch me
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:26.760]   And the last one I would say it seems weird. I would say
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:34.240]   To give back and it's not because I'm a nice guy and it's not that I don't say that to look good
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:35.880]   I say that
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:37.880]   When you you make it
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:43.440]   It creates opportunity where you can help certain group of people
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:47.920]   But when I say give back not give back to everybody to anybody
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:54.080]   Give back only to the cause that you want I give back not because I'm a nice guy
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:57.760]   I'm kind of it's kind of selfish. I only give back to the people that I want to give back
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:01.940]   Because I give back to them and I know that if I'm more successful
[02:51:01.940 --> 02:51:07.600]   I'm gonna be able to give back to people. I loved the cause that that that count for me
[02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:13.360]   So it's it brings me more motivation because I don't compete for myself anymore
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:16.000]   I compete to help people I love in a way
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:19.720]   So what when you you reach the top in your game?
[02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:26.560]   You need to find new motivation if you're satisfied is is the end of it your success will go down
[02:51:26.760 --> 02:51:30.760]   So you need to to find new motivation. What can motivate you?
[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:34.600]   You know, what do you want? I want to help this so I need to to be successful
[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:39.900]   I want to you know, you need to find reason who you what do you want to do with your success?
[02:51:39.900 --> 02:51:45.680]   So when I say give back it's not because I'm not because I'm necessarily it's not to be to look like a nice guy
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:51.440]   It's to keep your motivation to be able to keep climbing the ladder even more
[02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:54.640]   That's beautiful George
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:56.440]   John
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:52:02.680]   Um first off the two responses given so far covered. I think the most important things or already
[02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:09.320]   Gordon talked about the need for an underlying passion and enjoyment
[02:52:09.320 --> 02:52:13.960]   If you don't have that you're not going to have the longevity that is required in order to build
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:18.640]   Skills, which is ultimately everything's going to come down to your ability to build skills
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:25.880]   You've got to have some kind of underlying passion and enjoyment which will keep you in the game long enough to build world championship skills
[02:52:25.880 --> 02:52:30.280]   It's going to take a minimum of five years and quite possibly considerably longer than that
[02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:35.800]   George talked about the idea of community. You're not going to make it by yourself
[02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:42.960]   So you've got to be able to build people around you and and build a trusting environment around you to develop those skills
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:48.640]   What I would add to the the excellent points that both already raised
[02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:52.000]   Alludes to what I said at the start of this podcast
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.560]   You've got to be able to identify
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:56.880]   some kind of undervalued
[02:52:56.880 --> 02:53:02.960]   Elements in whatever industry you're in and show the world what their true value is in
[02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:05.320]   addition
[02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:07.320]   You can't go through life
[02:53:07.320 --> 02:53:12.840]   Doing the same things as everybody else and expecting to get different results
[02:53:12.840 --> 02:53:17.240]   This is straightforwardly irrational and worse. It's even arrogant
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:21.600]   It's essentially the statement that I'm going to do the same thing as everyone else
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:25.040]   But I believe I'm different and so they'll work for me
[02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:29.240]   But they didn't work for everyone else. That's like saying no, I'm special
[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:33.480]   No, you're not special. We're all pretty much the same and
[02:53:33.480 --> 02:53:40.200]   In order to be special you're going to have to exhibit skills that other people simply don't have
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:47.320]   Thirdly I would say if you want to become something truly impressive in life
[02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:54.120]   You've got to be able to focus on one or two things that you do better than anyone else in your industry
[02:53:54.120 --> 02:54:02.360]   You can't learn everything but you can become one or two skills and the more innovative those skills are the better and
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:07.400]   You can truly excel at them. For example at the peak of his career
[02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:13.080]   No one in the world was better than George St. Pierre at integrating striking and takedowns
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:18.120]   No one in the world was better at integrating grappling and striking on the ground
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:25.800]   He had two things that he could confidently say he was the best in the world at was he the best at every MMA skill?
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:26.880]   nope
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:28.560]   but he was
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:34.080]   Absolutely the best at those two skills and those two skills were skills which he used throughout his career to win
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:36.320]   the vast majority of his matches
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:42.640]   Gordon Ryan at the onset of his career could confidently say there's no one in the world better than me at leg locks
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:47.960]   He could also say there's no one better in the world at me at late-stage defense
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:56.400]   To submission holds across the board as he went through his career. He started adding more and more elements
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:02.920]   It's gotten to an extraordinary degree now where you could absolutely say he's the best at guard passing the best guard retention
[02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:06.280]   the less this keeps going on and that goes back to what
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:14.800]   Gordon said earlier about keeping things interesting over time because we're always introducing new skill sets the day you start saying
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:22.360]   I'm satisfied with my skill set is the day you get bored and bored boredom to an athlete is a precursor to
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:25.880]   Death by boredom
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:29.720]   As long as you're still growing in those directions, you'll stay in the game
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:34.400]   For very long periods of time. So the main thing I would add to these
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:43.720]   Statements by Gordon and George is this idea of finding something which is currently undervalued and showing the world what its true value is
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:48.280]   Understanding that
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:55.160]   You can't just use the same training methodologies as everyone else and somehow expect to be different from everyone else. You've got a
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:01.160]   Almost every great rise in human civilization whether it be groups of people or individuals
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:06.800]   Required some kind of innovation. You've got to look for that new angle. Okay, George st
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:09.040]   Pierre found that was shoot boxing early on in his career
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:15.220]   Gordon Ryan found it with leg locks early on in his career and they branched out from that from that angle
[02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:21.720]   Add to this the idea that you want to become the
[02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:27.320]   Absolute best in the world in your industry and one or two things that make a difference
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:32.040]   Find out what they are and focus on those things and you'll go far
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:38.800]   John Gordon George, this is an incredible conversation. Thank you so much for your
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:43.680]   Extremely valuable time George as somebody who's become famous in part
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:46.500]   by commenting on people's performance
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:53.320]   How do you think we did how would you evaluate our performance today?
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:56.320]   I'm not impressed by
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:05.160]   Learn all the time. I've talked to you guys. I mean, it's great. I loved it. It was very
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:13.000]   Stimulated I and really enjoyed it. Yeah, it's a it was it was something I really was looking forward to I was hoping that we'd get together
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.160]   It's so rare that at the same time in history
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:21.600]   There will be some of the greats together and the fact that you guys would be willing to come together and talk like this
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:26.800]   This is awesome. And that Gordon he would even wear a cowboy hat. I mean, this is just historic
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:32.480]   This is like Churchill getting together with whoever, you know, this is great and all but the next one is just gonna be us
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:37.520]   Just quizzing John on which animals would win in fights. Yes for the whole three hours
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:42.320]   It'll be just so we'll invite Joe and you'll just be we'll make it a systematic
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:47.960]   It'll be a debate between Joe and John on which animal would win John and I we have a thing that we send each other
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:55.480]   Footage all the time of animal fight where we are very intrigued about animal fight
[02:57:55.480 --> 02:58:04.400]   I get them at like 3.30 a.m. on Instagram. He's like check this out. Like a rhino taking a like a pig like
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:10.240]   Like literally like it's not always fair. No, no, it's not ever but interesting stuff
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:15.680]   If you people would see what we send the stuff that we that would judge you harshly
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:19.460]   Alright, thanks so much guys. This is awesome
[02:58:19.460 --> 02:58:27.560]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with George St. Pierre John Donahue and Gordon Ryan to support this podcast
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:34.360]   Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you some words from Miyamoto Musashi
[02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:43.240]   There's nothing outside yourself that can ever enable you to get better stronger richer quicker or smarter
[02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:49.200]   Everything is within everything exists seek nothing outside of yourself
[02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:52.840]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
[02:58:52.840 --> 02:59:02.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
