[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   (applause)
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.920]   >> This one-- these two panelists need no introduction,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.560]   but I'll-- so I'll be short and sweet.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   William Bernstein-- Bill Bernstein
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.520]   is a Bogle Center board member.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.660]   He's a neurologist-turned-financial advisor
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.800]   and author, as many of you know.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.440]   His books are outstanding, and he has written several of them.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.840]   Most recently, he updated what is still my favorite
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840]   Bill Bernstein book, "The Four Pillars of Investing,"
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.100]   came out with a second edition.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.720]   And as Bill has said, the Shakespeare piece of investing
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.480]   and of our financial journeys
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.520]   has taken greater prominence in his latest book.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.460]   Jonathan Clements is also here.
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.220]   He is someone who we always welcome at this conference.
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.400]   Jonathan is an author,
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.900]   long-time columnist at the "Wall Street Journal,"
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.360]   now is in charge of the "Humble Dollar" website,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.240]   where Jonathan makes his own contributions
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840]   and also has a lot of other external contributors
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.480]   who contribute to "Humble Dollar."
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.240]   Most recently, Jonathan presided over a terrific book himself
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.220]   called "My Money Journey,"
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.720]   which is a series of essays from real people
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.760]   about how they found their way to financial wellness.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   So I'm thrilled to introduce these two.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.020]   I just want to make a quick note
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.960]   because I keep forgetting about this.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.500]   We have questions, moderators in the audience here.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.260]   And Mel Turner, he's standing up.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.440]   Mel is one of the original Bogleheads
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.240]   and still a tremendous friend of the Bogleheads
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.880]   and former Bogle Center board member.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.580]   Mel is going to be here moderating your questions.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.040]   He'll be collecting your questions
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.720]   for Jonathan and Bill.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.780]   So thanks to Mel and his wife, Kathy,
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.520]   for always being such a huge part of this event
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   and for being such a huge component
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.320]   of Bogleheads historically.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.260]   So let's get into this discussion.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.560]   Join me in welcoming Jonathan and Bill Bernstein.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.540]   (applause)
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.040]   >> Good morning, everybody.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.980]   When Christine emailed me about this session today,
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.780]   she said, "Well, what we'd like is for Bill Bernstein
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.240]   "to spend 50 minutes asking you questions."
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.420]   And my immediate reaction was,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.460]   "That is completely inappropriate.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.420]   "There's no way that I should be the one
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.360]   "receiving the questions from Bill.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.400]   "You know, I consider Bill to be easily my peer,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.860]   "if not-- and certainly my intellectual superior."
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.500]   So I said, "We should be asking each other questions."
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.760]   I've known Bill since the late 1990s,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.000]   when I was at the Journal.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.540]   He was one of those people who would send me
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.280]   these emails with ideas.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.180]   But unlike most of the emails I got with article ideas,
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.280]   his actually made sense.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.680]   And after about the 10th email, I was like,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.720]   "Okay, there's this neurologist in North Bend, Oregon,
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.360]   "and I'm gonna quote him in my column."
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.700]   And that has become the start of a great friendship.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.600]   You know, we've now known each other for a quarter century.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.560]   Bill has written forwards to two of my books.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.000]   I've written forwards to two of Bill's books.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.540]   He really has become a wonderful friend.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.280]   I've also got to know Jane over the years,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.180]   Bill's wonderful wife.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.020]   So it's really a great pleasure to be up here
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.780]   and talking to Bill.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.320]   >> Yeah, I could easily return the compliment,
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.060]   but with respect to the compliment
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.060]   coming in my direction,
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.800]   you obviously have not talked to my children.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.600]   Yeah, and again, the format here
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.400]   is we're gonna be tossing questions at each other.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.700]   You know, Jonathan has a wealth of knowledge
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.640]   and experience in the industry.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.000]   You know, you saw that yesterday
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.840]   with his conversation with Charlie Ellis.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.580]   Initially, I was tapped to do that,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   and I said, "No."
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   I said, "Jonathan knows more about the investment business
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.440]   "and about Charlie Ellis than I ever would,"
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.180]   and you could see what an excellent job
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.020]   he did with that yesterday.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.980]   >> So without further ado,
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.060]   my first question for Bill.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.960]   So you're well-known as an advocate for value investing,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.760]   and yet it's been a little bit of a thin 12 years.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.960]   So are you still a believer in the value effect?
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.700]   Do you think that maybe it's a behavioral phenomenon
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.480]   that's been priced out, or will value stocks come back?
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.780]   >> Yeah, well, let me first say
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.620]   that I can't be right about everything.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.860]   And with respect to how well value has done,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.720]   I do want to point out that value has done very well abroad,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.200]   both in developed markets and in emerging markets.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.600]   If you invested in the value components
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.300]   of the Total International with DFA,
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.340]   if you had access to that, or with Invesco,
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.880]   or even Vanguard had a relatively weak T version
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.920]   of international value, you're a pretty happy camper.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.080]   You're better off with value exposure abroad.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.360]   Now, why is that?
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.160]   Well, it's because it's a risk premium,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.060]   and the risk shows up.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.100]   And the lower your sample size, the higher that risk is.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.900]   So when you're dealing with the US,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.260]   you've only got one country, okay?
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260]   Whereas internationally, you are spreading your bets
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.700]   among the individual value effects of multiple countries,
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.180]   and that is a much higher probability bet.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.220]   So that's the first thing.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.320]   Has it been priced out?
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.380]   I do worry about that, because 25 years ago,
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.180]   you really only had one choice
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.380]   when you wanted the value exposure, of course,
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.060]   and that was dimensional fund advisors.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.560]   And now, everybody and their dog has small value
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.300]   and large value funds, and they're easier.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.360]   So has that been arbitraged away?
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.140]   Well, if that were the case, you would see the spreads
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.980]   between the balance sheet metrics
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.420]   between value and growth stocks narrowing
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.380]   as people bought up growth stocks, value stocks,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.020]   and sold their growth stocks off.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.880]   In fact, that spread has increased
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   to historically high levels.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.660]   And as I basically talked about yesterday
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.860]   with respect to international versus US,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.700]   you can buy the US small value market now
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.000]   for about 10 or 12 times earnings.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.420]   You're paying twice that, okay,
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.900]   for the big names in the total stock market.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.960]   And so, you know, to catch up with that,
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.200]   basically the large growth stocks
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.440]   are going to have to grow their earnings twice as fast
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.220]   over the next 10 or 20 years as the small stocks will.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.880]   That's not a bet I wish to make.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.820]   Now, it is a bet, okay?
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.060]   I think that value stocks,
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.920]   and particularly small value stocks,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.680]   will outpace the market over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.820]   But like everything else in finance,
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.160]   that at best is a 55/45 bet.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.240]   >> So Bill, two quick follow-up questions on that.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.560]   First, you say it's a reward for extra risk.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.040]   What is the extra risk in owning value stocks?
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.280]   >> Well, we sure as heck saw that risk
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.280]   during the global financial crisis
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.840]   when large value and small value stocks
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.980]   had even larger losses.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.260]   And we also saw that during the Great Depression as well.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.260]   Why is that?
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.480]   Well, the answer is very simple.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.160]   As value stocks tend to be more heavily leveraged,
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:57.560]   they tend to have greater exposure to debt.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.100]   They're more highly leveraged, in other words.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.660]   And the other thing about a growth stock
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.300]   is that its cash flows are further off into the future.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.640]   And the lower that interest rates fall,
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.340]   the more valuable those become, all right?
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.180]   And that's what happens during a financial panic,
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.780]   is rates fall, or at least when safe assets, they fall.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.740]   So we saw that happen over, really,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.740]   the 10 years between 2010 and 2020,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:31.120]   and then unwound with a vengeance as rates rose in 2022.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.420]   >> And my follow-up question.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.300]   So let's say I am a total stock market investor.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.420]   I've got $100,000 in a total stock market index fund.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.500]   It's in a retirement account.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.800]   There's no tax consequences to changing.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.840]   And I want to add a value tilt to my portfolio.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.840]   How much of that $100,000 would it be prudent
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.380]   to move towards value?
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.240]   >> Oh, 20%, 25% at most, I would think.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.580]   Rick Ferry, yesterday, talked about a very nice paradigm,
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.660]   which is that beta is free, okay?
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.860]   You pay nothing, literally nothing, to buy VTI,
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.420]   to buy the total stock market, or VTSAX.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.860]   And so, if you're going to get value exposure,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.600]   you don't want to buy somebody else's product
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.440]   that has large and small.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   You want it concentrated.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.880]   You want to buy a small value fund,
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.200]   say, from Avantis for 25 basis points.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.920]   So a quarter of that, no cost for the total stock market.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.720]   Your overall stock exposure, at least in the US,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.080]   is only going to cost you 7 or 8 basis points.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.480]   And that's probably how you should do it,
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.020]   and that's the major strategic change I made
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.460]   between the two versions of my books.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.560]   I was a slice-and-dice, four-corner person,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.800]   large, small, small value, large value.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.500]   And now, I think you really only need two funds,
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.240]   total stock market and small value.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.740]   >> Is your name Paul Merriman?
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.700]   >> Uh... (laughing)
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.620]   Well, when I heard Paul and Rick going at it yesterday,
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.180]   I thought to myself, "I'm pretty much halfway
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.180]   "between the two of them."
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.280]   I agreed largely with both of them.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   All right, time for me to turn the tables.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:18.000]   Okay, you know, you've had this long and storied career,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.660]   despite the fact that, you know, you look so young.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.360]   You've had decades in the industry,
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.240]   and you started out with a conventional career
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.400]   in journalism, and now, you are off on your own private venture,
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.080]   the Humble Dollar website.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.320]   What have you learned from working
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.620]   with individual investors on the Humble Dollar site
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.580]   more closely than you did working
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.760]   at, say, the "Wall Street Journal"?
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.700]   >> So I started writing my column
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.620]   for the "Wall Street Journal" in 1994,
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.100]   at the absurdly young age of 31.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.540]   I mean, to imagine I actually knew anything about finance
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.240]   at that point is embarrassing,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.280]   but the journal didn't give me a column,
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.500]   and I made my name as a columnist
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.180]   of the journal in the 1990s
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.380]   by pounding on the theme relentlessly
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.980]   that people should index.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.980]   Well, guess what?
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.260]   You know, we won.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.860]   You know, you will not get any credit
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.400]   for banging the table and telling people
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.720]   to index at this point.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.700]   Certainly, you won't make that as a financial writer.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.840]   You know, we have won,
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.760]   and it's a credit to the bogleheads.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.940]   It's a credit to everybody who looked at the evidence
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.680]   and said, "It is a fool's errand to try to beat the market."
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   My readers today, in many cases,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.520]   the same people who read me during the 1990s,
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.080]   they grew up with me.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.480]   And so, in the 1990s, you know,
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.460]   we were a merry band of individuals
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.400]   who were devoted to indexing,
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.560]   and we're drinking the Kool-Aid together.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.500]   Now, here we are, you know, almost 30 years later,
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.300]   and, you know, we have a little bit more gray hair.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.140]   In fact, some of it's pretty much white.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.400]   And our interests have moved on.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.620]   So, today, in running Humble Dollar,
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.340]   you know, there's no need to fight over indexing.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.720]   That argument has been won.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.580]   Instead, the real interest for my readers today
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.780]   is retirement in all its facets,
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.960]   and it's not just, you know,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.700]   "Should I use the 4% withdrawal rate?"
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.760]   It's thinking about, you know, Medicare,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.700]   Medicare Advantage, Medigap plans,
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.760]   thinking about long-term care,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.340]   thinking about what we'll make for a fulfilling retirement.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.680]   Now, I've amassed all this money.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.780]   Now, it's my time to enjoy it.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.380]   How do I make sure I enjoy it?
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.880]   How do I go from being a saver to a spender?
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.680]   Those are the sort of issues that I think about today
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.720]   and that my readers are concerned about,
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.820]   which reverberate with them.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.680]   And the reason I have this set of readers,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.760]   it goes back to the 1990s and the journal
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.860]   and the people who followed me there,
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.220]   because they've continued to follow me
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.160]   through until this point.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.700]   >> Yeah, but the question that I have, Jonathan,
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.240]   is what have you learned from your readers
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.740]   and your participants and your, you know,
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.540]   the people who are writing for you also at Humble Dollar
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.940]   that you didn't learn at the Wall Street Journal?
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.400]   And if I can be a little catty,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.780]   do you find one group more congenial than the others?
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.820]   >> Well, again, Bill, I'll go back to what I said,
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.260]   which is my readers are older than they were in the 1990s,
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.060]   and one of the things that we all learn as we grow older
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.600]   is how flawed we are and how many mistakes we've made
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:56.600]   and how there aren't answers always be found in spreadsheets.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.180]   You know, not everything comes down to numbers.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.500]   There is a huge personal element to personal finance,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.440]   and I do believe that my readers today
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.920]   are perhaps less arrogant,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.380]   less sure of themselves than they were 30 years ago.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.120]   There is a reason the site is called Humble Dollar.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.860]   These folks are much more interested
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.760]   in the human side of money and how to take their money
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.900]   and build a meaningful life with it.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.540]   >> Okay, just so I can, you know...
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.040]   >> You're going to pound on me a couple more times on this one.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.380]   >> Yeah, just one more fast question about that point.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.880]   It seems to me that they're not the same population of people,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.140]   especially when I look at the comments section
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.380]   in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.620]   They seem to be, as a group, a good deal more self-confident
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.020]   than the people on your website.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.180]   >> I think that's true.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:54.700]   I moderate the comments pretty carefully on Humble Dollar,
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.800]   and if there's anybody who's out there, you know,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.900]   pounding some particular political point of view,
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.240]   you know, I either delete their comments
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.440]   or I screen them much more carefully.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.140]   I don't want the sort of political infighting
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.780]   that goes on on so many websites on Humble Dollar.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.580]   If there are any sort of vicious personal attacks,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.620]   I make sure that those comments head into the trash can
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.420]   and then every couple of days, I go and review them.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.900]   I mean, it's amazing what people will write.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:34.600]   I had a contributor who talked about her concerns
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.640]   and included concerns for her daughter,
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.380]   and somebody wanted to post a comment,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.640]   "Is your daughter a drug addict?"
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.540]   And I guess on a lot of websites,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.380]   that comment would be allowed to appear,
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.280]   and on Humble Dollar, it isn't.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.820]   And so one of the consequences
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:56.280]   of carefully moderating the comments is that the tone
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.120]   on Humble Dollar's comment section is remarkably civil,
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.520]   and I am bound and determined to keep it that way.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.260]   >> Yeah, and this is my opportunity
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.560]   to thank Sue Kennedy, Lady Geek, and her crew
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.420]   on the Vanguard Diehards Forum for doing exactly that same
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.620]   thing, it's remarkably civil, and it makes the forum exactly--
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.000]   oh, there you are, very good.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.360]   Thank you, too.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.100]   You know, it makes the forum exactly what it is.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.140]   >> All right, Bill, my turn.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:38.080]   So you've advocated that retirees keep perhaps 20 years
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.140]   of required portfolio withdrawals
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.580]   in a low-risk investment.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.440]   Isn't that an awful lot of money?
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.820]   >> Yeah, it's aspirational, and I've found myself having
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.160]   to backpedal a little bit, but not very much from that.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.320]   Maybe not 20 years of full living expenses,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.500]   but certainly enough money to keep you out from under a bridge
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.560]   or a soup kitchen for 20 years.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.340]   You should at least be able to keep your body
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.360]   and soul together.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.140]   But the plain fact of the matter is that the reason why the rich
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.720]   get richer is because they have a large pile of safe assets.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.740]   If you, in fact, do have 20 years of living expenses
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.180]   in perfectly safe assets, you are much more likely to buy
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.160]   at the bottom from the person who doesn't have that,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.600]   and that is how the rich get richer.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.460]   As I said yesterday, and I'll say again, you know,
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.080]   that's why Warren Buffett has 20% of his money in T-bills.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.980]   He doesn't care when the market crashes by 60%
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.520]   because he can still buy cheeseburgers.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.960]   >> So is that aspirational 20 years
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.160]   of portfolio withdrawals sitting in cash investments,
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.360]   is that so people can sleep at night
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.700]   and not panic during market declines,
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.500]   or is it a source of firepower
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.840]   so they can buy stocks when the market's down?
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.600]   >> It is both, all right?
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.960]   And that pile now owns considerably.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.300]   >> Bill, did I hear somebody shout "market timer"?
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.800]   >> I plead guilty, I plead guilty.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.820]   Just because you believe in the efficient market hypothesis
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.320]   and you believe that you can't time the market
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.920]   does not absolve you from the responsibility
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.720]   of estimating expected returns, all right?
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.520]   On the forum, there was a very hearty debate
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.180]   a couple of years back between people who thought
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.260]   that it was really a good idea to put 20% of your portfolio
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.560]   into long treasuries, all right?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.420]   On the theory that you would rebalance out of them
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.600]   at a profit when the market crashed.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.860]   And they ignored the fact that the real expected return,
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:57.080]   judged by TIPS, on a 30-year treasury was, in fact, negative.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.880]   And in fact, was as low as interest rates had been
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.220]   for 5,000 years of human history, all right?
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:08.660]   Maybe if that's market timing, then I plead guilty, all right?
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.500]   I think that you have to take those sorts of things
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   into consideration.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.760]   Now that TIPS are yielding, you know, 2.5%,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.740]   I want to own more of them than I did last year,
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.540]   and certainly more of them than I owned two years ago,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.740]   because their expected returns are simply higher.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.680]   All right, do you want to follow that up,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.580]   or can I turn it around?
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.020]   All right, so the question that I have for you is, you know,
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.560]   the thing that's been the hallmark of your journalistic
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.060]   and humble dollar career, and the thing that I think
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.100]   sets you apart from almost all other personal finance writers
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.260]   is how deftly you handle the subject of happiness.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.960]   And so you and I first conversed about this, you know,
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.860]   25 years ago.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.740]   We've been talking about this, the two of us, you know,
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.100]   really since we first got to know each other.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.140]   And I'm wondering how your feeling about that
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.420]   has evolved from two different perspectives.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.260]   Number one is your interactions with your readers.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.420]   And number two, and I don't want to get too personal,
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.360]   but your own personal experiences as well.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:26.000]   So when I think about happiness, there are really, in my mind,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.800]   three components of happiness, three things
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.400]   that will ensure that you have a happier financial life.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.540]   I mean, one is that you want this sense of connectedness.
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.980]   You want to have a robust collection of friends
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.340]   and family.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.880]   Second, you want to be able to spend your days on activities
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.680]   that give you a sense of purpose,
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.560]   that you find fulfilling, that you think are important,
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.760]   that you find challenging, that you think you're good at.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.960]   And third, you want a sense of financial security.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.240]   You want this feeling that whatever
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.840]   goes on in the world, that you are going to be all right.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.780]   But the biggest change, I think, in my thinking
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.740]   over the past 10 years is that even
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.000]   if you work at all these things, even if you've
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.680]   got a nice pile of cash, even if you have a robust network
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.680]   of friends and family, even if you devote your days to things
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.160]   that you're passionate about, there
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.760]   is a limit to how much you can move the needle.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.520]   So many of you may have seen sort of the happiness pie
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.760]   chart, where half of happiness is determined
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.360]   by your so-called happiness set point.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:44.700]   10% is determined by sort of conditions in your life.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.240]   And then 40% is what's called volitional,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.040]   that if you put your mind to it, you
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.160]   can make your life happier.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:59.520]   I think this really overstates the case for how much you can
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.500]   improve the happiness of your life.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.600]   And we all know this intuitively.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.540]   I mean, you think about the people you know.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.760]   There are some people you know, doesn't matter how much money
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.500]   they have, it doesn't matter how wonderful the party is,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.280]   they are going to be grumpy.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   It's just the way they are.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.080]   And then there are other people, life
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.180]   can throw all kinds of horrors at them,
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.660]   and somehow they come out smiling.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.420]   And indeed, this happiness pie chart,
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.320]   which has got so much publicity, people
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.260]   are starting to fire back at it and saying,
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.860]   this is really just a pie chart designed for the personal growth
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.700]   industry in order to say, hey, you
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.180]   can make a big change to your life
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.040]   by doing this, this, and this.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.680]   I think that probably the happiness set point,
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.020]   from what I've read, accounts for maybe 80%
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.720]   of your happiness.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.620]   And that in terms of what you can do,
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.520]   10% is going to be your life circumstances,
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.400]   and maybe 10% is volitional.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.920]   The fact that you do actually do things like shorten
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.800]   your commute, try to be grateful about the good things
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.360]   in your life, and so on.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.240]   So I think there's far less room to improve your happiness
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.480]   than we are led to believe.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.900]   So what was your second question?
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.820]   Well, no, actually, I was going to make a comment on that.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.520]   I largely agree with that.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.440]   It's your set point, whether you're just
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.320]   you're a glass half full or a glass half empty kind of guy
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.080]   or gal that does that.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.520]   But I think there is an environmental component
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.260]   to that set point that has to do with values.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.160]   I look around this room, and I see pretty happy people.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   I don't see a lot of grumpy people here.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.760]   And the reason that is because it's the bogel head ethic,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.700]   is most everybody in this room is perfectly
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.700]   happy to not fly business class.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.480]   They don't feel awful when they pass that
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.580]   by the people in business class.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.980]   And they don't think they're what they wear
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.540]   or what they drive or what kind of house they live in.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.520]   Happiness, one of the definitions of happiness
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.560]   that I like, I think I've described this
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.660]   to Scott Burns, who's a finance writer in Dallas, Texas,
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.320]   is that a happy person is one for whom more money won't make
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.060]   any difference with what they wear, what they drive,
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.860]   where they live, or who they sleep with.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.440]   All right?
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.800]   And I think that if you really want a prescription
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.480]   for misery, it's to collect art, OK?
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.240]   Because if you collect art, no matter how wonderful your art
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.840]   and your sculpture and paintings are,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.920]   there's always somebody who's got one nicer, something nicer.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.060]   Even if you're a multi-billionaire,
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.660]   there's always somebody who's got more paintings than you do.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.120]   And that will make you unhappy.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:58.000]   Just a quick digression.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.120]   I'll take issue with your art example.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.820]   Yes, if your sense of self-worth is
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.560]   going to hinge on the car you drive,
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.060]   and we all know that certain cars are more expensive
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.260]   than others, and so on and so on, yes.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.540]   I can see that totally.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.800]   I can see that with homes, totally.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.940]   But with art, everybody has different taste in art.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.400]   And you may have this great collection of modern art.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.020]   And I may think, my three-year-old grandson
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.260]   could have done that.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.720]   So I'm not sure art is as good an example
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.860]   as commonly available goods like homes and cars.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.360]   But to come back to your point, which I generally agree with,
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.420]   is I think that money is less good at buying happiness
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.740]   than it is at staving off unhappiness.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.640]   And in coming back to the three components of a happy life--
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.660]   friends and family, sense of purpose,
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.100]   sense of financial security--
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:03.440]   I believe that that third one is the one
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.100]   that gets the least respect.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:11.240]   Because there's nothing like knowing that you don't
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.820]   have to worry about money.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:18.120]   I mean, being financially stable is like dealing
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   with your health.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:25.200]   It's only when you're sick that you want to be healthy.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.400]   Similarly, it's only when you're broke
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.740]   that you want to be in good financial shape.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.860]   Once you're in good financial shape,
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.500]   you're at the point where you don't
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.040]   have to worry about money.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.840]   And that is a wonderful thing.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.220]   I never worry about money.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.840]   I have never wake up in the middle of the night
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.080]   worrying about money.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.680]   I worry about a lot of other things in the middle of the
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.240]   night, but money is not one of them.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.920]   And I think that's probably true for everybody in this room.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.360]   It is not, unfortunately, true for the vast majority
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.660]   of people in this country.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:05.260]   A lot of people spend a lot of time worrying about money,
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.300]   even as they head off to the shopping mall on Saturday
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.660]   and spend the money that could give them
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.840]   that sense of financial security.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.700]   If you want to know what will give you more happiness,
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.940]   $5,000 sitting in the bank or $5,000 spent at the shopping
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.240]   mall, you already have the answer.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.560]   OK.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.760]   So if I can turn one more question around to you,
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.060]   which is that you've also written
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:37.300]   about how experiences have a better payoff, a higher
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.940]   payoff in terms of well-being than do consumer purchases,
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.840]   direct material consumer purchases.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.340]   And I wonder, are there any other things
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.700]   that money buys that makes you happy,
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.540]   aside from being able to go to sleep at night
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.780]   and not worry about money?
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.080]   Well, first of all, in terms of the experiences
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.020]   versus possessions thing, I think
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.640]   we should be a little bit more nuanced about that.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.520]   I mean, first of all, as you get older,
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.120]   it's understandable that experiences
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.260]   start to be more valuable than possessions,
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.760]   because at this point, we have less time.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.620]   We have less time to enjoy the possessions that we purchase.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.040]   So it's not surprising that younger people
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.760]   tend to value possessions more than older people.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.200]   It isn't simply that they're young and stupid
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.340]   and haven't had a chance to learn.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:36.320]   It's also that they do indeed have more time
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.020]   to enjoy those possessions.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.440]   The second thing about the experience
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.680]   versus possession question is there
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.080]   are a lot of possessions that, in fact,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.560]   facilitate experiences.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.520]   I don't own a car, but I know that if I had a car,
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.240]   it would have the potential to facilitate experiences.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.960]   We could get in the car and drive into the country
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.400]   for the weekend.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:06.280]   We could more easily go on vacation, driving vacations.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.480]   So to the extent that you value a car for what
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.840]   it can do for you, as opposed to being a status symbol
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.680]   that you can show off to the neighbors,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   I think the possessions can indeed
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.980]   be useful towards experiences.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.060]   And we shouldn't be that dismissive of possessions.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.820]   We should just think about them in terms
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.600]   of what are they going to do to make our lives happier,
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.400]   rather than what are they going to do to impress the neighbors.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.440]   Let's see.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.140]   So beyond the experience versus possession question,
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.280]   what else should we do to boost our happiness?
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.880]   I mean, I think we're reaching the point
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.920]   of diminishing returns.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.280]   I think you've pretty much covered
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.520]   all the things you'd want to.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.420]   But if you can think of anything else, let me know.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.180]   I think the only other thing that I think is important--
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.260]   again, it actually becomes more pressing as one gets older--
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:05.040]   is that the thing that money can do for you is buy you time.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.660]   Obviously, you can never buy more time,
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.040]   but you can buy control over your time.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.080]   So to the extent that you can use your time to unload chores
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.920]   that you find distasteful, if you really
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.240]   hate cleaning the house, if you really hate cutting the lawn,
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.080]   whatever it is, if you can buy your way out of that problem
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.060]   so you can use that time to do things that you enjoy,
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.920]   I think that is a very valuable use of money.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.420]   Yeah, I mean, again, we've sort of skirted
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.140]   around the edges of something that's
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.700]   called self-determination theory.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.000]   Jonathan has hinted at it.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.840]   I've hinted at it.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.680]   Mike Piper talked a bit about it,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.440]   which is the three things that everyone
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.340]   needs to have to be happy are connectedness.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.220]   And the second thing is competence,
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.620]   which I think gets to a lot of the boglehead ethic.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.260]   Jim Dolley talked last night about do you really
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.320]   have to keep cheaping out at the supermarket
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.160]   if you've got a seven- or an eight-figure portfolio?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.800]   And I think you do, because I think
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.320]   that that gets to my sense of competence, OK?
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.540]   If I go to a supermarket and I pay $5
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.340]   for a brick of cottage cheese, I have morally
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.640]   failed as a human being, all right?
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.440]   It's just as if I were in the clinic with a patient
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.680]   and I did a bad job or in the woodshop
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.240]   and did a bad job there.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.540]   You want to exert competence.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.620]   But the third thing and the most important thing,
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.420]   it doesn't get talked about enough, is autonomy.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.760]   And that may be the most important thing
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.760]   that money buys.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.420]   It's the FU money, OK?
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.860]   That may be the most important money that we have.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.720]   So my turn to ask Bill a question.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.360]   You may have seen at various points over the weekend
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.560]   that Bill has got excited.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.880]   And it's normally at the mention of tips.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.000]   Tips is the one thing that apparently Bill
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.640]   is most excited about right now.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:00.800]   So Bill, tell us why you are so enthusiastic.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.980]   And for those of us out there who
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:08.380]   are not going to build a 30-year complicated tips ladder,
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.220]   what would you suggest that we do?
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:15.420]   I would-- first of all, that is the ideal way to do it.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.360]   It's a lot of work up front.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.560]   But once you've got that tips ladder set up
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.160]   and you're maturing, and you've told your kids and your spouse
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.960]   about it, if you become demented,
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.040]   that thing will just follow all the way through.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.440]   It's basically a fire and forget portfolio.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.640]   Now, the alternative to a tips portfolio
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.340]   is to buy a couple of funds, a short fund and a long fund.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.380]   And the problem is you're constantly rebalancing that.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.540]   The theory is this.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.280]   Let's say you've got a 30-year survival horizon
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.960]   that you want to fund, OK?
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.520]   You want the average maturity of that ladder or of the funds
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   that you're buying to be half that, OK?
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.500]   So you basically want an average maturity of 15 years,
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.840]   whether it's tips or whether it's nominal bonds,
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.340]   to defease a 30-year lifetime.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.040]   You want to basically split the middle.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.540]   So that's what you could do.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.140]   And it's a little bit less work up front just to buy two funds.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.120]   And there's a short--
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.780]   Vanguard has a good short-term tips fund.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.080]   Unfortunately, there's only one even half-decent long-term tips
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.720]   fund, and that's from Boo Hist, PIMCO, OK?
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.220]   And they charge 20 basis points.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.420]   Hopefully, that will change.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.760]   But why am I excited about tips?
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.400]   Because you can guarantee yourself, at maturity,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.340]   a 2.5% real return, all right?
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.140]   That is more than historically the real return of bonds.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.980]   Any time that I can get a historical-- guaranteed
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.580]   a historical, good historical rate of return,
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.620]   I'm going to do it.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.440]   And when you look around the world
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.820]   and you say, what can I get with stocks,
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.160]   2.5% is not far from the lower bound.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.060]   Yes, the US and a lot of other developed nations
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.760]   have had returns of 5% to 7%.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.460]   But there are any number of countries
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.200]   that, over the course of the 20th century,
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.800]   had real returns on stocks that were below that.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.740]   So I just find them wildly attractive.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.000]   Not necessarily, maybe, for a young accumulator
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.200]   who should be more aggressively invested in stocks.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.980]   But if you're an older person who
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.620]   is worried about your burn rate, then that
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.680]   is why I am very excited about this.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.960]   I mean, what I like telling people a couple of years ago
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.780]   is I would have given my right arm
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.760]   to be guaranteed a 0% real return on my portfolio
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   at that point, all right?
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.600]   And now I can get 2.5%.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.160]   I'm pretty happy about that.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.840]   So Bill, if someone's a retiree in their 60s, their 70s,
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.400]   they've got a mix of stocks and bonds,
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.500]   would you-- and they're comfortable
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.180]   with their portfolio, their mix of stocks and bonds--
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.420]   would you advise them to sell stocks at this point
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.820]   to buy TIPS?
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.820]   It depends upon their burn rate, OK?
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.220]   And that's the thing that gets really left out
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.260]   in the discussion of what should my portfolio look
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.260]   like in retirement.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.200]   If your burn rate is 1% or 2%, and I'll
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.020]   bet there are a whole lot of people out here
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.640]   that I'm looking at that have 1% or 2% burn rates,
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.260]   it doesn't matter what you're invested in.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   You're probably going to be fine.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.780]   You could even have 100% stocks if you can stomach the losses.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.380]   Because your global portfolio is now
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:31.140]   going to be yielding a 2.5% average dividend yield,
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.080]   2.5%, 3%, depending upon how much foreign you have.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.420]   And that alone will be enough to pay your expenses.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.400]   And as we know, except in the very, very worst of times,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.600]   that dividend stream really doesn't fall.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.000]   If your burn rate, though, looks like it's
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:51.040]   going to be 4%, 5%, 6%, and you have good space
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.640]   in the sheltered part of your portfolio, which is really
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.100]   where TIPS belong-- they belong in a traditional IRA,
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.840]   for the most part--
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.580]   then I think that TIPS need real consideration
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.720]   in your portfolio.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   And as I said yesterday, personally, I
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.040]   don't need TIPS in my portfolio.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.220]   I'm fine without TIPS.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.820]   But I really like sleeping at night.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.020]   Your turn.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:21.080]   OK, one last question, which is that--
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.840]   and this is sort of my bottom of the barrel question
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.920]   here before we turn to the--
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:32.380]   before at least I run out, which is that consumption smoothing
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.080]   is something that gets talked about a lot
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.480]   by financial economists.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.660]   In other words, in the most extreme version of it,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.800]   you want to be borrowing money when you're young
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.400]   so you can have the bigger house and the nicer car.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.500]   And then you'll pay back that debt when you're older.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.960]   So that's an extreme form of consumption smoothing.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.800]   Another form of consumption smoothing
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.600]   is borrowing money for educational expenses,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.840]   which if done prudently is a good idea.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.880]   Where do you fit on that spectrum?
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.940]   So obviously, some level of consumption smoothing
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.380]   is a smart idea.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:08.580]   In your late teens, early 20s, there's
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.760]   nothing wrong with borrowing money to go to college
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.220]   so that you can have higher lifetime earnings.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.220]   There's nothing wrong with having
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.800]   to take out that car loan so you have a vehicle to get to work.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.760]   There's nothing wrong with taking out a mortgage
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.860]   so you can buy a house.
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.900]   What you're doing there is consumption smoothing.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.780]   You're buying things that you can't currently
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.180]   afford in order to jumpstart your financial life.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.280]   But this notion that you want to have essentially
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.120]   the same income throughout your life
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.160]   does not speak to human psychology.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.360]   I am absolutely thrilled to be staying in a Marriott
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.260]   because you should see some of the places
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.860]   I stayed early in my adult life.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.240]   If I had been staying in Marriotts in my 20s,
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.140]   if this wasn't happening in the Four Seasons,
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.060]   I would be really disappointed.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.100]   You want that gradually rising standard of living.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.640]   If you're used to flying coach, on those few occasions
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.080]   when you can use your points to get upgraded to business class,
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.420]   it is a real treat.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.360]   I have eaten in some really dumpy restaurants
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.280]   over the years.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.460]   The fact that I can actually go out
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.620]   to the most expensive restaurants in Philadelphia
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:23.840]   and afford it and not worry about the size of the bill
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.000]   at the end of the meal, that is a wonderful thing.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.080]   A gradually rising standard of living
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.100]   is a huge source of happiness.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.680]   And if you want to feel sorry for anybody,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.240]   feel sorry for the children of super wealthy families
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.040]   who will never get that pleasure.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.460]   If you grew up with the silver spoon in your mouth,
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.760]   it's basically all downhill from there.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.920]   I couldn't have put it better.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.720]   My favorite line from the Succession TV series
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.600]   was from Tom Wamsgams, if I can get his name right,
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.540]   the Matthew McFadden character, who
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.940]   was just terrified at the prospect of losing
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.640]   a lot of his money and losing his job
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.320]   and having to eat at three-star Italian restaurants.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.200]   When I go to a three-star Italian restaurant,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.260]   I hug myself.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.300]   So I think what we'll do at this point--
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.780]   Yep, I've got the first question for you.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.840]   If there are any more, and Mel has a fistful more.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.440]   But we'll start with this one, and I'll take those from you.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.140]   So Bill.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.820]   OK, thank you.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.360]   Bill, you keep saying if you've won the game,
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.120]   stop playing, or stop playing with money that you really
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.300]   need, I think is the exact quote.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.220]   What does that portfolio look like,
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.300]   and what percentages in stocks?
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.200]   It really depends upon what your burn rate and, of course,
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.100]   your risk tolerance are, and, of course, your age as well.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.940]   How many years of living expenses do you have to fund?
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.220]   And if you've got the 1% or 2% burn rate, you've won the game,
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.340]   and you're probably fine.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.680]   And it really doesn't matter.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.520]   You can keep the same portfolio.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.380]   But if you are 55, 60 years old, and your burn rate
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.760]   looks like it's going to be 4% or 5%,
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.060]   that's the time when you have to seriously think
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.700]   about lowering your stock allocation
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.100]   so you don't wind up with a bad sequence of returns problem,
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:26.700]   which is what Wade talked a lot about yesterday.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.700]   So it really depends.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.700]   And, of course, if you're 70 or 75 years old,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.340]   that's less of a problem because you don't have as many years
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.620]   to fund.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.120]   In other words, what you have to do
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.620]   is do the sequence of returns test.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.560]   Ask yourself, if we get the same sequence of returns
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.360]   that we got starting, say, in 1966, how am I going to do?
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   And if the answer is you run out of money in 5 or 10 years,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.440]   you want to start bailing out of stocks.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.260]   All right, so we're into the weird part
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.300]   of the session, the point at which
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.280]   I ask a question to myself.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.640]   This is one of the questions that came in.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.380]   How do you overcome the sense of insecurity about money
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.140]   even when you're financially independent?
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.920]   And this is a question to Jonathan.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.620]   Do you have any thoughts on that, Bill?
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.820]   Go ahead.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.760]   So I think that even if you have amassed
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.920]   a decent amount of money--
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.720]   I know that people do still feel financially insecure--
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.500]   I think there are a couple of different ways
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.140]   to try and address that.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.160]   One is to bucket your portfolio so
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.540]   that you have a certain amount of money for the years ahead
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:40.380]   and then a larger pool for the years beyond that.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.380]   So you might say, OK, I want to make sure I'm absolutely
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.680]   certain that I know where money's
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.380]   going to come from for the next 5 years or 7 years or 10 years.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.960]   And you put that into a portfolio
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.980]   of relatively conservative investments,
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.660]   and you know that's how you're going
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.360]   to pay the bills over the next 10 years.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.100]   And then you look beyond that, and you invest that money
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.520]   more aggressively.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.460]   I think you can also address concerns
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.740]   by simplifying your portfolio.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.840]   The larger and more diverse the funds you own,
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.880]   the less reason you're going to have to fret over
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.540]   your investment performance.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:20.120]   I mean, my largest single stockholding or fundholding
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.380]   is the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.180]   Who knows on any given day what sort of chaos
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.560]   is going on within that portfolio?
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.220]   But when I look at the share price,
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.160]   it moves relatively sedately.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.460]   I don't see all of that sturm und drang that's
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.600]   under the surface.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.100]   And the final thing I would say is there's great comfort
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.600]   in just having a big pile of cash in the bank.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.640]   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.320]   has this financial well-being study,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:54.920]   and they have dozens of questions in that.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.680]   And what they found was that the leading correlate
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.960]   with people's sense of financial well-being
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.200]   was so-called liquidity, basically the amount of money
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.920]   they have sitting in the bank.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:10.740]   And if you have $5,000 or more sitting in the bank,
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.840]   your sense of financial well-being
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.040]   is something like 50% higher than people
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.800]   who only have $250.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.180]   And the more you have in the bank, the better it gets.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.720]   So if you have a sense of financial insecurity,
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.680]   even though you're reasonably well off,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.220]   just keep a lot of money in the bank.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:31.720]   Why not?
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.760]   You can probably afford to do it.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.360]   It's a good thing that Mel isn't here,
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.720]   because as soon as I started to talk about politics,
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.620]   he would start getting very nervous
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.260]   and giving me the fish eye.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.660]   But this feeds directly in through what
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.900]   we're looking at politically in the country today,
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.740]   the polarization we're seeing, which
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.040]   is that if you have $5,000 in the bank,
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.780]   you're going to be very secure.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.080]   Well, the problem is that half the people in this country
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.120]   can't fund a $400 car repair.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.820]   And that does not lead to--
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.120]   and their existence, financially,
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.560]   is very precarious.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.120]   And that sense of insecurity feeds directly
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.060]   through in the politics we're seeing in the country today.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:19.500]   So Bill, I think this is for both of us, but I'm going to--
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.540]   Well, wait, wait, wait.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.460]   I want to ask Truss the question back to you,
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.580]   though, which is I thought it was a very interesting point
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.540]   about the sense of personal security.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.220]   And the thing that I've observed is
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.940]   that people who were raised in abject poverty
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.860]   don't feel financially secure, no matter
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.920]   how much money they have.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.860]   If they had a hardscrabble childhood,
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.580]   they never feel financially secure.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.160]   And I know you had some experience with that,
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.160]   personally, as well.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.860]   You have an interesting family history,
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.960]   which you've written about in forming your own view of money.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.840]   So for those who don't know it, when
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:57.640]   my great-great-grandfather died in Liverpool, England,
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:03.380]   in 1889, according to newspaper accounts,
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:08.220]   he was one of the richest men in England.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.720]   It was a family fortune built, I hate to say it, on cigarettes.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.320]   There's a brand called Cope Cigarettes, which is now
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.220]   owned by Nippon Tobacco, I think.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.700]   And that family fortune was inherited
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.540]   by a single daughter.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.180]   And she-- if you've seen Brideshead Revisited,
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.740]   as my mother has said to me, said,
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.140]   I don't need to watch Brideshead Revisited, darling.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.220]   I lived Brideshead Revisited.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.080]   [laughter]
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.720]   So there was this great family fortune.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:52.320]   It passed down to my grandparents' generation.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.120]   At that point, there were five siblings.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.380]   And four of them blew the money, in short order,
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.680]   on wine, women, and song.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.160]   My grandfather inherited the money.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.660]   And he blew it in a more boring fashion.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.420]   He blew it on gentlemen farming.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.860]   The farms kept getting smaller and smaller.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:18.080]   He would trade down to places with less acreage
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.040]   so that he could free up some capital
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.780]   to sustain his lifestyle.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.480]   Eventually, the farms got too small,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.540]   at which point he retired.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:28.720]   That is what happened to the great family fortune.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.920]   And that is the story that I grew up hearing.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:38.200]   And as a consequence, I have always been extremely frugal.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.460]   And as true of my two brothers, it's
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.300]   true of my sisters, we were all greatly influenced
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.660]   by this great family story.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.400]   And that's why we're all extremely careful about money.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.980]   Bill, this is really the same question
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.940]   in another guise, actually.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.540]   If you never worry about money, why
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.720]   shouldn't you allocate 100% of your portfolio to stocks?
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.580]   Repeat the question.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.080]   I want to make sure I understand it.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.760]   If you don't worry about money, I guess you would--
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.760]   in other words, you have a very high risk tolerance.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.660]   Right, OK.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.560]   Why not allocate 100% of your portfolio to stocks?
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.160]   Ah, OK, so it's a hypothetical question.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   I didn't catch that at first, because I worry about money
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.240]   every single day of the week, because that's
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.480]   my family background as well.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.080]   My father and mother both lived through the Great Depression
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.820]   as not even young adults, middle-aged adults.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.380]   So that was what I was-- but if you are hypothetically
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.220]   a person who is perfectly risk-tolerant
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.720]   and can stand 100% stocks, sure, you
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:48.620]   should be 100% stocks as long as your burn rate is less than 2%,
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.860]   all right, or 3% even.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.200]   There's no reason why you can't be 100% stocks.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   I'll tell you who else can be 100% stocks,
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.940]   is the person who has enough Social Security and pension
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.180]   income to pay 100% of your living expenses.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.300]   Because guess what?
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.820]   Your portfolio ain't your money, OK?
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.780]   It belongs to your heirs and your charities,
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.080]   and God bless to Uncle Sam, to whom you owe a great deal,
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.760]   all right?
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.420]   There's another kind of person who should be 100% in stocks,
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.460]   and that's the person, as Merton and Bodie and Samuelson
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.260]   pointed out, who has an enormous amount of human capital
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.800]   relative to their investment capital,
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.160]   namely someone who is just at the beginning of their savings
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.200]   career.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.440]   That person should be 100% in stocks.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.000]   And in fact, a la Paul Merriman, that
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.880]   is the person for whom small value stocks are most
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.780]   appropriate.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.580]   Because even if small value stocks
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.340]   return a percent less, a full percent less,
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.720]   than the large market does, you will still
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:52.180]   do better dollar averaging into small value stocks
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.660]   because of the volatility, assuming
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.420]   you have the emotional wherewithal and the discipline
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.400]   to do that, which is no small thing.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.300]   So I think I've answered that one.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.740]   All right, so we have a nice, large stack of questions,
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.440]   and we are not going to get through them.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.740]   But I've got one here that I'm going to ask Bill,
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.600]   because I'm hoping I'll get an interesting answer from him.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.020]   So somebody here asked, what do you think of bucket lists?
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.940]   But I'm not going to ask Bill that question.
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.580]   Instead, this is my question for you, Bill.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:27.260]   What is on your bucket list?
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:27.960]   Oh, my god.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.020]   A National Book Award?
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:39.400]   I mean, to be perfectly honest, I have--
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.460]   and my wife's going to wince when I say this--
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:46.740]   but I have fulfilled just about every single material
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.940]   need that I've ever had.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.280]   We spent-- we would take eight-week, 10-week vacations
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   in the summer with our children abroad,
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.620]   because we could afford to do it.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.920]   I mean, do I want a bigger car?
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:06.420]   Do I want the Tesla, the $80,000 or the $100,000 test Tesla?
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.420]   Hell no, that's not a car.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.860]   That's an IQ test, you know?
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.700]   So my bucket list-- and what else is on my bucket list?
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.060]   I want to see my grandkids graduate college.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.440]   I want to see my great-grandkids.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.940]   It's not material.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.180]   All right, final question for you.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.500]   Is there one book, blog, video you
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.540]   would recommend to our financially
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.880]   ignorant millennial child?
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:37.960]   Oh, that's-- well, first of all, you
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.620]   have to understand that I devoutly
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.400]   believe that it's cheesy to recommend
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.720]   my own books to anybody.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.620]   It just drives me--
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.140]   self-promoting authors drive me up a wall.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:51.460]   But almost anything by Jack Bogle or Rick Ferry or Larry
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.540]   Swedrow or Mike Piper.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.680]   And my favorite Jack Bogle book, of course,
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.900]   is The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.940]   So I would do the plug for you.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:06.340]   Bill has the booklet from how many years ago, if you can?
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:09.060]   Yeah, about 12 years ago, yeah.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.180]   What is the exorbitant price on Amazon these days?
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.260]   Well, it's zero if you'd want to download the Acrobat
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.920]   from any number of websites.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.660]   It's $0.99 if you really want it on your Kindle.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:22.940]   But it's totally unnecessary.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.840]   You can actually download the PDF,
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.300]   and then you can email it to your Kindle,
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.800]   and then you have it on your Kindle.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.540]   So don't spend the $0.99.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.900]   [laughter]
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.680]   Thank you, Bill.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.740]   And on that very suitable Boglehead moment,
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.040]   we'll wrap it up.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.480]   Thank you.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.620]   A round of applause for these two great contributors
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.420]   to personal finance.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.460]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.520]   you
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
