[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   >> Hi. Let's go ahead and get started. I am Christine Ben. Some of you know me from my
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.320]   work at Morningstar. Welcome to this Boglehead speaker series event. I am on the board of
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.920]   the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy. The Bogle Center, as many of you know, is
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.080]   a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It was created in 2012 by the founders of the Bogleheads
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.880]   organization with the assistance of Jack Bogle. The center's mission is to expand Jack Bogle's
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.320]   legacy by promoting the principles of successful investing and financial well-being through
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.800]   education and community and events like this one. The website is boglecenter.net. And your
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.200]   tax-deductible contribution to this cause is greatly appreciated. It helps us put on
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.320]   educational events like this one. We hope that you'll enjoy today's presentation and
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.760]   tell other people about it if you think that they might find events like this one useful.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.400]   Today's event is being recorded and you'll be able to find the recording and share it
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.640]   with others if you see fit. The video will be available at boglecenter.net and a post
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.860]   will be made to bogleheads.org when that is available for viewing. We'll also be tackling
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.780]   your questions during this event, probably after I cycle through some of my own questions.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.120]   So if you have a question you would like to submit to Karabeth, please submit it using
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   the chat function. For today's session, I am so excited to introduce you to Karabeth
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   Vance. She's here with me. She is a senior advisor at Timothy Financial Council, which
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.360]   is in the Chicago suburbs. Karabeth is a certified financial planner at CFP and she provides
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.240]   holistic financial planning advice to clients on an hourly basis, which I happen to think
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.440]   is a really good fit for a lot of Bogleheads in terms of a business model because I know
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.400]   that many of you are very competent and comfortable in terms of managing your portfolios, but
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.200]   you might have other aspects of your plan that you would like assistance with. And I
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.280]   think that the hourly model can be a really great fit in those situations. Karabeth currently
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.820]   serves as the primary advisor for over 125 clients. She partners with the firm's other
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.320]   advisors to collaborate on their clients and she leads the firm's investment committee.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.560]   Karabeth holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Wheaton College in Illinois and she's
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.200]   a NAPFA registered financial advisor. So we'll get into our discussion. I thought it might
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.280]   be useful to start with a few general questions, but otherwise Karabeth and I have organized
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.960]   this session by life stage. So we've got topics to cover for people just getting going with
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   their financial plans, as well as for those of you who are further along in your investment
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.680]   careers and potentially thinking about retirement or already in retirement. So we're really
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.760]   going to hit the whole life cycle during this conversation, but I just want to start with
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.600]   a few really general questions. Karabeth, you're an hourly fee only advisor. Maybe you
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.740]   can talk about why Timothy uses that business model and what sorts of clients, what sorts
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.800]   of investors you think it's a good fit for? Yeah, that's a great question. And thank you
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.400]   so much for having me today as well. So Timothy got started by our founder Mark Berg about
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.760]   20 years ago. And when he started the firm, it was because he was working in a different
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.080]   fee only model, asset center management, which is the most prevalent even today, and saw
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.160]   that there were people out there who weren't working with that type of advisory firm with
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.240]   an AUM firm who really could benefit still from financial planning advice and who were
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.320]   interested even in receiving that. And so he saw that as both an opportunity and just
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.200]   a large group of people who weren't able to be served or in that kind of prevalent business
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.800]   model. And so he started Timothy Financial as an hourly financial planning firm 20 years
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.680]   ago. We've always been an hourly only financial planning firm. And some of the sorts of people
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.240]   that maybe fit into that group, especially even when he was envisioning it back then,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.980]   there may be people who actually have a fair degree of wealth, but it's tied up in an illiquid
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.560]   asset like a business. Those people can't work that easily with an asset center management
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.160]   model because there are no liquid assets or very few to be managed and for advisors to
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.560]   get paid that way. Similarly, I mean, I'm here in Illinois and there's a number of people
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.820]   who have quite a bit of their wealth tied up in either state or federal pensions. Again,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.440]   maybe there's quite a few financial planning related questions, even big decisions around
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.040]   those assets. But those are not people who are going to be able to be served well under
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.380]   that model. Younger people, and I say younger, but not even necessarily right out of college
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.320]   or something, but maybe people in their 30s and 40s, really in kind of peak accumulation
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.000]   years, they may have a large amount of assets already, but maybe not quite hitting minimums
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   for some of those other advisory firms, or it's all in a retirement plan that really
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.840]   can't be managed by such a firm. So there's all these different groups of people who have
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.320]   unique questions and certainly would be served by having an objective advisor come alongside
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.560]   of them, but they're not able to get advice in that manner. And then there's just a whole
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.760]   group of people out there who, and maybe this group today fits into this, who aren't that
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.860]   interested in paying for the asset management. Maybe they have real life financial planning
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.680]   questions, both in, and we'll get into this with the different life stages, but thinking
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.120]   about kind of optimizing the different opportunities that are available to them at different stages
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.680]   of life. There's tax planning related questions. There's the question of, am I on track to
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.000]   retire at some future point? How do I balance these priorities of saving for retirement
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.240]   and education? But they just have no interest, or they're already really comfortable managing
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.440]   their own assets. Maybe they're already committed to a low cost, long-term, relatively passive
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   investment strategy, and don't want an advisor to place those trades for them, or they want
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.600]   to have direct access, not have to call someone to make that happen if they need money or
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.440]   want to put money in or anything like that. So there's a lot of people who benefit from
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:15.320]   objective, fiduciary financial advice, and they can get that in an hourly sort of a model
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.760]   like ours, but it's a little bit harder to get some of that advice for the examples that
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.600]   I mentioned in what was the more traditional pattern for fee-only advice. Most of our clients
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.760]   are, you know, most clients who are interested in the hourly-only model, they may fit into
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.680]   one of those categories, but a lot of times they're thinking on kind of in three areas
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.120]   of what they're looking for. They may be looking for validation, you know, am I, those questions
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.400]   of the am I on the right track? Am I, is everything that I'm doing, is it the right stuff? Should
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.200]   I have thought about anything else? And then ideation, which are there opportunities that
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.760]   they haven't thought of? You know, some of these little strategic planning tactics, and
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:08.400]   I say little, they could be little, they could be big, or tax planning tactics. And then
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.360]   having a trusted thought partner. So there's a lot of information out there in the world,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.680]   and you know, maybe even some of the questions that will come up today, we can all read so
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.480]   much information out there, and having a place to go to either, you know, to see is that
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.080]   an actually good idea, the thing that I read about on the internet? Or things are changing
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:39.160]   in my life, which, by the way, happens in everyone's lives, even when they seem relatively
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   stable. So how does that change, you know, what my game plan is? Or things that are beyond
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.800]   my control completely, like tax laws that change periodically here and there? How do
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:59.280]   I vet through, you know, what changes I need to make to my game plan? And then I think
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.540]   too, just, yeah, I don't know, even when you're looking forward, it, there's a lot of other
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.800]   things to consider with estate planning, what are your goals? Are you trying to leave money
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.240]   to charity or to kids? And having someone come alongside you who is an objective third
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.840]   party is really helpful as you think through those different questions that you may have.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:29.180]   That's, that's a great summary. And for people who are interested in hearing more about sort
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.760]   of how Timothy works, I was interested in a podcast episode that Michael Kitsis did
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.880]   with Mark Berg, for people who want to hear from Mark and sort of his thesis for starting
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.840]   Timothy and kind of what their clients are like, I thought that was really helpful, kind
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.680]   of a helpful compliment to what you've just talked about, Karabeth. You talked about the
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.000]   retirement readiness as being a real sort of pivotal life stage where even people who
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.120]   have been very comfortable do-it-yourself investors might want another eyes on another
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.480]   set of eyes on their plans. So can you talk about if I were to see someone at your firm
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.880]   for that type of sort of checkup on whether I'm ready to retire, can you estimate how
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.640]   long that takes and also provide, and I'm sure it's difficult, but provide kind of a
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.880]   ballpark estimate about what the all-in costs for such a project might, might run me as
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:34.040]   a client? Yes and no. I'll give you kind of an idea in just a moment, but the way that
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:40.240]   we kind of think about new clients coming in to our firm is we do categorize them by
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:47.480]   how complex their situations are, and that is not necessarily tied to life stage. So
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.200]   that can, I mean, it does come into play, that's part of it, but there are people that
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.440]   are pre-retirees or who are really kind of wanting to do a deeper dive into am I ready
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.480]   to retire, whose situation is a lot less complex and the amount of time that it's going to
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.200]   take us to go through that, validate, analyze it, and then there are others that are far
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.840]   on the other side of the spectrum. But just to give you a very general idea, you can certainly
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.720]   on our website go and look at our complexity levels under our fees page, very straightforward,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.440]   our current hourly rate is $300 an hour for levels, for most levels 1 through 4 clients,
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.260]   and I'm just going to use level 3 complexity to kind of address that because a lot of people
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.320]   do fall into that category, especially a lot of dual income households or a single income
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:47.960]   household with any complexity in terms of pension plans or unique types of employer,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:56.240]   unique type of compensation from their employer. So level 3 can range from 15 to 30 hours,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.840]   and for most people that are again kind of working on preparing for retirement, we're
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.120]   getting close to that, it's probably going to be more in that 20 to 30 hour range if
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:11.120]   they are in that level 3 complexity. And so that's going to range from $6,000 to $9,000
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:17.200]   to go through that initial financial planning engagement, that initial financial planning
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:23.880]   process. And when we do work with clients, that ends up being, we do actually quote for
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.240]   most of our engagements at the beginning, so that's a known cost with that larger investment.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.640]   But the majority of our clients do work with us on an ongoing basis. And when we are working,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.200]   when I'm working with a client, we'll say three years down the line, it's not going
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.080]   to take us another 30 hours to continue to be working with them in that year. It's usually
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.440]   more in the ballpark of a fourth to a third of the initial plan cost when we do that.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.640]   And we just, we fill our clients at actual time. So it's that number, I don't know
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:01.320]   whether if anyone has any experience on here with hourly financial planning, but it's a
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.480]   bit different than walking in and, you know, thinking you are going to sit down with someone
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.280]   and have kind of an informal conversation for one or two hours. And somehow we would
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.880]   be able to give you great confidence that you could retire at that point. We need to
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:24.000]   really understand your financial situation today and looking into the future to stress
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.800]   test that and understand your tax situation today. And as much as we can know into the
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:35.440]   future to be able to say with great confidence, you know, what the trade-offs are with those
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.540]   decisions, including retirement.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:45.960]   Yeah, that's helpful. One thing I have thought about is for people who are older retirees,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:52.740]   it seems like maybe one of the best uses of an advisor who charges you a percentage of
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.360]   your assets under management would be to have kind of that ongoing oversight. Like if I
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.800]   completely dropped the ball for some reason, is there a set of eyes on my investments in
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.460]   my plan? So do you think that the hourly works, hourly model works for people who need that
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.300]   sort of thing, or would they be better served by some sort of AUM arrangement, assets under
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.040]   management arrangement? And, you know, you can find kind of robo advisors, I guess, to
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.080]   do that for you. But how do you think about that issue?
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:30.600]   Yeah, we, I mean, we are serving clients who are older and who would like more support,
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.960]   maybe than the average do-it-yourselfer. Or maybe they were, you know, maybe they really
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:40.840]   were a true do-it-yourselfer earlier on in their lives, but are looking for more support
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:47.520]   now. And one of the things that we do is we actually do have a way to support our clients
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:54.760]   with what we call investment implementation. So sitting down, either in the old days, having
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:00.520]   them sometimes come into our office, or certainly sitting with them virtually to coach them
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.800]   through things like rebalancing trades. And when they're in retirement, most of, you know,
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:12.160]   most of the things related to the portfolio management are either rebalancing type of
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:18.680]   opportunities, tax loss harvesting opportunities, potentially, or raising cash if needed for
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.160]   withdrawals and retirement for living expenses. And we may also be working with them on, again,
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.440]   other things like where you're gifting from and to kids or to charity and stuff like that.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:36.280]   But they have the opportunity to receive a lot of support from our firm in that area.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.800]   And so we have clients doing that. There are also times when our clients have brought in
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.600]   another for them, another trusted person, family member. It might be their power of
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:54.400]   attorney to kind of be a part of that process with them. And that's a fine choice for them
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.160]   to make as well. But they're just the question of do I think a client like that can be served
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.240]   in this way? I think the answer is yes, with support. Because they're still not, they don't
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.360]   have to go and execute everything without any assistance. But there may be times when,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.320]   you know, we didn't really bring this up necessarily, but there may be times when another route
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:24.280]   needs to be looked into if, you know, if a person thinks or it becomes clear that mental
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.800]   faculties are failing and there's not a, you know, there's not a power of attorney or co-trustee
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.160]   or something in place to be working with them on that.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.960]   >> That's great. I want to talk, before we get into this life stage discussion, the market
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.920]   has had really strong gains over the past few years. What kinds of issues are you seeing
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.080]   in client portfolios? And specifically, I'm curious, are people reticent to de-risk even
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:57.040]   if you're telling them that that might be appropriate given their life stage? What sorts
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.800]   of portfolio issues are you seeing and contending with with your clients these days?
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.720]   >> It's a great question. And I'd say on the whole with our clients, especially those who
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:13.280]   have been around with us for a long time and are on the same page in terms of investment
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:21.600]   philosophy, they are not necessarily that resistant to that idea of rebalancing, which
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.240]   when stocks are up, we're looking at selling stocks and potentially buying bonds or using
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.640]   those stock winnings to fund living expenses in retirement, things like that. They're committed
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:39.640]   to that idea of rebalancing. I think when those clients or individuals who have had
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.960]   a little bit, have given a little more pushback on the conversation, are maybe those who are
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:52.440]   still, for various reasons, holding on to a handful of individual stocks, which right
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:18:01.400]   now may be in the tech sector. They've seen a lot of growth in the individual securities
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   that in some cases is outpacing the index returns. And so if they see an index in their
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.920]   portfolio and an individual stock in their portfolio that's outperforming, that is a
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:19.160]   little bit harder, or that I have seen that be harder for clients to make the choice to
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:25.040]   sell when stocks are so far up like that. But the conversation always is still about
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:31.360]   risk. I don't know, we can look out there and say valuations are higher, the stock market
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:40.000]   is high and we expect that at some point we will see a market drop. And if we all knew
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.480]   exactly when those things were going to happen, and we could make them perfect timing decisions,
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.800]   then we could make a little more money doing that. But we don't know. And individual investors
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:59.760]   and investment professionals have not been able to historically make those perfect timing
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:08.240]   decisions. And so that kind of trying to do that has usually led people to have lower
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:15.320]   returns than the long term kind of market returns that they can get in a more passive
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.560]   portfolio. So these are conversations that I'm having. I think one of the areas where
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.920]   this can be, where people get especially concentrated is in the area of employer stock, if they're
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.680]   being issued that. And this is one reason, not because I know whether that employer stock
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.040]   is going to appreciate faster or slower than the broader market index. But this is one
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.480]   of the reasons why when there are opportunities in a relatively tax efficient manner to be
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.400]   exiting out of individual stocks, even those employer, you know, employer stock programs
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:20:00.240]   that are out there. That is often something I am encouraging clients to do, because of
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:06.160]   the psychological difficulties, both on the upside and the downside. To shift out of them,
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.240]   you may have a really outside stock position that is up so much. And now there's a huge
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:17.800]   or what feels like at least a huge tax burden, if you go and sell that. But you want the
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.920]   stock to go up, you don't want to lose money. And the best time tax wise to sell is when
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:32.520]   it's down. So you have kind of competing desires for that stock. And it's just there, that's
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   a lot of stress that people are choosing to retain, I think. And on the flip side, of
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.120]   course, when it's down, then you're having to make this decision of it, maybe the whole
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.400]   market is down, you know, maybe we're looking last March and, you know, February, March
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.480]   and individual stock position or employer stock position is down, so is the broader
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.280]   market. But holding on to your individual stock is still kind of a decision to say,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.680]   well, that's going to recover faster than the rest of the market. And how do you make
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:11.520]   that decision? So anything that I can help clients to do to kind of limit that level
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:18.200]   of stress in their lives, regarding these individual stock decisions, I try to be an
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.080]   encouragement to do that along the way. And that really helps because clients again, who
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:29.520]   are committed to kind of the broadly diversified portfolio and committed to this idea of rebalancing,
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.400]   they see this and you know, whether the market's up or down and see either potentially it's
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.360]   an opportunity or it is we are, it makes sense to take some risk off the table at this point,
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.840]   because we don't know when that downside is going to come. And we want to make sure that
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:49.280]   the portfolio is appropriate, especially for those who are on the cusp of retirement or
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.560]   in retirement, we want to make sure that it is still the right mix of assets so that they
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   know where living expenses will come from if they need to come from the portfolio in
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.160]   any particular year.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:05.640]   Right. I want to talk a little bit about some of the key life stages, people just starting
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:12.200]   out. Even if our audience might not be composed largely of those people, chances are we've
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.960]   all got people in our lives who we want to try to help make smart decisions. So what
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:23.920]   are some of the key financial challenges that people who are just embarking on their careers
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.160]   in their say, 20s and 30s run into financially? Can you talk about some of those things that
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.800]   you confront with your practice?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:39.600]   Sure. I mean, one of the easiest things I think about is employer benefits and navigating
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.400]   what those are and what opportunities are available. You know, somebody just starting
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.640]   out may or may not be able to kind of maximize all of their potential savings opportunities,
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:56.880]   but even making decisions around benefits, should I be contributing to my 401k? I still
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.840]   have, I still have student loans over here. How do I think about that? And even just working
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:08.960]   with them through kind of some initial things about, let's make sure you have, or be working
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:15.800]   towards having some cash, you know, so you have a month or so float in checking and we
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.120]   work towards, you know, a real, a stronger, solid emergency fund. And maybe even along
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:27.560]   the way with that, we are also looking at, you know, at least contributing to the 401k
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.360]   to get our free money from our employer, those sorts of things and helping them, helping
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   them to balance this idea that there are a lot of things vying for their potentially
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:43.120]   more limited income, especially when they're first starting out. But how do they build
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:49.520]   good disciplines and habits, even in those early ages, that really do make an impact?
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.840]   Because we've all, you know, we've all seen the charts about the power of compounding.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:01.960]   And those are, that's a really wonderful decade to start systematically saving, even for retirement,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:09.120]   which is not on the minds of most 23 year olds. So that, you know, just thinking about
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:15.640]   being older people in younger people's lives, I think anything that we can do to encourage
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.200]   those, you know, those initial habits, which probably many of you are already doing in
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   the lives of younger people in, you know, in your lives, kind of letting them know to
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.320]   take a look at that, that it's worthwhile, even if it's not, you know, the most money
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.940]   ever, they could be contributing to start that sooner than later. And then something
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:40.680]   that I think is really beneficial, too, is thinking every year, you know, in those that
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:46.760]   first 10 years or so people's incomes tend to change fairly dramatically from, we'll
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:54.920]   say 23 to 33. And so as that's happening, again, how do we in a disciplined way, continue
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.000]   to build our savings rate? Because at the beginning, when we maybe are, some people
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.680]   are still paying off student loans, or there's just not as much money to go around that is
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.440]   not as many resources to manage, you know, maybe they're not getting up to probably they're
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.600]   not putting $19,500 in their 401k. But how do we work toward that, just so that as our
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.960]   incomes grow, and our lifestyle probably also is growing, that we are matching that with
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.080]   a commensurate increase in savings. And it is the least painful way to do that when your
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.640]   income is increasing. Because you're just capturing some of that growth by, you know,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   increasing those contributions to retirement. So I think that is really handy if they can
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.480]   get away with doing a high deductible health plan, which is what many of their employers
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.200]   are offering. Obviously, everyone's health situation is different. But if they start
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.880]   using that HSA, as an investment vehicle, I think that's a good opportunity for them
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:59.720]   to just because of the triple tax savings. So those are just some things to think about.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   I think the one other thing when people are just starting out, and especially if they're
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.800]   thinking about things, maybe they're planning to get married, or they're going to buy a
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   home. Maybe the wedding is easier, because that's more of a one time expense. But how
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.160]   do they if they need to save for that at all? What does that look like? When we're talking
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.840]   about that initial home purchase? You can go out there and have people tell you that
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:32.440]   you can afford a home that you probably ought not decide to buy. And so how to, you know,
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.320]   looking through that decision with people and just the trade offs that are associated
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.960]   with that. And especially, you know, I know, we're not in maybe to the married couples
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.600]   yet. But especially when I think about married couples who don't have kids yet, there is
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:53.400]   just it. When you have two incomes, and you feel like you have a lot of a lot of discretionary
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.960]   income, it can certainly feel like the right thing to get, again, maybe purchase a home
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:07.640]   that maybe fits in that income and expense ratio now, but doesn't give you a lot of flexibility
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:14.680]   for things to change. And there are so many things that change in those first couple of
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.040]   decades of adulthood and you know, being in the workforce. Again, both incomes increasing,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.960]   that's hopefully going to happen. But if people decide to have children, maybe one spouse
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.280]   decides to either stay home completely or work part time, or what are we doing for childcare,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.360]   that is a large expense that, you know, a 28 year old couple without kids probably hasn't
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.280]   really thought about yet. And they haven't needed to. But one of the best ways to retain
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:51.360]   flexibility to make changes in those decades is by kind of keeping your core living expenses,
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.800]   I'm going to say at a reasonable level, but help, I do help younger clients to think through
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.480]   that process so that they don't get, I'm going to say in over their heads or locking in really
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.800]   high living expenses that may not be sustainable.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.920]   Right, that's super helpful. And I know, I know that message will resonate with this
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.480]   audience. Because part of the Bogleheads philosophy, in addition to low cost investing is also
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.520]   just absolutely living within your means. So I think you're speaking to people who really
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.760]   believe in what you're saying. How about for people once children do arrive, a key fork
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:30.080]   in the road would be whether to fund college, and we know that the cost of college has gone
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.720]   through the roof, whether to start saving for college, or and or what to do about the
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.880]   retirement accounts and how to balance those two competing goals, the one that is coming
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:48.600]   up sooner, the college goal, alongside retirement, how do you help married people with kids or
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.480]   unmarried people with kids, navigate that decision?
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.400]   Sure, that's, that's a really good thing. I mean, that so many people are having to
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:05.760]   wrestle with those competing priorities. I think one thing is not necessarily, I think
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.480]   it is valuable for, I'm just going to speak to couples for a second, but you know, people
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.640]   to to think about college, if they desire to contribute to college, to try not to think
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:23.520]   about that as a blank check, because you can't plan, you know, who knows then what that number
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.320]   is that we're talking about, you may have a desire to fund, I'm just going to say 100%
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.480]   of college education, that that value differs certainly across the spectrum. But if you
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:42.200]   were trying to fund 100% of a child's college education, well, that number could range from,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:48.080]   you know, I don't know, with scholarships and things, $10,000 a year, up to 80 plus
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:55.840]   $1,000 a year. And those two numbers over the over a four year period, and when we talk
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.400]   about today's dollars, and then what that might be in the future, those are just vastly
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:07.040]   different pots of money to put towards that child's college education. So one thing I
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:14.120]   really encourage parents to, to do or to think about is not necessarily, so first of all,
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:20.840]   to think about what their goal actually is, and try to set a realistic dollar target,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   different people go about this in different ways. One way that I've seen is maybe maybe
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:31.560]   their goal is to fund three out of four years of the college education, and they pick a
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:38.800]   school that's kind of the target budget for for that child. And so, you know, and we we
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:45.560]   work through how that fits in with retirement savings as well. But coming up with what our
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:52.760]   initial goal actually is as a dollar amount, and then, you know, then then working through
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:31:00.280]   that, the details of, does that go into the 529 plan? Does that go somewhere else? I am
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:09.120]   hesitant to have clients overfund their children's 529 plans, especially just because usually
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.960]   when people are working on building those assets, the range of outcomes for the rest
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:22.360]   of their life and retirement are so wide, we don't have clarity on what that looks like
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:29.120]   yet. So I think 529 plans are a great idea. They're, you know, we get that tax free growth
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:35.800]   in there for for educational costs. In a lot of states, you get an estate income tax deduction.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:43.120]   So you might decide to do a small amount in there just for that purpose. But there are
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:49.680]   certainly circumstances where I have advised clients to either at some point, or splitting
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.200]   their savings along the way into both the 529. Of course, the retirement accounts will
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:02.000]   work on that as well. And then maybe after tax savings to have more flexibility around
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.320]   those dollars. And then just the other thing is about communicating with your children
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:17.440]   about it. Before you have clarity on what is possible, it is best not to tell your children
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.520]   that or I think it's a good idea to wait to tell your children until you have greater
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:29.680]   clarity around what is doable for you in your circumstances. And then once you do have some
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.720]   clarity around that, it's great to share with your children to give them that expectation,
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.640]   especially if that expectation may involve them contributing in some way to their college
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.960]   education. And that can be a really great way to bring them into the process. And again,
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:53.040]   maybe instilling some of these disciplines and values. I have seen teenagers and when
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:59.440]   they started working, setting aside funds for college as well, just as a practice to
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.920]   be a part of that. And it may be a smaller contribution than their parents. In many cases
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:11.280]   it is, but they have some skin in the game and know the value of what they're looking
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.400]   to make a decision on at age 18.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   Right. That's a great help. And I will also tell the audience that we have in June, our
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.400]   speaker series guest is going to be someone who, I'm not sure if it's public yet, so I
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.320]   won't say who it is, but it's someone who has a lot of expertise in this area, specifically
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.860]   paying for college. So stay tuned for more information about that. I know we're all interested
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:40.280]   in helping our young loved ones get off on the best foot and college is such a heavy
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   lift.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:47.920]   Karabeth, can we talk a little bit about sort of moving along the life cycle, peak accumulators,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.480]   people who are, you know, maybe in their early 50s or something like that, who are making
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.080]   the most money they've ever made in their careers, and perhaps they're maxing out their
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:04.400]   IRAs and their 401ks. I'd like to talk about what their next receptacles for funding should
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:10.360]   be, or at least what they should be thinking about if they are fully funding the kind of
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.760]   basics. Where should they go next if they still have additional funds to save?
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:22.720]   Yeah. Well, there's only so many options. That's the starting place. But I mean, typically,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.620]   and there's always going to be an exception to this, but typically, when I'm kind of ordering
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.760]   the accounts and the way that I'd want to approach them, I'm usually looking at my tax-free
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:40.080]   accounts first, especially ones like the HSA. If you are able, you know, if you are in a
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.700]   high-deductible health plan that is compatible with an HSA and you can be contributing and
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:50.160]   investing in that, because we get that tax deduction going in, and we get the growth
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:56.320]   is not taxed, you know, as it's growing, and the distributions are also not taxed as long
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.360]   as we use them for qualified medical expenses in retirement. So that is a wonderful retirement
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:11.600]   savings vehicle. So that one, I like people to use, looking at Roth IRAs or Roth contributions,
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:17.120]   and I will throw this in. I have a lot of people that come to me, and this group probably
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.840]   maybe isn't in this category, but I have a lot of people who don't realize that they
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.800]   can do either Roth 401(k) contributions if they're a high-income earner, that there is
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:36.920]   no income limit on choosing to do Roth 401(k) or Roth 403(b) contributions rather than pre-tax.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.880]   So that may be something that makes sense for even a peak accumulator who may be in
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:48.320]   a higher tax bracket. I'll talk about that in a second. Or they may not realize that
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.520]   they can do the backdoor or two-step Roth contributions by funding non-deductible IRAs
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:36:00.000]   and converting to Roth. Or they may say, "Well, I think I could do that, but I have a $500,000
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.680]   IRA somewhere, or even a $100,000 IRA, and so can I still do that?" And there are some
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:11.880]   steps that they could potentially take to start employing that strategy as well. So
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:20.840]   anytime we can get tax-free growth, I am pro doing that. Then pre-tax retirement accounts,
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.720]   for some people that's the only option, or it's an additional option. Maybe on top of
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:32.240]   a 401(k) or 403(b) they have access to another type of retirement plan, a lot of academic
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:38.600]   medicine, there's multiple pre-tax accounts that get built up over a long period of time.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:46.520]   And then the accounts to be looking at next are really an after-tax investment account.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:54.720]   So it's not bad. We get taxed because we make money on our investments, but there's no special
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.800]   tax advantages to that. We're going to be taxed on our investment income. We're going
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:04.240]   to be taxed on gains when we sell in our after-tax investment account. But a lot of high-income
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.720]   earners, really to hit the right kind of a balance between living expenses and savings
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:17.320]   to support the lifestyle that they are living now into retirement, it actually requires
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:23.520]   contributions to long-term investment accounts on top of what they're able to put into their
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:29.320]   regular retirement accounts through work, or even those PLUS IRAs or Roth IRAs. And
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.680]   then I'll go ahead and add here too, there is a feature that has been becoming more and
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.960]   more prevalent, and it is worthwhile to look at to see if you have, especially in that
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.920]   stage of life and really from that, once you have the cash flow to be saving more on into
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.800]   your pre-retirement years when you're getting a lot closer, would be after-tax contributions
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:57.560]   to your 401(k) at work. So that's something to take a look at your summary plan description
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:04.080]   or whoever you're talking to about this, see if that is an option, because this is a new
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:10.720]   concept to a lot of people. The idea is that if you actually have a provision in your retirement
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:16.360]   plan where you are able to make after-tax retirement plan contributions, you could still
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:24.840]   be making your, we'll go with someone over 50, your $26,000, those contributions in pre-tax
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:33.600]   or Roth to the plan, your employer can also be making a contribution to the plan. But
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:40.400]   if that, if those two contributions combined don't get you up to the maximum, that $64,500
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:47.200]   if you're over age 50, then you are actually, if you have an after-tax contribution provision,
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.640]   you can actually put in additional contributions. They may have other caps as a part of your
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.720]   plan description, but theoretically you may be able to put in the gap up to that maximum
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.680]   amount. So that is a place where you could put a lot more money. And when this becomes
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:14.640]   especially valuable to you is when your plan also has an in-plan Roth conversion feature
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:21.760]   where you are actually able to put these after-tax contributions into the 401(k) and then convert
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:28.440]   them to Roth so they can grow tax-free. If there is no Roth conversion feature as a part
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:33.220]   of that, if you can't convert your after-tax contributions, then what happens is if I put
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:42.120]   in $10,000 as an after-tax contribution this year, and then that $10,000 grows to $50,000
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:48.040]   by the time I retire, and I'm now rolling over my 401(k) at retirement, I haven't converted
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:54.040]   anything. I just made after-tax contributions of $10,000 that grew to $50,000. That $10,000
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:40:02.240]   in contribution, I will be able to roll into a Roth IRA. The $40,000 of growth, I will
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:09.320]   roll into my pre-tax IRA because I still need to be taxed on that. The growth on the after-tax
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:15.920]   contributions, the automatic way for that to work is that it is tax-deferred. If your
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:21.120]   organization has this in-plan Roth conversion feature, and you could convert your after-tax
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:27.560]   contributions immediately to Roth, so I put in that $10,000 this year and immediately
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:36.960]   convert it to the Roth bucket in my 401(k), and now that $10,000 grew to $50,000 at retirement,
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   I can roll the whole $50,000 into my Roth IRA. You start that tax-free growth sooner
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.920]   if you're able to make that conversion. Sorry, I went on a little bit about that.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:53.480]   That's super helpful, and I agree. There's a lot of confusion. People get that mixed
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:41:00.320]   up with a Roth 401(k) contribution. It's different, but you say you're seeing more of it in terms
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.600]   of your clients' plans or their 401(k) plans are including more of this feature?
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:12.460]   I am. I'm seeing it more and more. Even 10 years ago, to be honest, I'm not sure exactly
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:18.800]   when it came out, but I was not seeing this regularly 10 years ago. Today, people who
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:25.600]   work for larger companies or publicly-traded companies, I see it quite often. Some of those
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:31.560]   plans even have a feature where you can automatically have the after-tax contributions convert to
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:38.040]   Roth. Those who are designing those plans and administering them absolutely understand
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:44.960]   the strategies that the participants are seeking to employ by using them. That can be a really
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:54.800]   great bucket to use. In your 401(k), you still can't access the funds extremely easily if
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:03.040]   you need them for other stuff. All other things equal, I would rather see clients put contributions
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.840]   in the after-tax bucket in their 401(k), especially if they can convert it to Roth, than to take
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.800]   those same dollars and invest them in a brokerage account, just a normal after-tax brokerage
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.880]   account where they'll be taxed on dividends every year and capital gains eventually.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:27.080]   Right. Moving on, because I would like to touch on people who are getting ready to retire
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.960]   and retired. Starting out with the getting ready to retire conversation, I think we could
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:39.000]   do this whole session about this topic, but if I'm at that life stage, what are the key
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.480]   things that should be on someone's dashboard that are on your dashboard as you help clients
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.680]   figure out, are they ready to retire? What's retirement going to look like? Can you talk
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:55.760]   us through that? Sure. I think it's a good time to be taking stock of what are all the
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:02.200]   pieces that are out there. It is not uncommon for people who've been working and saving
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.720]   a long time to have a lot of different accounts in different places or be vaguely aware of
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:15.520]   old pensions that they may have had contributed into for them, but haven't really pulled all
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:22.040]   the pieces together. Just at a very basic level, it's what do you have that's out there?
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.840]   Truly, you may have thought that's a small account or that's not that important, but
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:32.940]   let's take stock of everything that is going to contribute to your retirement lifestyle.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.560]   All of the liquid assets that you have and everything that would make up your normal
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.200]   net worth statement, but especially going there and pulling in, well, what other, do
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:47.760]   I have any pensions that are out there? What are my social security benefits going to look
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.800]   like? Thinking about on the pension side, are those social security statements that
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:57.240]   I've been getting, do they actually reflect what I'm actually going to receive? Because
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   if you have been participating in employment that's not covered by social security, you
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.320]   may be still, maybe you were covered by social security in previous employment and so you
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:16.000]   still have a nice statement that's for social security showing $1,500 or something, but
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.040]   that's not actually what you're going to receive if you have a government pension that will
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:27.360]   reduce that either through the windfall elimination provision or the government pension offset.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:33.000]   Those are things to take stock of or to be aware of. Also, how are you going to get health
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.960]   insurance? Even if you're over age 65 when you retire, do you have any kind of a retiree
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:45.280]   medical benefit? Some companies still have those, especially if you have had any kind
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.340]   of company pension, you may be eligible for something like that. I have also seen other
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:56.160]   companies out there who have some kind of a stipend for retirees that just helps to
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:05.600]   kind of offset some of those costs for medical insurance in retirement or at least pre-65.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.040]   Are there any kind of retiree related benefits that you are eligible for and that you would
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:17.280]   be tapping into? Then if you are going to be retiring before Medicare age, what are
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.680]   we going to do? Well, again, what are we going to do for health insurance? Will we go onto
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:29.520]   the exchange? What is the gap? Maybe you end up on COBRA and that bridges the gap between
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:37.140]   employment and 65 if you're already in your 60s a little ways. So getting an idea of what
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:44.140]   are those different pieces is going to be really valuable to you. The biggest driver
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:52.280]   in kind of what is the impact on long-term planning are your living expenses. And I will
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:57.060]   also throw out there, there certainly are people who track their living expenses and
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:02.180]   that's either enjoyable to them or just a fun quirk that maybe their spouse doesn't
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:07.920]   always appreciate. But some people are tracking their living expenses. I would say the majority
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:14.400]   of people are not in any detailed way tracking their living expenses. But you've always,
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.820]   again, lived within your means, been intentional maybe with your saving and then with your
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:27.760]   spending. But now we're getting to a stage where you may be drawing down your assets.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.040]   Maybe you're in a position where you don't have to do that, but most people are going
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:37.720]   to be drawing from their assets in some way. And so how do we work through a few years
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.960]   of expenses or just trying to get a really good idea of what those are and how we're
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:50.400]   expecting them to change? I don't make my clients try to predict the future. I don't
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:57.280]   predict the future either really, but I think there's some key things. Just as an example,
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:02.040]   I mean, sometimes people are coming to me and they're expecting to retire and they're
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:07.700]   planning to move. Their game plan is they are going to buy a house in Florida or somewhere
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:15.440]   else in a more Southern state and their living expenses will likely change substantially.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:21.200]   And we need to think through what the implications are of that. And for many people that, well,
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:27.720]   I'll say this, on the housing side, for many people that may be decreased housing expenses,
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:32.440]   for a lot of people, one of the things they want to do in retirement is travel or they
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:38.740]   have a hobby that they really want to spend a lot more time investing in. So we need to
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:44.620]   think through those things to account for, especially maybe in the earlier years of retirement,
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.740]   maybe some housing expenses decreased if you did decide to downsize. But on the other hand,
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.620]   we have some other activities that you're going to bring into your life that may have
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.980]   a cost associated with them. So getting a good handle on those living expenses starting
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:04.340]   out is a good starting place too in those couple of years before retirement. And when
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.420]   I'm working with clients who are making that transition, I do let them know we will get
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:16.620]   a better idea. Once you start actually drawing from your assets and you're making a game
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:22.740]   plan for that every year, but then looking a number of years out, it becomes very clear
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:29.180]   what you spend if you kind of set up a system to be drawing on your assets and then you
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:34.560]   encounter some surprises. So we will get that nailed down in the first couple of years of
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.360]   retirement. But everyone, even if you're not working with an advisor, that is something
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.940]   to work through in those years.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:46.300]   That's a great help. My last question, I think it'll be the last question. I want to talk
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:52.020]   about for people who are already retired. I want to talk about an issue that I've run
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.660]   into a few times and I'm curious to know if it's something that you encounter in your
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:03.860]   practice. Underspending potentially relative to what someone could spend in retirement.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.180]   Obviously setting a spending rate for retirement is a humongous topic. We could spend a whole
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:15.500]   session on that one too. But how do people get comfortable with spending in retirement
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:22.000]   and are some people in your experience underspending relative to what they could spend? Can you
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.300]   share some thoughts and experiences on that issue?
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:37.180]   Sure. Yes. The first thing is, it is a huge transition. Going into retirement, people
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:43.420]   who save well and have been good accumulators, they've maybe even been paying down debt and
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:47.900]   they've been saving for a long time and now they have this nest egg for retirement and
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:53.540]   they've always lived within their means. It can be a rude awakening even though they know
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:50:00.280]   this is what they're going to do to take the plunge and now instead of adding to our assets,
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:09.020]   we are. We're taking distributions periodically. I think, especially in early years of retirement,
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:13.440]   I also think this makes sense because the early years of retirement, you have the longest
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:19.640]   time horizon, which just kind of means the range of outcomes is wider. But, especially
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:26.240]   in those early retirement years, there can be some hesitation with some people about
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:34.160]   spending. I think this is where kind of going through or working through having a financial
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:42.080]   plan, potentially an advisor, but it is really helpful to come alongside of you because one
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:47.700]   of the things that we've worked through is a lot of different stress tests. What is making
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:55.320]   you nervous about spending this money? You have saved it for this day, for this purpose.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:03.880]   A lot of people, they really want to steward their resources well. They have and they still
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:10.520]   are in the retirement years. One of the reasons why my clients have gone through this process
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:18.800]   with me is to be able to, in these early years of retirement, say, yes, your expenses are
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:24.520]   what they are or maybe are even higher than what they were five years ago. But, we have
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:31.160]   planned for that. We've planned for it in the portfolio too, expecting that this day
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:40.840]   that we're in, in market highs, is not going to be the day that we're in forever. I think
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:47.040]   there is some degree in which that, my hope is that that provides my clients some peace
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:55.480]   of mind in that process. But, there is a sense in which sometimes my job is to be encouraging
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:01.240]   my clients, even to think about what it is that brings them joy. Because some of the
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:09.440]   people that end up being the most concerned about spending, I think, in retirement, have
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:15.680]   more than enough. I feel very confident to say that about their situation. It would be
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:22.120]   very difficult for them to spend down everything that they have accumulated over the course
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.680]   of their lifetime thus far. So then, if that's the case, maybe they don't have anything in
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.240]   mind yet, but how can I come alongside of them to encourage them to think about what
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:40.320]   would bring them joy to spend money on? It's not true that everyone wants to go and travel
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:48.280]   around the world. That's not what everyone's desire is. But, maybe that person would be
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:54.560]   really excited about giving to, well, paying for their grandchild's education or some part
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:53:01.040]   of that. I have met a number of people where that isn't something they knew that they would
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:06.320]   be able to do, but now they've seen that they actually have the flexibility in their retirement
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:13.120]   years to go back and really help their children by helping their grandchildren. So, that's
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:19.360]   a neat opportunity, or would it give them great joy to give to a local charity that
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:26.160]   maybe they already volunteer with, and they are just trying to help them to think through
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:34.160]   what is important to them and what would be worthwhile to be stretching themselves in.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:42.640]   Especially when we've gone through the process of stress testing in a lot of different ways,
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:48.860]   the portfolio, but the long-term financial projections, and we could say with, again,
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:54.080]   some degree of confidence that you could be spending more. So, what would excite you about
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:54:03.920]   that? I think that's a great way to have another partner come alongside. I'd certainly, I love
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:11.760]   to see people who are in retirement who are not, who have gotten peace around that, around
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.320]   taking money out of their retirement accounts, and have just confidence because of the planning
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:22.960]   that they have already done, and what they're still continuing to do. It's not, you know,
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.720]   even one of those annual decisions, helping to pay for someone's college education, even,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.080]   they're not locking themselves into doing something every single year, so they still
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:40.040]   have flexibility to make different decisions in later retirement years.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:46.360]   That's terrific, and I think it's a good way to end on this idea of kind of bringing alignment
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:50.160]   with your money, and sort of what gives you joy, and what gives you meaning in your life.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:56.420]   I think this audience really resonates with that topic. So, Karabeth, thank you so much
