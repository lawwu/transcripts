[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.080]   Welcome, everyone, to Mogul Heads on Investing, podcast number 38.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.760]   Today, our special guest is Ted Aronson.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.960]   Ted was the founder of AJO, an institutional U.S. equity value manager, who at their peak
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.000]   was managing 31 billion in assets.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.200]   Today, we're going to be discussing David Swenson, the Yale model, Vanguard's forte
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.080]   into private equity, and Vanguard's shift towards active management or their personal
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.920]   advisor services clients.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.440]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host of Mogul Heads on Investing.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.560]   This episode, as with all episodes, is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.320]   Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.920]   You can find us at boglecenter.net, and your tax-deductible contributions are greatly appreciated.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.360]   Today, our special guest is Ted Aronson.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.960]   Ted has been in the institutional active management industry for more than 45 years.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.080]   He has a deep admiration for Jack Bogle, and was a personal friend for most of his career.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.480]   I believe Ted is in an ideal position to have a high-level conversation on Vanguard's forte
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.720]   into private equity investment for the masses, and a shift in the investment strategy of
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   Vanguard's personal advisor services, commonly known as PAS, towards new actively managed
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.640]   funds.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.520]   So, with no further ado, let me introduce our special guest, Ted Aronson.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.800]   Welcome to the Bogle Heads on Investing podcast, Ted.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.620]   Delighted to be here.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.640]   Before we get into this discussion today about whether investors should look at private equity
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.280]   in their portfolio, or actively managed funds as they look for return, can you tell us a
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.480]   little bit about your history, your background, and go as far back as you like?
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   I'd love to.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.720]   The beginning may be apocryphal, but my parents told me that they had pictures of me, I've
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.680]   never found them, of me looking at the stock page while I'm still wearing diapers.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.200]   I don't think that's true, but it still makes a good opening tale.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.920]   I was always a nut when it came to the stock market.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.040]   In those days, I just couldn't believe all these numbers changed every day.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.840]   And as an undergrad, I studied business, and then I went further in grad school, attending
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.480]   both undergrad and grad school at the Wharton School.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.240]   And I studied investment management at a time when I graduated in the early '70s, when no
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.040]   one cared about investment management.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.320]   Everybody wanted to be an investment banker, or a consultant, or some sexy high-paying
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320]   job.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   Well, little did I know that I would join Drexel Burnham Lombaire, and indeed start
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.000]   their quantitative equities group, when I was still in grad school.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.160]   So in 1974, I had my first job, which was a summer internship at Drexel, and that led
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.360]   to my opening career.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.800]   I was always interested in quantitative investing.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.440]   It was the beginning of what was called Modern Portfolio Theory, MPT.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.680]   And I was very proud at that quantitative equities group at Drexel to be hired to run
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.520]   the first equity mutual fund registered with the SEC to use this newfangled theory known
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   as MPT.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.600]   So that's where it all started.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.800]   And in the first years when I was at Drexel, I met Jack Vogel, who even back in the mid-70s
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.480]   was a force to contend with.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.200]   So I love to look back on my career and paraphrase Mark Twain, "I've been a CFA charter holder
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.120]   for 33 years, I've owned my own investment firm for 37 years, I've been an FOJ, a friend
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.400]   of Jack, for 45 years, and I've been a horse's ass for 69 years.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.000]   So I come to you, Rick, as all of the above."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Well, your firm, AJL, made an announcement last year that it was closing, and it was
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   a kind of a sad announcement.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.160]   I mean, I want to get into similarities between that and Jack Vogel and Julian Robertson back
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.480]   in 2000.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.760]   And here we are in 2020, and Ted Aronson is now closing his firm.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.640]   And it all had to do with bad timing, if you will, or not bad timing, just the cycles between
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.600]   value and growth.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   And Jack, of course, back in the late '60s, when he was running Wellington Management,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.520]   hired go-go managers to come in and take over almost Wellington.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.440]   And that collapsed on him and caused him to lose his job, and that was sort of the opposite.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.520]   He went with growth, and then growth collapsed, and value started to outperform, and the whole
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   thing fell apart on him, and that's how Vanguard got started.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.240]   So it was a good thing.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.600]   Then in 2000, at the peak of the peak of the peak-- I mean, March of 2000, the peak of
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.760]   the tech bubble, Julian Robertson closed Tiger Funds.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.000]   He decided to shut the door.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.240]   It was a value shop, deep value shop, and he closed.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:50.840]   So then along comes Ted in 2020, after this incredible run-up in basically large-cap growth,
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.680]   big stocks, which is not how you invest, and you make a decision to make a change.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   Tell me about that.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   Wow.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.720]   I'll leave it to you, Rick.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.560]   I must admit, I'll take a comparison to Jack Bogle, even if it's a painful one like that,
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   for both of us.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.880]   Indeed, you're absolutely true.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:19.120]   We did pull the plug on AJO a little less than a year ago, and it coincided with the
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.800]   longest and deepest run against value.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.040]   Painful decision, but we decided it was the best decision for our clients and for us.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.800]   As I joke with my value brethren, and I have many friends that are value managers, I was
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.960]   glad to take one for the team, because soon thereafter, that trend broke, or it seems
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.800]   to have broke, and at least small-cap value did very, very well.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:57.920]   AJO was a legacy firm that had been around for 37 years, and we were knee-deep in U.S.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.840]   domestic large-cap value stocks.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   After a 25-year run of solid, good performance, the prior five years had dragged our record
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.320]   down considerably, and that's where we thought the better part of valor was to give the money
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:23.800]   back to our clients, shudder, and go off and do other things.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.840]   Indeed, we did.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:33.000]   My partner Gina Moore and I are about to unveil, with a number of colleagues in Boston, a new
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.600]   firm called AJO Vista, which will not be as deep a value firm, but of course, value will
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.480]   come into play, because value makes sense in a lot of settings.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.520]   So, AJO will still exist, however, we did return the capital, it was about $11 billion
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.880]   at the time, and we're also delighted to be continuing with a new venture that will call
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.840]   upon any wisdom we've accumulated over all those many years, as I look back at my career.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.040]   So that's to come very, very soon.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.920]   Well, that's great to hear that you're not out, because ...
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.600]   First of all, the difference between value and growth, as far as valuations now, and
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.040]   what's going on, it's really amazing.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040]   Amazing.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.760]   And we're going to talk a little bit more about value later on in the show.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.520]   But first, we're going to talk about David Swenson.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.040]   And of course, David was a heavyweight in the investment industry.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:42.300]   He was a pioneer who basically put his career on hold to go to work for Yale as the chief
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.960]   investment officer there, and he created what was called the Yale model.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.680]   It's also called the endowment model, if I'm not mistaken, but most people call it the
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:59.460]   Yale model, who know David Swenson, where he began to use a lot more private equity,
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:07.280]   venture capital, private real estate investing, as opposed to going into public markets.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   That was very successful for Yale.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.640]   Not so successful for other endowments, who tried to copy or imitate the Yale model.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.920]   In fact, I wrote an article, called it the curse of the Yale model, which was, after
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.720]   he wrote his book, Pioneering Portfolio Management, which laid out for institutional investors
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.280]   how to do this, a lot of people tried.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.440]   But the problem was, they just weren't as skilled as the people who were working over
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   at Yale.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.680]   Which brings us to the point of, what's good for Yale is good for Yale, but it may not
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.160]   be good for other endowments.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.220]   It also may not be good for individual investors.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.760]   David Swenson was very adamant about the fact that most individual investors shouldn't be
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.760]   trying to do this.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.200]   They just don't have the resources to do it, they don't have the ability to go in.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   First of all, talk about your experiences with David, and talk about the Yale model,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   and what do you think about it all?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.600]   I'll be glad to.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.720]   Swenson was one of a kind.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   Not only was he a brilliant investor, I think we all know about his results as the CIO over
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.960]   decades for Yale, and their superb performance, but he was a great mentor.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.740]   He was a great teacher.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.080]   He was soft spoken, but he spoke his mind, but it was always a pleasure to be around
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.520]   him, and I loved hearing his opinion, even if I disagreed with it.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   He made the point, and this was amplified by Jason Zweig, in an obit he wrote for David.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.760]   He said, "Play your own game.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.480]   Do what you're good at.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.280]   Don't just copy people.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.800]   Don't just say, 'Yale and Harvard did something, so I'm going to do the same thing.'"
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.160]   Not due diligence, that's copying.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.920]   He was dead set against it, and I think he was correct.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.480]   I always think that his advice was akin to Warren Buffett, who announced a portfolio
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:12.340]   of Vanguard S&P 500 index fund, and T-bills would be just fine in many cases.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.820]   David knew his strengths.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:19.040]   He was not modest about his strengths, but it was quite an endeavor.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   He had a seriously intelligent investment staff at Yale.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:32.320]   He had serious leverage with managers, by which I mean he could get superior fees, and
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.360]   he was not against funding new ideas and new managers.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:45.160]   That just described quite a few activities that I suspect 99% and 44% of most investors
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.240]   can't do.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.280]   Those that can should, and there are a handful of them, but most of us shouldn't.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.320]   Alternatives, and you've mentioned, Rick, a number of them.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.040]   Private equity comes to mind because you may have noticed they're now advertising on TV
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.520]   how good the private equity industry is.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.840]   Oh boy, didn't Jack Bogle say, "Run for the hills," when he started advertising on national
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   TV?
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.240]   I think he was right on that, as well as other things.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.600]   There is absolutely nothing wrong with private equity.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.240]   Indeed, there's a lot in favor of it.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.360]   I got to '74 when I graduated from the Wharton School.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.840]   Clearly, money management is sexier.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.600]   It's more interesting today.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:43.520]   Clearly, the best graduates from Wharton, Chicago, Stanford, Harvard, they are going
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.040]   to enter the private equity field.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   I really feel that.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.840]   I think marketable securities may have suffered a little because of that brain drain.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.200]   Private equity attracts the best and the brightest.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.300]   They have the resources.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.320]   They have the research departments.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.160]   They have the means to perhaps make superior investments.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:11.720]   I now pregnantly pause, but they also charge too much.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:20.760]   In my opinion, any advantage they garner is offset by higher fees, so the success of private
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.980]   equity in the main and broadly, of course, generalizing here to make a point, accrues
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:32.800]   to the private equity managers, not to the private equity owners.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.280]   I feel that very strongly.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.240]   Was there a time in the '70s where this was available to David Swenson and others?
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   Yes.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.080]   Were their returns more attractive than they are now?
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   Yes.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.520]   Were the fees lower?
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   No.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.400]   They were higher then too, but there were more returns to support them.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:14:00.520]   I feel very strongly that that is not the case today and that the fundamental factors
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:09.080]   of supply and demand, meaning dough chasing deals, has become so distorted that I suspect
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:16.840]   the next 10 years may be sorry times for private equity investors versus what they think they're
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.200]   going to get based on the past.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:27.120]   Well, that's important because Vanguard wants to take individual investors into the realm
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:34.680]   of private equity, not just large institutional investors or high net worth investors.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:43.960]   In an interview that Barry Ritzel from Bloomberg did with Fran Kinnery last month in August,
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.320]   Fran is now the global head of private investments at Vanguard.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.320]   He's had several jobs.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.800]   I've met Fran several times.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:59.120]   They want to take target date funds into the realm of private equity and to a fairly large
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   extent.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:08.160]   He's talking along the lines of 30% of equity in a portfolio should be allocated to private
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.880]   equity.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:18.160]   That's shocking to me that it would, number one, be that high, but also, number two, that
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:25.560]   Vanguard making this move into private equity with really no experience at all, not that
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.080]   they're not smart people because I know they are and they're very good people and their
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.720]   heart is in it and so forth, but I question whether they're at the caliber of a Yale endowment
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.800]   fund who can go out and pick the best private equity managers.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.440]   I guess we'll have to wait and see.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.560]   Let me circle back to David Swenson for a second because David Swenson wouldn't agree
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.680]   with Vanguard.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.800]   David talked about this in his book, Pioneering Portfolio Management, the second edition.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.760]   He also wrote another book called Unconventional Success, which was for individual investors
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.120]   and he writes about it there, too.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.080]   Basically, he writes that no middle ground exists.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.160]   Low-cost passive strategies, as outlined in Unconventional Success, suit the overwhelming
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:17.720]   number of individual and institutional investors without the time, resources, and ability to
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.520]   make high-quality active management decisions.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.840]   The framework outlined in Pioneering Portfolio Management applies to only a small number
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:33.120]   of investors with the resources and the temperament to pursue the grail of risk-adjusted returns.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:42.960]   This was in 2009 and in 2012, at a conference for John Bogle, it was the John Bogle Legacy
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.920]   Forum, which both you and I were at, interesting, and there was a book about it by Newt Rothschild,
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.480]   The Man in the Arena, which talked about this conference and a lot of other things, where
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:00.920]   he quoted Swenson in here and he was even more adamant there, where he said that, "I
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.800]   think the only sensible way to structure an active management program is to have a group
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:14.820]   of incredibly highly qualified professionals who devote their entire careers to trying
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.800]   to find managers or investment strategies that can beat the market."
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.520]   So he's even stronger than what he wrote about in his book.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.520]   All right.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   So now we have Vanguard come along saying, "Target date retirement fund should have private
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520]   equity in it."
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:36.320]   Now, granted, it isn't going to be the individual who's going to be trying to pick the private
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   equity manager.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.840]   Vanguard has already done that.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.440]   They've gone out and picked a company called HarborVest.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   It's a global manager.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.800]   I mean, they have a global footprint and it looks like they're managing about $80 billion
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.080]   in assets.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.200]   What do you think about Vanguard's forte into private equity and what do you think about
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.040]   adding it to the accounts that they manage, which would be institutional accounts, target
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:07.440]   date funds, and also the personal advisor service, PAS?
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.360]   Oh, boy.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.360]   Multiple questions.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.760]   Let me try to hit all of them.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.600]   First and foremost, I think Jack is spinning in his grave, that is, if he's still there,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.040]   if he hasn't gone somewhere else.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.480]   And you summarized it well.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:33.840]   I don't know HarborVest, except what I've read, the news of Vanguard, nor am I privy
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.360]   to the details because this is a personal investment.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.560]   It's not the public markets with Vanguard's great disclosure and transparency.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:49.240]   I think if we had a crystal ball and we could look forward and we looked back, the private
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.320]   equity Vanguard will introduce, with their good points you mentioned about them, they're
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.200]   thoughtful, smart people.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:07.640]   The returns will probably be competitive after fees with the returns from the public markets.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.440]   Even though I think the public markets are relatively high now, just as private equity
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   deals are high, so both those numbers may be in the low single digits.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.080]   I understand from a business point of view why Vanguard is pursuing this.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:30.840]   They have their trillions of assets, and they want to provide all they can to their clients,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.000]   and they don't want assets disappearing to some other operation, organization that will
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   be offering private equity.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.960]   I get it.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:46.400]   However, I wonder ... I don't have a lot of first-hand experience with private equity,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.200]   but I have a lot of second-hand experience with private equity.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.240]   One in particular, Spelman College, I'll outline in a second.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.160]   I think they will do a good job of providing private equity.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:08.200]   However, when their fees, they'll have to add on top of the costs of HarborVest and
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   all the other related charges.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.440]   I don't think they'll have anything that's particularly competitive, certainly not as
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:22.560]   competitive as their rock-bottom fees, an area that they really pioneered for all intents
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   and purposes.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:31.640]   Lots of competition now, but we all know Jack started this in the '70s, and he was successful
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.080]   even beyond his expectations.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.960]   Businesses can subcontract with the talent you mentioned, Rick.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.560]   They can hire really smart consultants, and there are a number of them.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.240]   I've dealt with them all my career.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.600]   They can, in a sense, get the investment thinking they need.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.880]   Those consulting firms that are worth their salt really do a great job.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.320]   However, and by the way, I'm sorry, one other thing, institutions can negotiate in many
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:09.440]   cases, like Swenson and I mentioned earlier, negotiate some favorable fees.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:17.480]   However, the aggregate fees are so large compared to what Vanguard provides in its meat and
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.000]   potatoes work that there's really no comparison.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.400]   I fear that investors will get involved with the Vanguard offering, expecting it to be
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:37.440]   more outstanding, to be unique in the area of fees, just as their passive index products
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440]   are.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:44.520]   I think that will be a major misunderstanding, which will cause problems.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.320]   Vanguard is good at communicating.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.760]   They're good at getting the word out there.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:57.480]   I think many of their clientele, much of their clientele, may just go along with the startlingly
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.560]   large private equity allocations you mentioned a moment ago.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.040]   They surprised me as well.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.560]   Let me circle back to the interview that Barry Ritzold, Bloomberg Opinion columnist, had
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.760]   with Fran Kennery, and this is on Masters in Business podcast, but there's a few things
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.720]   that struck me.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:26.160]   Number one, the firm that they chose, HarberVest, has 75 billion or so under management and
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   commitments to 80.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:37.880]   Vanguard is roughly an $8 trillion company, and Vanguard is managing maybe $4.5 trillion
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.120]   of equity in total.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:46.520]   They were talking about taking ... The numbers don't make sense, but up to some percentage
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.840]   of that, moving it over slowly to private equity.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.080]   The reason I say it doesn't make sense is because HarberVest is only managing, like
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:01.160]   I said, 75 billion, and I mean, just a little bit of movement by Vanguard and shareholders
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.600]   over to this fund is going to flood HarberVest.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.880]   I don't think it will happen because I don't think that Vanguard and HarberVest will allow
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.080]   this flood to occur, so we're really talking about a small amount of money from Vanguard
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.880]   investors actually going into this product, but if they democratize this, because France
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.520]   says right in the interview, and I'm just taking this right off of Barry's website because
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.800]   they have a printout, "It took us 35 years to do this in indexing, 20 years to do it
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.960]   in active, so maybe 20 years from now, private equity and access to world-class managers
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:43.240]   for the average investor will look very much like indexing did over the course of 1975
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   to 1995."
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:52.800]   In other words, you're trying to democratize private equity and make it accessible to
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.480]   everybody at somewhat relatively lower fees, but how can you do that?
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.720]   I mean, how can you pour so much money into private equity and make it kind of index-like
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.440]   and expect to get the same return?
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.480]   Rick, you really can't.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.880]   Let me take your democratic image back.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:19.000]   In 1974, when I'm a young Turk running money at an old established firm in Philadelphia,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.840]   the market wasn't available.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.840]   You had to hire a money manager to get the market, to get a diversified portfolio, to
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.000]   essentially get what now is called beta, exposure to capital markets.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.280]   What Jack did in his democratization program was democratized capital market returns.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:46.360]   They are out there from the entire economy, which in capitalism has companies which make
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.120]   money and pay out dividends and retain earnings and grow, blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.840]   We all know the story, and that's a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.800]   And Jack deserves credit for that.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:08.120]   You really can't make the leap to a specialized, alpha-seeking operation like all the private
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.000]   equity and make the same comparison.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.480]   You have a limited number of deals being chased by an infinite amount of money, and it just
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.200]   doesn't compute.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.600]   It can't be.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.500]   So I think that's the bullishness coming out.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:30.000]   Despite the growth goals of Vanguard's private investments, it's an impossibility.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.320]   It just can't be done.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.160]   I think in all the private equity, they found something like a trillion dollars of dry powder
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.880]   of committed capital, something like that.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.200]   And those are the biggest numbers that have ever been seen.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.000]   So can you imagine throwing in a couple other trillion on top of that, chasing the same
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   deals?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I don't think so.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.920]   And you have at least one right now, they've picked one private equity manager, HarborVest,
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   just one company.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920]   Exactly.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.800]   And so you're only going to get the deals that they are in.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:06.360]   Now, HarborVest will then go out and sub-advise or hire sub-advisors, according to their website.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:13.200]   They'll hire sub-advisors in various areas and get in other advisors' deals, if you will,
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.320]   so that they can get broader exposure.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.240]   Because one thing that Fran Kennery said in the interview with Barry was that you're looking
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:30.520]   at maybe 600 to 800 operating companies in the fund that Vanguard investors will be in.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:36.320]   And the only way that could happen-- and again, I went to the HarborVest website, and I heard
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.960]   or read-- is that they're going to go out and they're going to hire other managers.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.280]   So they're going to be just taking deals of other private equity and venture capital.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.800]   But let me quote what the expectation of return is.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.720]   And here's where I almost kind of fell over in the chair, if you will.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   OK, please.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   OK.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:00.840]   So first, Fran was talking about HarborVest has been getting 700 to 800 basis points over
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   the public markets.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.240]   That's what they've been saying.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:11.440]   But would Vanguard's forward-looking estimates to our investors-- and this is just quoting
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:19.880]   him-- get between 300 to 400 basis points, or 3% to 4% more than public equity?
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.880]   Wow.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   Really?
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.160]   I mean, everybody's going to get that?
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.160]   Seriously?
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.160]   Yep.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.160]   It's going to be just that easy?
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.440]   I don't know.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   Tell me.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.640]   Well, my first reaction to what you said, Rick, is bingo.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.960]   Because, of course, no one's going to get it.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   It's silly.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:44.400]   Could they do 300 or 400 over the next couple of years before fees?
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   Maybe.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.160]   Fees will reduce it to maybe 100 basis points.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.920]   So now we're talking about public markets plus a little alpha, if you will, thrown in.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.000]   Let's call it alpha, because that's what active managers are all about.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.840]   300 or 400 is silly.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:08.400]   700 or 800 may be true, but that was when HarborVest was small.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.680]   And that's when there were a limited number of deals.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.600]   I'm not saying there aren't smart enough people to get returns like that.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.400]   I would love to run out and hire them when they're young and they're new.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.880]   But because they're young and they're new, nobody knows about them, or very few people
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   do.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:31.960]   So the return expectations are, in my opinion, scary and silly, as you note.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:40.320]   Private equity returns are very close to lower cap value returns, at least historically.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:46.500]   And that's absolutely true with one addition, and that's leverage.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:52.320]   Private equity deals usually entail leverage, not always wild amounts of leverage, but some
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   leverage.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:29:02.760]   And if you do that to things like mid-cap value returns, you get private equity returns.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.360]   I want to circle back to a portfolio that I put together.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.160]   I called it the total economy portfolio.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:15.400]   And let's say I want my portfolio to look more like the economy than the stock market.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.160]   So what do I need to add to this portfolio to make it look more like GDP or national
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.720]   earnings rather than stock market earnings?
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.880]   And so the first thing that pops out is real estate.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.280]   You need to have a bigger real estate component, because so little of real estate is actually
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.920]   securitized in the stock market.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:39.880]   So you add to your total stock market US and total international fund, you add a real estate
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.880]   fund.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   And I'm not going to get into international real estate.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.160]   It makes it too complicated.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:50.480]   Let's just add 10% to the Vanguard real estate or an actual REIT fund, because the Vanguard
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.560]   fund is no longer just a pure REIT fund anymore.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.800]   Second thing, how do you emulate all the private equity?
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.400]   Something like half-- let's call it half of all of the national earnings are from companies
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.160]   that are privately owned, and the other half-- and this is very general-- is from publicly
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   traded companies.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.400]   So how do you emulate the other half?
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.560]   And the answer is, as we touched on, is to use small cap value.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:18.360]   Small cap value emulates, to some extent-- and I know if you leverage it, it emulates
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.080]   it more-- the performance of private equity.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.800]   So in my total economy portfolio, which I created I don't know how many years ago--
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:33.640]   and I have it on a website called core4.com, this total economy portfolio concept.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:40.160]   And it is closer to what the total economy is and less of what the stock market is.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.520]   Now, circling back to what you brought up, if you want to do private equity and you don't
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.120]   have small cap value in your portfolio, why not just add that first?
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.120]   And that's a question to you.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.120]   I'm just shaking my head.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.120]   Bingo.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.120]   Yeah, why wouldn't you?
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   I'm with you.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   But go back.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   Tell me that website again you have.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.120]   I don't-- I'm not familiar with it.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.120]   The website is core, C-O-R-E-4.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.120]   Gotcha.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   C-O-R-E-4.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:13.320]   Now, what that website is-- and I don't want to belabor this, but they're just simple portfolios.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.600]   In other words, if you need income, use these four funds.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.680]   If you're looking for the total market type strategy, use these funds.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.480]   And if you want to have the portfolio look more like the economy than the stock market,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   then use these funds.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.600]   My whole view was, like, you can do anything you want with four funds.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.400]   You don't need more than four funds, because there's so much product out there right now
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.920]   that you can create whatever you want, any strategy you want, with four very low-cost
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   index funds.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   So that was the whole concept.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   Even ESG.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   I have that as part of it as well.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.080]   So that's what that is.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.600]   And that's where this total economy portfolio is.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   It's a free website.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   You can go there.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   It just goes on its own.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.040]   I don't even know how many people visit it, but it's there.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.100]   So that's where I have this total economy portfolio.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:57.160]   But I also wrote an article for it about-- about it for Forbes back in, I don't know,
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   2007 and 2008.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.880]   And I talked about this.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.680]   And it kind of gave people a backdoor way to get into small-cap value who maybe ordinarily
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.480]   wouldn't have gotten into small-cap value.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   Yep.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   I understand.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   And--
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   I think it's absolutely brilliant.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   And again--
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   Oh, well, thank you.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.480]   I should just end the podcast right here.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:19.160]   Yeah, end the podcast and go into that business and get out of this crazy stuff.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:25.560]   And yes, it was a Harvard professor-- I remember him well-- a couple of years ago, Randy Cohen,
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.160]   who convinced me that he used mid-cap value.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:36.400]   He said, simply leverage mid-cap value stocks at 60%, set it up in a vehicle that you could
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:43.520]   value it on a lagged three-month basis, make the liquidity not instantaneous, not totally
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.360]   liquid, and you get private equity or you get more than private equity.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   I buy it.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   I agree with it.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.500]   Think of what private equity firms do, except for the Heinzes of the world and those sort
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:01.760]   of takeovers, they're after value-oriented companies in the small and mid-cap range who
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.720]   can have value exploited.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   Duh.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.040]   I mean, that's what they're doing.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.120]   And throw in that use of leverage, which scares most investors, and you have the return stream
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.560]   that mimics it.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.480]   I agree.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   But Rick, you also know so much on Wall Street is sold, not bought.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:29.200]   I'm involved with an unnamed state investment portfolio as an advisor, and they have public
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.440]   meetings on a monthly basis, and it used to be in person.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.720]   It hasn't been for quite a while.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:43.540]   And I'm telling you from the dais where I sit, you can pick out the private equity sales
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.540]   people.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.540]   Why?
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.080]   Because they're the best looking and the best dressed.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.200]   It's obvious.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:56.040]   It's so obvious that, you know, after a couple of beers, it's a really funny game of picking
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   them out.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.360]   And I'm telling you, they're all good looking.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.160]   The men are good looking, the women are good looking, they're like, you know, the quarterback
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.320]   and the prom queen, and they're dressed to the nines.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.520]   It's hilarious.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.960]   So you nailed it, and you get it, and that's what's going on.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.720]   Because this is not logic.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   This is sales.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.400]   This is what Wall Street is so good at.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:27.640]   They are expert at separating clients from their money, and they continue to do so.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:35.220]   And unfortunately, to some extent, to a small extent, Vanguard has become part of the problem.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.220]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.760]   Well, I mean, if Vanguard's getting into this, of course, Fidelity will get into it and others
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   will.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.760]   Oh, my God.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760]   Of course.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.760]   Of course.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   Of course.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.760]   But if people do decide to go down this road.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:52.360]   You know, instead of leveraged mid cap, just look at deep, small cap value.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:35:01.240]   And I can give you some fun names, Avantis small cap value, or the DFA targeted value,
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:10.440]   or Invesco pure S&P 600 small value, RZV, and full disclosure, I own RZV.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:16.160]   This is just simply saying, look, I want to have something other than beta in my portfolio,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.440]   because I think that it might help improve the performance in the long term.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.560]   I'm not going to get access to good private equity without paying an arm and a leg.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   Yep.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   Just do a small cap value fund instead.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.440]   Do a small REIT fund, do the total economy portfolio, which is what I do.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.720]   That's my strategy in my own account, and be happy, and do it for 20 years at least.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.720]   That's a given.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.880]   I think that Vanguard has been going down the path lately, not just with this announcement,
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.760]   which actually is a kind of an old announcement, it came out last year, but more recently adding
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:58.080]   new actively managed funds to their personal advisor service.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.480]   They've added three new actively managed funds for people who want them.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:09.840]   So Tim Buckley, who is the CEO of Vanguard, seems to be pivoting towards active management
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:18.200]   and towards the idea that somehow Vanguard has the secret sauce and can pick active managers
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.440]   that will add alpha.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   Have you noticed that?
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.440]   Because that's certainly what I've been picking up.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.960]   I have been picking up.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:35.560]   And listen, I'm an active manager, I still have faith against all odds that I can add
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   value.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.280]   Most of my brethren are the same.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.680]   If Tim thinks that way, okay, again, they're smart guys and they've got a lot of resources,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.480]   their fees may be low, but when you multiply a basis point times $4.5 trillion, you're
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.840]   talking about real money.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.520]   Maybe they can, but I've always found Vanguard to be realistic in their expectations.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.720]   They're solidly conservative with their capital market projections.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.440]   I applaud that.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:12.360]   So if they were to pursue active managers, I think they would hope for alpha in the 50
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:19.840]   basis points to 150 basis point range, something reasonable that may be achievable for a limited
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.860]   amount of their assets.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.800]   But is Vanguard successful at picking active managers?
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:33.520]   And is this meandering down the road towards active managers, stock funds and private equity,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.240]   are they the Yale team, so to speak?
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:43.900]   And I question that because we have data on Vanguard's active managers and what Vanguard
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:50.840]   likes to put out is data, the last thing I read was the data on 10 years, and again,
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:59.920]   this came from Fran, 30 of 37 Vanguard stock funds outperformed their Lipper Peer Group
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   averages.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:07.080]   Notice they didn't say outperformed the market, okay, they outperformed it over a 10-year
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.400]   period of time.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.920]   However, they didn't talk about the funds that closed, and over a 10-year period of
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:23.140]   time, they actually closed nine funds, and most of that was from not performing well.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:28.520]   The latest casualty was the Vanguard US value, but over that 10-year period of time, they
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.000]   had closed nine actively managed funds, mostly because the performance wasn't.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.520]   And so, yes, I know the narrative is that, look at the funds that we currently still
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:45.920]   have, survivorship, three-quarters of them outperformed the average fund in their category,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.980]   therefore we must be good.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.980]   Maybe they are.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.000]   And granted, I've done a lot of work on fees.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.920]   If you have lower fees, if you're able to negotiate lower fees with active managers,
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.520]   you will get closer to the market return on average.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.680]   You won't outperform the market from what I've seen, but you can get closer to the average
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.200]   market return because your fees are lower.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.680]   To me, it's mostly a random event.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.760]   I mean, you're going to go out and hire some good managers, but whether they continue to
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.800]   outperform or not, it gets to be a random event.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.600]   If you look at SPIVA data and you look at other data, you know, the ones who did outperform
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.080]   the top quartile, some of them stay in the top quartile.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.880]   So if your fees are low enough, maybe you're going to be in that upper-lipper category
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.280]   just because of that.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.080]   But when you start looking at your performance by taking away the survivorship bias, it just
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.360]   doesn't look so good.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.960]   And we've had no experience-- and maybe I'm wrong on this, because he did say that they
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:47.040]   had Vanguard managers all in very large institutional portfolios, and there they do go out and try
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.940]   to select private equity managers.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.780]   So they have some experience doing that, but not on this scale, right?
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:40:00.980]   So now, you know, Fran, who is in charge of all this, going out on a very large scale
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:06.900]   to try to find one private equity manager who's going to be it, I just see that they're
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.940]   probably going to have to add more managers as they move along here, right?
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.940]   Absolutely.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:17.540]   I do have to tell you, my love of Jack Bogle-- and I really did, he was a professional friend.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.640]   I adored him.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:26.140]   My love of him lets me forgive the marketing comments that you so eloquently just hit upon.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:33.220]   Yes, it hit me when I read that statistic of 30 out of 37, that what happened to the
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.220]   ones that didn't survive?
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.340]   I mean, that's the oldest game in the book.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:43.140]   I'm not sure if Bogle would have let that pass him on his watch, but OK, all of Wall
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.460]   Street seems to do this in Vanguards, just being typical.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.300]   You hit upon it, Rick.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:53.020]   Vanguard is changing its complexion a little.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:59.380]   We hope not a lot, or at least I would not be in their phones if I thought a lot.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.580]   And I forgive them some of their sins, because they just want to get involved more and more.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:10.540]   So I get what they're doing, but you would expect it more from other shops.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.380]   Vanguard is clearly changing to some extent, no doubt about it.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.580]   So I can't disagree with all of your observation.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:24.180]   Well, interesting, when they announced three new actively managed funds for the personal
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:29.780]   advisor service, PAS program, they put in their press release that these funds will
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:39.780]   complement diversified and low-cost index core portfolio holdings in PAS accounts.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:47.300]   Vanguard believes the funds concentrated higher alpha strategies are an ideal fit for PAS
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:52.700]   clients with sufficient risk tolerance and patience for active exposure, as they can
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:58.780]   materially impact portfolio performance even at a relatively small allocation.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.980]   That's not something Jack Bogle would say, and it's not something--
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.980]   I hadn't gotten.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.980]   No.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   And David Swensen wouldn't say it either.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:10.580]   But circling back to David Swensen, we're kind of pounding this thing home.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:14.100]   He says, look, if you believe that you have the ability to outperform the market, if you
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.340]   believe they have the ability to pick active managers who can outperform, why would you
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.340]   index anything?
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.540]   You go out and you buy all active managers.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.340]   I mean, what about-- why doing this core and satellite thing?
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.340]   Why bother?
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.340]   Why, touche.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:32.820]   In the funds that you're referring to, the active funds, do they publish the names of
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.260]   them, or do they just hold this out as a generic category?
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:44.380]   The new funds that they've announced are the Vanguard Advice Select Dividend Growth Fund,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:51.420]   the Vanguard Advice Select Global Value Fund, and the Vanguard Advice Select International
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.300]   Growth Fund.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.620]   Those three actively managed mutual funds-- they're not ETFs, they're mutual funds-- will
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:03.960]   be available to PAS, or Personal Advisor Service, clients going forward.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.820]   Now, I have my own theories on why they're doing this, and it has nothing to do with
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:07.820]   active management.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.900]   It has to do with complexity is job security, OK?
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.980]   In other words, so my comment, tongue in cheek, is that complexity is job security.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.500]   And the reason I say that is because I've been an advisor for 33 years.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.160]   Oh, please, I'm with you.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:27.580]   If you just put four funds in a portfolio, the total stock market, the total international,
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.980]   the total bond, and the total international bond, which is the four funds that Vanguard
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.800]   puts in every PAS client's portfolio, if they go there in cash, they're going to get these
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   four funds.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   Yep.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.980]   I, as an advisor-- and now I'm just doing an hourly model, so I'm not managing money
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.980]   anymore.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   So people come to me and say, what do you think?
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.900]   I say, well, you know, it's pretty easy for you to just manage those funds yourself.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.820]   I mean, why would you pay 0.3%, right?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.940]   And oh, by the way, the life strategy funds have the exact same four funds in it, that
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.860]   you could just buy one fund and get the same thing for a lower price.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.900]   So why would you do it?
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.900]   Of course.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:06.220]   And by the way, a lot of clients, a lot of the clients had already terminated Vanguard
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.180]   and were terminating them, or did make a decision whether to go to Vanguard or not.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.100]   Now, I think that PAS program is great if you need to have somebody else manage the
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.500]   portfolio for you.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.740]   And especially if you have this estate planning thing, where if something happens to you and
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.340]   you're the one who's doing all the money thing at home, and you're afraid of your spouse
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.380]   or your family not being able to manage the money, great, PAS is wonderful.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.020]   I think they're wonderful.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.460]   But there's no return incentive there.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.940]   Well, this now creates a return incentive.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.500]   And why would you do that?
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:41.340]   Well, maybe because they're losing assets from people who say, I can do this on my own.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.820]   And make it a little bit more complicated, you know, make it a little bit more scary
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.820]   in a way.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.500]   Maybe retain more assets.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.660]   That's my biased opinion from being an advisor for 33 years.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.660]   Well, wow.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.660]   You're something.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.660]   You are something else.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.380]   But your reputation preceded you, so I was aware of it.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.380]   I agree.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.380]   I agree.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.140]   And oh, do I agree.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:09.740]   Now, new paragraph, I think their low-cost consulting services, the 30 basis points for
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:15.300]   this personal advice service, make sense in ways that you can appreciate as an advisor,
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.800]   that I can appreciate as an institutional money manager.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   People do need hand-holding.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.300]   They do need advice.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.860]   They do need help.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.340]   It's just funny to me.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:30.500]   It used to be Vanguard had a single focus, a crystal clear focus.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.820]   Well, they don't anymore.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.340]   And they're getting into some of the same nonsense that plagues Wall Street.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.260]   Not going to swear of consulting services, although I'm not a consultant.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.500]   I think there can be value.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.660]   But I think all the reasons you just said are absolutely true as well.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.500]   So I can't really defend it strongly.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:55.660]   New paragraph, because I was preparing for this call just kind of daydreaming, thinking.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:01.740]   I realized that the Ted Aaronson investment philosophy for the ages, which of course was
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:07.460]   stolen from Jack Bogle and everybody else I respected, boils down to three things.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.900]   One is keep costs down, and costs are not just fees, they're taxes and all that other
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.900]   crap.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:19.460]   So keep costs down, two, diversify, arguably the only free lunch in capital market theory,
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.580]   and three, the one that's a surprise, take risk.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.620]   And take risk would fall under your small value, okay?
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.820]   That's riskier than the S&P 500 without a doubt.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.980]   Could it be for David Swensen, private equity and venture capital?
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.100]   Absolutely.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:41.260]   But he kept the cost down and he diversified even those bets.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.620]   So that triumvirate has served me well when you think about it.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.540]   And you can fit a lot of, cram a lot of stuff into those three categories.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:55.380]   So if someone wants to sleep well, they want to be tucked into a handful of Vanguard index
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.000]   funds, fine, and be done with it and leave it alone.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.100]   You want to have some fun and take some risk and maybe make more money, do it intelligently,
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.340]   diversify and get it as inexpensively as possible.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.260]   It's really that simple.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:13.380]   And you eat your own cooking, because if I recall over the years, you've been very vocal
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.940]   about how you invest your family money.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:17.940]   Yes.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.940]   I have.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.380]   And you use a lazy portfolio.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.300]   Could you just talk about that for a second?
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.300]   Sure.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.340]   All the lazy portfolio, and it was kind of a fun, silly exercise with a reporter named
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:32.900]   Paul Farrell many years ago, where he said, and he asked David Swensen the same thing.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.180]   He was in the same sort of survey.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.500]   What would you recommend a portfolio for someone that has a day job?
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:45.780]   So assume you do your regular institutional big shot money management practice, Ted, but
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.160]   what do you do with your own money on the side?
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.900]   And that's where I said, and indeed it's true, a handful of Vanguard mutual funds and never
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.380]   change them.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.740]   Now people went crazy and they said, how dare you give advice?
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:05.900]   I published something about 60 or 70% equity and 20% fixed and 10% cash.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.500]   And they said, how dare you give that advice too, because everybody's unique.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:15.260]   I said, please, all I was saying was, of course you should reflect your risk profile and the
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.580]   needs of a particular family or individual.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:24.780]   But in general, I was reflecting what I had learned since the seventies, which was the
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.100]   Yale model, the endowment model.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:33.660]   In equity bias, invest in inefficient markets.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.660]   Don't worry about liquidity.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.660]   Leave it there.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.860]   Leave it alone and diversify.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:44.580]   And so the sense behind an endowment model wasn't like, you know, the 10 commandments
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.260]   from on high.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:51.700]   It was tried and true investment principles that were reflected.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   And David was smart enough to say, be careful how you manifest these, unless you're set
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.060]   up to do so.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:05.740]   This is your point break about full time staff, competence, blah, blah, blah, those sort of
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.740]   things.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.420]   So David had no allusion to why Yale did so well.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.380]   Yes, he was a long-term investor.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:19.580]   Yes, he took advantages of big dips like '09 dip, but the other principles were things
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.340]   that have served investors well forever.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.260]   They really have.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.380]   So Ted, it's been really great having you here.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:31.260]   In closing, is there any special memory that you have about Jack?
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   I do, Rick.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:39.180]   A year before Jack died, the CFA Institute, which I'm a proud member of, held its annual
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:43.700]   conference, a couple of thousand people here in Philadelphia, obviously before the pandemic.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:51.960]   And Jack, being the local hero in the Philadelphia area, agreed to participate on one condition.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.780]   And that condition was that it'd be a question and answer, and that I am the moderator.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:03.940]   Now you say, wow, Ted, I think you're an interesting guy, but I didn't think you were that interesting.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.180]   Why would Jack want you as moderator?
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.780]   And the reason is the following.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:13.620]   And we did this Mutton Jeff Act dozens of times.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:19.820]   He would get up, and then he would announce, why would I, the king of indexing, he never
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:25.940]   said that, but the indexer, have a 40-year friendship, this is a couple of years ago,
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.780]   with an active manager, Ted Aaronson.
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.220]   And there's a pregnant pause.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:37.420]   And then he would say, because Ted and his partners at AJO put their money where their
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.860]   mouths are.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:45.860]   They're active managers which charge fees according to their performance-based principles.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:52.300]   And when we don't deliver the outperformance we say we can out-deliver, our fee is zero.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.380]   Zero.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:59.620]   And that was the perfect segue into all the stuff that Jack said so eloquently.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:03.020]   True story, there are 2,000 people in the audience.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.740]   And I, of course, was embarrassed, and it also made my career, because I loved being
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.740]   that foil.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.140]   I loved playing that role.
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.820]   To Jack Vogel, oh my God, how flattering was that?
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.820]   So that's my tale.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:19.340]   Well, thank you, Ted, and we so much thank you for being on Vogel Heads on Investing
