[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   Well, should I pursue my dream or should I pursue obedience?
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.920]   It's a question a lot of Christians face when thinking about career options or career
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   changes.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   And today it comes to us from a listener to the podcast named Josh.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.440]   "Hi Pastor John and thank you for Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.680]   The podcast recently I've been thinking of a career change.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.120]   I've been listening to a lot of podcasts that simply talk about creating your dream job
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.480]   or simply call us to follow our heart.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.040]   Some of these podcasts are even hosted by Christians.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.000]   I don't want to get caught up in pursuing the American dream of being successful, making
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.360]   more, working less, and achieving my full potential, especially if this is all from
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720]   just a heart of earthly gain.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.800]   But I also don't want to ignore what I believe are God-given passions and talents in my life,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.240]   or are they?
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.320]   That would simultaneously give me a significant pay raise and a lifestyle improvement.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880]   Is there a difference between pursuing our dreams and being obedient with the gifts and
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.120]   passions God has given us, or are those the same thing?"
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.360]   Pastor John, what would you say to Josh?
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.040]   Well, let's start like this.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.860]   The Bible never says that the way you decide what you ought to do is by following what
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.960]   you want to do.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.240]   And the Bible never says that the way you decide what you ought to do is by following
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.400]   what you don't want to do.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.000]   Or to say it another way, the Bible never teaches that if you want to do something,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.320]   it's wrong to do it.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.640]   And the Bible never teaches that if you don't want to do something, therefore it's right
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.480]   to do it.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.360]   Or let's put it positively.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.200]   The Bible teaches that you ought to love doing what you ought to do.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:11.360]   It is right and good to love doing what is right and good.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.720]   Moral action and satisfying action can be the same.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.880]   For example, Romans 12.8, "Let the one who leads lead with zeal, and let the one
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.760]   who does acts of mercy do them with cheerfulness."
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.080]   In other words, it's right to lead and it's right to do acts of mercy and it's right
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.920]   to love to do these things.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   Or 1 Peter 5.2, he speaks to pastors like this, "Shepherd the flock of God that is
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:58.360]   among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, not for shameful
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360]   gain, but eagerly."
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.680]   In other words, it's right to shepherd the flock and it's right to exercise oversight
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.040]   and it's right to do these willingly and eagerly.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.300]   It's right to love doing them, to enjoy doing them, which is precisely what it says
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.320]   in Hebrews 13.17, "Let your leaders lead with joy and not with groaning, for that would
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.040]   be of no advantage to you."
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.800]   In other words, it's right for church leaders to lead and it's right for this leading
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.480]   to be joyful.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.520]   They should love to lead God's flock.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   Or as the psalmist says in Psalm 40, verse 8, "I delight to do your will, O my God.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.000]   Your law is within my heart."
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.360]   So it's right to do God's will and it's right to delight to do God's will.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.040]   But the Bible never makes our delight in doing something the sole criterion for deciding
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.200]   whether that something is right to do.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.560]   That's why Jesus said, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.440]   his cross and follow me."
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.440]   Matthew 16.24.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.940]   Until the day that we are perfected in the presence of Christ, there will be aspects
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:42.800]   of our desires that have to be denied in order to be faithful followers of Jesus.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:52.960]   The life of obedience to Jesus will never be a life only doing what we love to do.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   There will always be some measure of denying ourselves.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:07.680]   The world is too harsh, pain is too real, and we are too sinful to think otherwise.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.660]   But it is just as wrong to think that all our natural gifting and all our natural passions
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.620]   should be stifled or will be stifled in the path of obedience.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:31.600]   To use the words of Josh's question that he asked, it is possible to be "obedient
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.240]   with the gifts and passions God has given us."
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.000]   That's Josh's words, and that's right.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.520]   It is possible.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.780]   Some dimensions of those gifts and passions may need to be denied.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.960]   Some dimensions of those gifts and passions may need to be reoriented and transformed
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.840]   from man-centered pursuits to radically God-centered pursuits.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.240]   There's the heart of the matter, isn't it?
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.280]   There's the key.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:11.080]   Are my dreams and my passions and my gifting, are they all being transformed by a radically
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.440]   God-centered, Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated vision of reality?
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.800]   In other words, the key to living a life that is pleasing to God and fruitful for man is
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.560]   not to think you can calculate from your dreams or calculate from your gifting or calculate
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:37.160]   from your passions what precise path will be most fruitful for people and most faithful
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   to God.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.520]   I don't think such calculation is possible for finite human beings.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.240]   Only God can calculate things like that because God can work miracles through us in paths
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.760]   and in places we thought would be utterly pointless and fruitless.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.040]   And bam, God works a miracle and they become tremendously fruitful.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:08.820]   Instead of that kind of calculation, I think we should pour our energy into becoming radically
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:16.880]   God-centered people, radically Christ-exalting people, radically Bible-saturated people,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   radically loving people, radically risk-taking, servant-like people.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:32.000]   In other words, the lion's share of our efforts in life should be to become a kind
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.200]   of person.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:44.600]   Even in ways that to me appear increasingly mysterious, God guides his people, his radically
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.440]   crazy God-entranced, Christ-treasuring, Bible-permeated people.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:08:00.200]   He guides us into some of the most surprising vocational pathways that we can imagine.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   It's a great mystery to me how he does that so differently for so many different faithful
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.240]   Christians.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:16.280]   Sometimes just hearing the passions and the ambitions of God-centered people stir us up
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.920]   to make changes in our lives that are mind-boggling.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:30.120]   So let me close by having Paul tell us about his dreams and ambitions from the Bible.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.340]   Listen to Paul.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.680]   This is Acts 20.24.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:41.580]   I do not count my life of any value or as precious to myself, if only I may finish my
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:48.120]   course and the ministry I receive from the Lord Jesus to testify to the gospel of the
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.560]   grace of God.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.480]   Romans 15.19.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:59.280]   I make it my ambition to preach the gospel not where Christ has already been named.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.080]   Philippians 1.20.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:09.120]   It is my eager expectation and hope that Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.160]   or by death, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.080]   Philippians 3.13.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.680]   One thing I do, forgetting what lies behind, straining forward to what lies ahead, I press
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.760]   on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:42.680]   So my answer to Josh is, if your dreams become as drenched with gospel zeal and your gifts
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:51.560]   become as fervently bent toward magnifying Christ and your passions become as thrilled
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:58.560]   with the glory of God as Paul's, yes, you can follow your dream.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.800]   And thanks for the question, Josh.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.660]   If you have a vocation question for Pastor John, send it our way.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.760]   You can do that or research or browse all 1,600 of our past episodes or subscribe to
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   the podcast.

[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.440]   Well in a very different life scenario, on Monday we hear from a woman, a believer, who
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.080]   was arrested for a crime she committed.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.600]   She doesn't deny it.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.760]   She's guilty.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.120]   She's going to court and likely going to prison.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   So what is a believer to do in such a situation when everything in life is crashing down through
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.960]   the fault of one's own sin?
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.320]   Is there any hope?
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.280]   Pastor John will weigh in on Monday, a really important episode.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.200]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke and we'll see you then on the other side of the weekend.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.800]   Thanks for listening.
