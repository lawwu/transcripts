[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Hello again, and thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John with longtime author and pastor
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.480]   John Piper.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.800]   As you can imagine, we get a lot of questions about what it means to live as a child of
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.800]   God.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.040]   We go from being a rebel against the king to becoming a child of the king.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.520]   So how does God's disposition toward us change in the process?
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.120]   And specifically, is God angry at His children when they sin?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.200]   It's a question from a listener named Kathleen.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.640]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.080]   As a born-again believer, is God still angry at me when I sin?
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.480]   I believe God's wrath is real, and I have embraced Christ's propitiation for my sins,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.400]   but I struggle to understand the differences between God's wrath and anger over my sin
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.520]   before and after my justification.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   I personally hate my own sin and want to be done with it all, but for now, does Christ's
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.360]   death for my sins and subsequent propitiation mean that God is never angry at me when I
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.000]   sin or just that His final wrath on me was satisfied?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.760]   What is God's affectional disposition toward me in Christ when I stumble and sin in my
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.560]   life right now?"
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:23.620]   It might be possible to put in a sentence or two the complex affectional disposition
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:32.840]   of God toward His children in this age, but it seems to me that such effort to do is less
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.800]   than what the Scriptures actually do when we read them regarding God's disposition
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.640]   toward us.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.640]   It gives some help to try to synthesize those words.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.120]   I do this all the time.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.800]   That's what preaching and theology is, is the effort to make sense out of all the passages
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   of the Bible.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.020]   But when it comes down to it, early in the morning, late at night, when we need some
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.360]   word of truth and firmness and helpfulness and encouragement, it isn't so much the
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:18.560]   syntheses that have power in our lives, but the very words of God Himself in Scripture.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.720]   So let me do both, but really put the emphasis on the Scriptures.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.760]   Let me say just a short word of synthesis and then refer, Kathleen, to the very specific
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.040]   passages of Scripture.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.960]   Here's my synthesis.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:49.800]   God's punitive—that is, punishing or condemning—anger is completely absorbed by Jesus when He died.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.240]   He became a curse for us.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.200]   He bore our sin.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:04.680]   But God may still be angry and displeased and grieved toward His loved children in a
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.000]   disciplinary sense rather than a condemning sense.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.640]   Or let's put it positively.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.160]   Whereas before we were believers, we could not please God—Hebrews 11:6, "Without
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640]   faith you can't please God."
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.480]   Before we could not please God, but were by nature children of wrath.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.120]   Now that we are believers, we do please God, and He feels great delight in us as His children.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.360]   So that's my synthesis of what I see.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.800]   So let me turn to specific Scriptures so that these can just sink in.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.120]   Let's start with the fundamental truth that God is a very happy God in providing gospel
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.720]   hope to sinners.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.520]   First Timothy 1:11, Paul refers to the gospel of the glory of the blessed or happy God.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:16.320]   We just have to be sure that we rid our minds, we just get rid of a gloomy picture of God
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:25.840]   whose Son somehow finagled a way for us to sneak into heaven and stay out of His way,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.480]   just to slap us around like maybe our Father did.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.640]   We got to be done with thoughts that God is disinclined to save sinners.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.120]   Luke 15:7, over and over, like four times, "Just so I tell you, there will be more joy
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.280]   in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who have no need
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   of repentance."
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.720]   And we know it's talking about not just angels throwing a party, but God Himself, because
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.000]   in the parable of the prodigal son, that's in fact what He does.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   He runs out, He grabs His son, hugs him, throws a party, and says, "Come on, come on, older
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   son.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   He's home, He's alive."
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   I mean, this Father's just oozing gladness, not begrudging, "Well, I guess I have to
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.120]   save my son who wrecked all my property."
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.560]   It's just not like that.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.440]   So He does hate sin.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:27.760]   I mean, we're not going to gloss over, God hates sin, including mine, my regenerate John
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.840]   Piper sinning.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.240]   God hates sin, not only because it dishonors Him, but because it damages me, it damages
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.040]   us, Christians.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.000]   So Ephesians 4:30 says that we can grieve God with our sin, and 1 Thessalonians 5:19
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.680]   says we can quench His Spirit with our sin.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.240]   And it's plain from 1 Thessalonians 4:1 that some behaviors please God and some behaviors
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.040]   displease God.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.080]   And probably the most important text on feeling the tension and getting it right is Hebrews
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.880]   12, where it says, verse 5, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:22.480]   or be weary when reproved by Him, for the Lord disciplines the one He loves."
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.460]   This is what is hard for us to feel when we're being disciplined, because the discipline
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.880]   here is physical suffering at least.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.900]   It may be other things as well, because He said you haven't yet resisted unto shedding
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.600]   of blood, so we know what kinds of things He's talking about.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.400]   And He chastises every son whom He receives, and the Proverbs says every son He delights
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.160]   in.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.560]   God—I'm still reading now—verse 10, "God disciplines us for our good, that we
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.600]   may share His holiness.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.380]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.440]   the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.400]   Here's what we have to affirm and see texts.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:22.840]   In and through and under all of this grieving and quenching and displeasing and the resultant
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:32.280]   discipline, under, in, through, all of that, we must not lose sight of the following text.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.920]   So let me just read them.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   They're glorious.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   Bathe in these.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:45.720]   Romans 8, 1, "There is now no condemnation, none, for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   That is gone.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   It's over.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.200]   No guilt, no condemnation, no punishment.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   Christ took it all.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.700]   Romans 8, 31, "If God is for us," which He is, 100%, "who can be against us?
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.960]   He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not with Him
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.340]   graciously give us all things?"
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:15.000]   God is bent on giving us everything that is good for us.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.600]   Ephesians 2, 4, "God being rich in mercy because of the great love," that's the only place
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.360]   in the Apostle Paul where that phrase is used, "great love," which He loved, "the great love
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.400]   with which He loved us even when we were dead and in our trespasses made us alive together
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   with Christ."
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.840]   If you're alive in Jesus, which means if your heart is alive to Jesus, loving Jesus, trusting
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.440]   Jesus, He has great love for you, and that's the evidence of it.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.720]   Or Psalm 103, my favorite gospel psalm, I think, "He does not deal with us according
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   to our sins or repay us according to our iniquities.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.300]   As high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His steadfast love towards those
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.440]   who fear Him.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.360]   As far as the east is from the west, so far does He remove our transgressions from us."
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.600]   And here it gets really tender, sweet.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:20.040]   "As a father pities or has compassion on his children, so the Lord pities, has compassion
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.080]   on those who fear Him."
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.560]   Or Zephaniah 317, "The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.120]   He will rejoice over you with gladness.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.400]   He will quiet you by His love.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.560]   He will exalt over you with loud singing."
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.720]   Can you hear God singing?
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.000]   No, you cannot, because you don't have glorified ears yet, and you wouldn't be able to take
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.320]   "He will sing thunderous loud."
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.760]   Luke 12, 32, "Fear not, little flock.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.400]   It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.640]   Oh, I love that verse.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.520]   Your Father, little flock.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.600]   So He's a Father, He's a shepherd, He's a King, and He's not giving us the kingdom merely.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.360]   He's loving to give us the kingdom.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.880]   He's finding good pleasure in giving us the kingdom.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.680]   Or Psalm 147, 10, "His delight is not in the strength of a horse.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:29.920]   His pleasure is not in the legs of a man, but the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.480]   Him, in those who hope in His steadfast love."
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.200]   And the reason I think that's precious is because you might say, "Well, I've got strong
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   legs.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   I can run.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.360]   Why isn't God delighting in my strength?"
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.520]   This text is written for the last hour of your life, man.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.280]   I mean, you're going to have no legs.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.640]   You're going to be lying in a bed.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.120]   You're going to weigh 85 pounds.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.840]   You're going to be in a diaper.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.040]   You're going to be breathing through your mouth, and you're going to be wishing you
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.800]   were dead, and nothing is required of you but hope for Him to delight in you at that
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   moment.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   So that's good news.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.680]   That is really, really good news for helpless people, and all of us are going to be helpless
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.160]   sooner or later.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:15.240]   And the last text, one of my favorite new covenant promises, Jeremiah 32, 40, "I will make with
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.680]   them an everlasting covenant that I will not turn away from doing good to them.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.600]   And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, and they will not turn from me."
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:35.280]   And here it comes, "I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:43.880]   with faithfulness, with all my heart and with all my soul."
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:53.480]   Maybe one last summary word that might help put God's displeasure with our sinning together
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.280]   with His delight in us as His children.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:06.320]   Even though God is displeased when we sin, He never looks on us with contempt.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:15.200]   I remember talking to a woman some time ago who was struggling with feeling the affections
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:22.840]   of God because of a sense of continual disapproval, and when I introduced the distinction between
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:29.560]   the disapproval of the behavior of one you love and contempt for one you find disgust
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:37.080]   in, she felt something run off, something clicked in her mind, and maybe this would
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.880]   help you as well.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:48.880]   He never looks upon us with contempt because He's always for us, never against us.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:58.120]   He will always restore us and bring us unfailingly to an eternity when there will be no grieving
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.500]   Him, no quenching Him, no displeasing Him anymore.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.520]   Really good, so precious.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.720]   Last week I was reading an old Puritan book on fellowship with the person of the Spirit,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   and there the author made the point that an enemy can be slighted, but only a friend can
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   be grieved.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.300]   That's good, that's good.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.300]   Only a friend can be grieved.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.300]   That's really good.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.300]   So good.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.300]   Similar to what you said.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.080]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those very helpful words, and thank you for listening to listen
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.360]   to our past episodes or send us a question of your own.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:34.520]   Go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.080]   Friday we return to address the important question over whether or not God created all
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.840]   of His creation because He needed it.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:47.480]   If He couldn't have displayed His glory without creation, does that make Him dependent on
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.280]   what He has made?
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.720]   And of course that is problematic if that's true, God in need of creation.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.640]   It's a tricky and weighty question.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.760]   It's up on Friday for Pastor John.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.260]   We'll see you then.
