[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Do you view soda as one of the worst, certainly not the best, but one of the worst culprits
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   out there?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.520]   I mean it is really prominent, especially nowadays also we should include energy drinks.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.080]   A lot of kids, especially males, by the way, it's almost, this is crazy, it's almost 95%
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.600]   of energy drink consumption is males.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.600]   Interesting.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.560]   And I don't know what is, maybe it's the packaging or how the marketing has been pitched.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.640]   But by the way, as soon as I say that, someone will be in the YouTube comments telling me
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.920]   that that's completely false, but we can point you to the data.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.200]   So what are your thoughts on sugary drinks and what that's doing?
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.220]   How it's, do you think this is a reaction to how much stress people are experiencing?
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.760]   Is this like people's attempt to inoculate their stress or is it simply that it tastes
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.660]   good and it's easy to consume and it's relatively inexpensive?
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.400]   People have not, and we have not really studied the sugary drinks in the same way we have
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.440]   studied the comfort food and the binge eating.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.080]   And so my guess is that it is part of a stress response, but even more than that, it's part
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.180]   of the hedonic cycle.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.240]   So when you get the sugar, especially if it's packed with caffeine, that's going to be a
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.920]   more addictive drink, you get this, you know, really feel good response right away.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.560]   And then you get the low and it's the hedonic withdrawal, so which is this, you actually
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.020]   feel bad when it's been a while since you've had it.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.280]   And so then it drives the compulsivity.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.040]   You want it again because you want to, not because you want to feel good, you want to
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.680]   get rid of feeling bad.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.120]   So that's what happens with both food addiction and we think that happens with sugary drinks.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   Now let me tell you that when you asked is a sugary drink one of the worst things we
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.040]   can do for our health, yes, because sugary food doesn't go to our brain as quickly as
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.840]   a liquid sugar, a sugary drink.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.400]   So think about cocaine and crack, crack goes to the brain immediately and it's that much
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.880]   more addictive.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.040]   That's how we think of liquid sugar.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   The view on sugar I think is starting to change.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.360]   And I think in the years to come, provided folks like you and Dr. Lustig continue to
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.120]   be vocal about it, which I hope you will, I think it's going to shift things quite a
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   bit.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.600]   I look at it a little bit like trans fats.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.040]   You know, when I was growing up, people ate margarine and now like trans fats are banned
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.040]   in many cities.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   It's kind of incredible how these things have changed over time and it requires an effort
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.520]   not just on social media but podcasts and I think also lobbying, lobbying our politicians,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.680]   really getting them to understand just how pernicious this stuff is.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.040]   There's a lot of social norms that go into like what's good for all of us as a group
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.440]   or community and what's personal choice.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   It's very fiery.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.060]   You know, I've heard a colleague talking about how bringing junk food or soda to work is
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.440]   like passive smoking.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.640]   You're bringing something in that's going to pollute other people's health and you shouldn't
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.640]   do it.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.320]   So that's much more edgy and people will fight them on that.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.640]   But the basic reality is, yeah, we're going to eat the donuts if they're in front of us.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.200]   And so, it is much more considerate to bring a bowl of fruit.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.920]   I do love a good donut every once in a while.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   Oh, me too.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   That's my weakness.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.080]   I'm glad you brought up smoking.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   I don't want to take us off topic but as long as we're venturing into these general or I
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.680]   should say more general and yet really important themes around public health and food, yes,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.320]   I learned something interesting about smoking and why so few people now smoke.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.000]   I always thought that the campaigns around smoking and how terrible it is for us showing
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   pictures of lungs that are, you know, caked with all this tar and like, you know, cancer
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.980]   and all this stuff was the effective message.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.600]   But what I learned was that one of the most effective messaging systems in the battle
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.720]   against smoking was to get young people to stop smoking, not by telling them it was bad
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:15.040]   for them, but by showing them videos of these rich men sitting around tables cackling about
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.880]   the fact that they're making so much money on the health problems of other people because
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   of smoking.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.080]   In other words, what they did is they made being a non-smoker anti-establishment.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.560]   And so, I find it very interesting anytime there's something like soda or highly processed
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.840]   foods that are so woven into the establishment, it seems like we can tell people until, you
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.200]   know, we're blue in the face about all the health concerns with these things, you know,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.960]   sugar is bad and this is bad, highly processed food is bad.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.480]   Some people might change their behavior, but it seems like for the younger generation,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   the thing that's most effective is to activate their sense of rebellion.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   This has been true for probably hundreds of thousands of years, but it's certainly true
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.120]   in the last hundred years.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.680]   And let them see that there is a very strong big food, sometimes big pharma, but certainly
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.720]   big food system that is working against them.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.580]   And that in order to take control of their health, actually we want to activate their
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.360]   sense of rebellion so that they're like, "No, I'm going to take excellent care of myself.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.800]   I'm not going to fall victim to this monetary scheme."
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.280]   And here, I'm not pointing to any conspiracy.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.840]   I mean, this has been seen with smoking, this has been seen with a number of different pharmaceuticals.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.240]   Again, not all pharmaceuticals are bad.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.600]   This is true of a number of different aspects of kind of big marketing.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   Absolutely.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.680]   Pull the blinders off, let people know that we're vulnerable to all the marketing and
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.400]   that there really are suppression of data behind a lot of it.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.520]   So it's happening with eating disorders too.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.400]   Eric Stice, who's at Stanford with you, has been using this method, we call it dissonance,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.680]   showing people with eating disorders how the food industry has been manipulative and has
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.620]   tried to design foods for addiction, for the highest bang for the buck with dopamine, etc.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.760]   And so that has helped reduce eating disorders in these studies and it has even helped reduce
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.960]   reward drive.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.560]   Isn't that amazing that the dissonance could do that?
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   So interesting.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.320]   Yeah, I think what it's telling us is that few things are as strong as the, "No, I won't.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.980]   I refuse to," response in terms of changing behavior, especially when there's something
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.200]   to push against.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.560]   So it's not just a battle with ourselves, "I want the soda, but I'm not going to drink
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   it."
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.920]   It becomes a, "Well, I want it, but I want it because you are making me think I want
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   it.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   I don't actually want that."
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.400]   So I don't know, maybe this is getting me back into my teenage mindset.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.600]   But I think a sense of rebellion, provided it's in the direction of health, one's own
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.040]   health and the health of others, of course, can be a positive thing.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.040]   Well, we do that with the mindful eating.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   We have them bring in the junkiest processed food they can think of, like a Twinkie, and
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.240]   eat that really slowly and mindfully.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.200]   And few people finish it and are like, "That actually wasn't nearly as good as the picture
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.040]   of it and the idea of it."
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.720]   And so it's like that reward predictive error that you've talked about where they think
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.400]   the brain is driving them to have it because of the advertising and their expectation that
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.480]   they'll feel good.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.120]   But if they're really paying attention, it's a very disappointing experience, versus we
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.960]   also have people savor a piece of good chocolate, whichever they like, milk or dark.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:32.160]   And that experience teaches them to eat slowly and really enjoy small amounts of rewarding
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.560]   food so that they don't need to feel full and binge.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:43.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
