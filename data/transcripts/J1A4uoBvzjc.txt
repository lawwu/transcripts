[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.740]   Eric Olson from Springfield, Missouri writes in, "Pastor John, does the popularized pay-it-forward
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.560]   concept nullify grace?
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.560]   I just read a segment of your book, Future Grace, and I think it clarified why I've been
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.600]   discontented with all of this paying it forward.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.760]   It seems too easily to fall into the camp of human obedience to match past grace or
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.520]   the idea of giving to get.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.600]   Can you show a scripture that might reveal our motives in the pay-it-forward phenomenon
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.600]   that we see today?"
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.160]   Let me give a little background first because my guess is some of our listeners are not
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.560]   familiar with this at all.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.640]   I certainly was not aware of the phenomenon he's talking about, so I had to do a little
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   poking around.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.920]   So pay it forward is an expression for describing the beneficiary of a good deed, repaying it
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.640]   to others instead of the one who did the good deed to him.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.160]   So the concept is very old, but the phrase may have been coined, according to Wikipedia,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:19.240]   by Lily Hardy Hammond in 1916 in her book, The Garden of Delight.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.880]   There was a movie in 2000 called Pay It Forward, and the lead line in the movie was, "When
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.680]   someone does you a good deed, don't pay it back, pay it forward."
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   That's the idea.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.600]   There's a pay-it-forward foundation, there's a pay-it-forward novel, there's a pay-it-forward
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.160]   day, April 30th, maybe that's why the question came recently.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.120]   Benjamin Franklin loaned a man in need some money one time, and he said, "I do not pretend
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.200]   to give such a deed.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.520]   I only lend it to you.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.640]   When you meet with another honest man in similar distress as you, you must pay me by lending
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.960]   this sum to him."
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   That's the meaning of pay it forward.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.640]   So the gist of it then, pretty plain, and I would say in advance of my biblical reflection,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.000]   that on the horizontal level, as a way of thinking about spreading kindness, it seems
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.720]   pretty harmless to me and could do much good.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.680]   But we're Christians, and we don't live merely on the horizontal level ever.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.920]   We're always dealing with two directions, the horizontal and the vertical.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.660]   We live before the face of God.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.760]   So what does this mean in Scripture?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.920]   What does the Scripture have to say about this approach towards ethics?
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.120]   Discharging a debt from one person toward giving back not to that person, but giving
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   forward to another person.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.720]   What does the Bible say about that?
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.960]   And I think the best way to handle this is to just get a big picture of the biblical
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.920]   view of debt or obligation in its various forms.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.440]   One of them is a pay it forward in the Bible, but others are not.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.200]   So here's my definition of debt.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:26.400]   Debt is an obligation or a sense of ought in me to do some good for someone which is
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.480]   created, the debt is created by someone doing a good for me.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.800]   Okay, I said it very generally because that way it's going to cut across all kinds of
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.400]   lines and I've got what, I think five or four.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.320]   Yeah, see, I think I have five ways that we legitimately come into debt.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   So number one, someone loans you something or invest something with you, you are indebted
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.920]   to pay them back.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.720]   So parable of the talents, Jesus said, Matthew 25, to the fellow who didn't do anything
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.920]   with his talent that the master had loaned him, "Then you ought to have invested the
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.480]   money with bankers and at my coming I should have received back that which I gave you with
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   interest."
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.640]   So that man was indebted to the investor.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.240]   He gives you money to handle for his sake, it's his money.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.200]   You owe him that money with interest or some kind of payoff because he gave it to you to
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.520]   handle.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.080]   That's number one.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.040]   Number two, you put in a day's work, your employer owes you a wage.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.480]   First Timothy 5, 18, "Do not muzzle an ox when it's treading out the grain.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.400]   The laborer deserves his wages."
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.560]   So it's right if you're an employer to feel indebted to pay a wage to your employees.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.320]   Number three, we are debtors to others if they have given us spiritual blessings.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.480]   Romans 15, 26, "Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.880]   the poor, the saints in Jerusalem, for they were pleased to do it and indeed they owe,"
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.760]   there's the key word, "they owe it to them."
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.560]   Or if they, the Gentiles, the Macedonian Gentiles, have come to share in the spiritual blessings
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.240]   that came from Jerusalem, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.120]   They ought, you hear the word "ought"?
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.920]   So they owe it to them, they ought.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.360]   So when spiritual blessings come to you from someone, there is a sense of oughtness that
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.040]   you should participate in meeting any needs they have, even physically.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.560]   First Corinthians 9, 11, "If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.520]   if we reap material things from you?"
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.800]   No, if we've sown, we should reap from you.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.120]   Or Galatians 6, 6, "Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   who teaches."
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.920]   So teachers should be supported by the ones they're teaching.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.420]   So there's that kind of oughtness created by the sharing of spiritual things.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.320]   Number four, "We are debtors to all people."
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.640]   Here's the pay-forward part.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:20.320]   "We are debtors to all people if God has given us a gift which he is willing to give to all
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.360]   who call upon him through you."
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.640]   So here's Paul in Romans 1, 14, "I am a debtor to Greeks and barbarians, both to the
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.680]   wise and to the foolish."
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.600]   In other words, I'm a debtor to everybody.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.440]   "So I am eager to preach the gospel also to you who were in Rome."
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.640]   So what he means by that is, God has given me, has entrusted me with this spectacular
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:55.440]   treasure of the gospel, and therefore I am a debtor to everyone because the gospel is
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.240]   meant for everyone and I have it.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.520]   Here's a picture of this.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.560]   Back in 1975, Dan Fuller preached at my ordination, and he did it from this text, and he made
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.000]   this point.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.740]   The text is 2 Kings 7, "The Syrians have surrounded Jerusalem.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.520]   The embargo is such that they are starving in Jerusalem.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.220]   Nobody can get any food.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:29.140]   They're about to all perish from starvation, and God steps in and chases the Syrians away
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.840]   by causing them to hear something.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.800]   There are four lepers standing at the gate who decide, 'Look, we're going to die anyway.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.140]   Let's go ask for mercy from the Syrians.'
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.400]   So they go out to the Syrian camp, and it's empty, filled with food.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.660]   This is like the gospel.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.400]   This is like finding the gospel, the treasure hidden in a field.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   And what do they do?
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.660]   Well, they start eating, they pounce upon it and eat it and amass it, and then they
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.780]   stop and in verse 9 it says, "They said to one another, 'We're not doing right.'"
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.540]   In other words, we have a debt here.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.140]   We have a debt.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.940]   We're not doing right.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.580]   This day is a day of good news.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:20.500]   If we are silent and wait until morning, punishment will overtake us.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.920]   Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king's household.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.580]   And within a day, everybody's need was met in Jerusalem.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:37.740]   So the point there is, when you are made the beneficiary from God of something that is
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:44.500]   meant to benefit everyone, you are the debtor to everyone.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.400]   That's biblical paying it forward.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.000]   And the last one is, and this is the one he picked up on in "Future Grace," and it's
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.380]   really crucial, so we need to end on this.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.600]   We have a debt to God for all his goodness to us.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.260]   Yes, we do.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.320]   We owe God.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.060]   But this debt is absolutely unique.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.780]   It can never be repaid.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.260]   It should never be repaid.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.720]   Any attempt to repay it is a contradiction of grace.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.620]   We will go deeper and deeper into debt forever.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.480]   We will never come out of debt to God, and grace means that.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.700]   Grace would not be grace if you could pay it back.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:34.380]   God would not be all-sufficient if his gift to us reduced his resources so that they needed
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.660]   replenishing by payback.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.660]   They're not reduced.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.900]   That's what it means to be infinite.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.100]   That's what it means to be God.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.900]   When God gives, he is the no less for it.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.380]   When we give, we are the less for it in some way.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.380]   He's not.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.020]   We dishonor God by trying to pay God back for his good towards us.
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:01.500]   So when Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15.10, "By the grace of God, I am what I am, and
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.460]   his grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.200]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.320]   It was not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:17.200]   What that verse means is any attempt we make, that is any good deed we perform, is performed
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.680]   by the grace of God so that our good deeds can never be a means of paying back for grace
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.520]   because they are expressions of grace and therefore take us in deeper into grace.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.320]   So a person is profoundly confused if they think that good deeds, inobedience to God
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.600]   is a payback to God when Paul says those good deeds are a very work of grace, not the payback
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.800]   for grace.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.400]   And the last thing would be Psalm 116.12, "What shall I render to the Lord for all
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.800]   of his benefits to me?"
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.760]   Okay, there is the key payback question in relation to God.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.160]   What shall I render to the Lord for all of his benefits to me?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:04.760]   And his answer is in verse 13, Psalm 116, "I will lift up the cup of salvation."
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.420]   Now at that point you wonder, "What does that mean?
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.480]   Is this a cup that is full and he's toasting God?"
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.960]   Like it's a toast, I lift it up and toast him, or is it a cup that is empty and he's
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.640]   asking for more?
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.480]   And the next phrase answers the question.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.960]   "I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord."
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.000]   So the answer of payback to God is ask for more.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.840]   If you want to honor God for yesterday's grace, ask him for today's grace.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.800]   Because in doing that, you're showing your desperate need and you're showing God's
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.680]   infinite resourcefulness.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:57.880]   So if you pay forward the way Paul pays forward in Romans 1.14, know this, you are not paying
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   God back by paying forward to others.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.840]   You are drawing down more and more and more grace and laying up more and more treasure
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   in heaven.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   Amen.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
