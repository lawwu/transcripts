[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam and Sydney from the Financial Samurai podcast. Happy holidays.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.520]   In this final episode of 2023, we just wanted to recap some of our favorite episodes, highlight
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.880]   what we've been doing, some wins and losses, as well as understanding extrinsic versus
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.600]   intrinsic motivators. So how are you feeling, Sydney, about the year?
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.360]   I'm feeling okay. Usually around this time of year, I feel a little bit better, but I
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.220]   feel that this year was kind of tough in the first half for myself at least, but it's picked
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.520]   up a lot in the end of third quarter and fourth quarter. So I'm feeling a lot better now definitely
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.240]   than I was in the first half of the year. Tired though with the holidays, it's a lot.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.680]   How about you? How are you feeling?
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.520]   I am absolutely exhausted. I haven't felt this exhausted since my banking days. We recorded
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.520]   65 episodes in 2023, so that is more than one a week, and that is 35 episodes more than
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.600]   our goal. And I think part of that was because I finally learned how to use this podcast
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.460]   software to interview other people. So the whole world opened up and it was really fun
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.400]   to interview other people. However, every single episode takes hours and hours to record,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.720]   to edit, to produce, and that really kind of took a lot out of me. Also, I published
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.920]   156 new posts on Financial Samurai, so that's three posts a week. And that's been going
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.180]   on for over 14 years now, and July 2024 will be the 15th anniversary of Financial Samurai.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.180]   So I'm exhausted.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.180]   Exhausted for sure. That's a lot that you've done, not just this year, but in the whole
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.980]   course of Financial Samurai.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.560]   And it's just – actually, if I only wrote and recorded podcasts, I would be totally
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.160]   fine. But of course, as you know, we have two little ones and they take a lot of time,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.200]   a lot of patience, a lot of love. And that really – it's one of those things where
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.240]   it's not so much the cost of kids, it's actually the time it takes to raise kids and
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.480]   the energy required because you have to be present. And one of the things that I found
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.120]   out most was one of my goals for this year was to teach our son to swim. And then he
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.960]   finally swam after we took off his floaties this summer. And if you want to learn how
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.120]   to be present, you should teach your children how to swim. It will teach you presence. It
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.280]   will teach you focus. It will teach you patience because you can't look away. You can't
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.880]   look away for more than two seconds, I would say. Otherwise, anything could happen and
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.920]   bad things could happen when it comes to swimming.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.880]   Yeah. I totally feel you. I didn't do much time in the water with the kids this year,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.080]   but I was in the water some and yeah, it's a lot. Just taking care of kids in general
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.800]   takes a lot of energy. It's rewarding, no doubt, but it also takes a lot of energy and
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   focus.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.160]   Yeah, absolutely. So out of the 65 episodes, Sydney, what were some of your favorites?
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.440]   First one that comes to mind was the Shawn Livingston episode that you did. I really
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.560]   enjoyed that dialogue. I also loved the Mike Katchmark episode. That was one of the crown
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:48.360]   jewels I think of the whole year. Amazing insights into such a huge lawsuit. I really
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.720]   am looking forward to seeing how the real estate industry is going to change for the
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.220]   better for consumers. I also really enjoyed the Charlie Albright episode. Between the
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.720]   ones that we did, I liked the full benefit episode that we did. Then the discussions
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.000]   that we had about deciding whether or not we should buy a home. I thought those were
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.520]   some great conversations that we had. How about your favorites?
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.060]   Yeah, I definitely loved talking to Shawn Livingston, four-time NBA champ. It's just
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.320]   amazing that someone was able to win not once, but four times, three as a player, one as
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.260]   an executive. I mean, talk about an amazing, amazing ride from knee injury during his initial
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.560]   years to lasting 15 years in the NBA. The average NBA career is only four and a half
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.640]   years and most people don't win championships. One of the key things that Shawn taught me
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.840]   to be great, to be successful, is to keep showing up and do the things you have to do
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.880]   even when you don't want to do them. That really resonated with me this year because
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.800]   I would have to admit many times on a Saturday night or a Saturday morning, I didn't want
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.680]   to write the newsletter for Sunday morning because I was tired. I was thinking, "Come
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.920]   on, it's Saturday. Why can't I just relax and spend time with the kids or just veg out
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.600]   a little bit?" But I kept showing up and I wrote. As I wrote, it's a muscle. You just
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.240]   keep on getting better. But to be honest, sometimes I just didn't want to do it. Thank
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   you, Shawn, for coming on the Financial Samurai Podcast. I also like Mike Ketchmark, who is
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.200]   the trial attorney who found the real estate industry or the National Association of Realtors,
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.880]   Keller Williams and some other brokerage guilty of collusion. If you think about it, over
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.400]   the past 20 years, commission rates in almost every single industry has declined and is
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.160]   close to zero except for the real estate industry. Why is that? Well, there's this powerful lobbying
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.120]   group out there and this powerful system out there that keeps commissions high.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.600]   I also liked Jamie Fiori Higgins. She was a managing director at Goldman Sachs. I think
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.320]   she started a year before me, same at One York Plaza, and she was able to get to MD.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.000]   She described her journey and told amazing stories in a wonderful book called Bully Markets,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.560]   which I highly recommend anybody read over the winter break, summer vacation, spring
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   break. It's so entertaining. It's so fun. I really enjoyed that conversation.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.240]   Those were my three favorites.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:38.760]   Yes. Some amazing, amazing conversations you've had throughout the year and wonderful highlights.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.480]   Looking back on the year, what were some of your top wins and losses?
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.320]   One of the wins, financially speaking, was that the stock market did better than expected.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.840]   I was like 40% chance we'd be up 10%, which means 60% chance we'd be not up 10%. Maybe
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.720]   23% chance we'd be down again. The S&P 500 closed up 24%, which is huge. Given we have
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.840]   about 30% of our net worth in the S&P 500 mostly, that was a positive.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.280]   Now on the negative, real estate, I expected an 8% decline in real estate prices, median
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.880]   real estate prices. It looks like that's what happened according to the St. Louis Fed data.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.280]   But if you look at other median home price data, like the Case-Shiller and other indices
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.020]   like the Freddie Mac Index, it shows prices were up 3% to 4%. It just depends on where
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:44.000]   you look. But here, at least in San Francisco, prices were down, probably mid-single digits,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.440]   which was fine. Our real estate portfolio probably declined by about 5%, but we mostly
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.680]   own single-family homes with great ocean views, so they outperformed, I would say.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.800]   So financially speaking, I thought we were going to see a 3.5%, maybe 4% decline in net
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.940]   worth, where we saw an 8.5% increase in net worth. So that was an upside surprise.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:13.480]   Another win was being able to teach our son how to swim. That was just awesome to see,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:20.400]   and now he's swimming down 10 feet and grabbing plastic octopuses and fishies and rockets.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.640]   It's really cool to see. And so I was really, really gung-ho about that. So I said, "Hey,
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.400]   why not teach our daughter to swim?" And at 3.5%, she flung off her floaties and she started
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.440]   to swim as well. So it's been great. Those are kind of things that stick out most to
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.000]   me. How about you?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.120]   First thing that pops into my mind was getting my passport replaced and getting my mom to
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.160]   Japan and home safely. I had a lot of work to do before that to prepare for this trip
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.520]   because I'm helping her with some family matters that we need to square away. So the trip was
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.960]   successful. That was a huge win.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.520]   I also learned how to edit podcasts, which wasn't something that I had planned to do
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.840]   when I started the year, but it's actually been a really helpful skill. So for those
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.120]   of you who are listening, there's a good chance that I had to edit out a bunch of pauses or
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:25.200]   ums or sounds in the background. And it's been a really fun learning experience that
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.320]   I think has hopefully improved your listening experience.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.800]   And another thing is we started to dive into your upcoming second book. We did a lot of
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:44.000]   brainstorming, putting together the ideas for each of the chapters, and I helped with
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.120]   getting a lot of research prepared. So I'm really excited about where that's going into
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   2024.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.200]   That's right. We are writing another book. And that's actually one of the reasons why
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.880]   I felt more tired and stressed in 2023 because writing a book takes a lot of work. Some people
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.720]   write books full time for a living, especially with these type of contracts and this type
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.280]   of commitment to Portfolio Penguin, which is one of the top publishers, nonfiction publishers
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.520]   in the world.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.160]   So taking on that challenge was tough. So it's not just one book deal. It's a two book
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.240]   deal after Buy This, Not That.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.760]   And then speaking of Buy This, Not That, it's so funny because the book went on to be a
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.040]   Wall Street Journal bestseller. And I was contacted by a reporter from the Wall Street
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.760]   Journal who asked me about my interest in collecting books. And if you don't know this,
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.960]   I collect books. I collect rare Chinese art, coins, baseball cards. I collect anything
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.400]   there is in existence. I don't know. I've done that since I was a kid. I don't know
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.840]   if you remember like Cabbage Patch Kids and all that. I would have collected that too,
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.680]   but I didn't have money back then.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.040]   But in terms of collecting books, it's interesting because he asked me, how do you identify books
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.360]   to collect? And I say, well, I look for up and coming or relatively unknown authors.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.400]   And I look for first print editions. And if they're signed, great, because books that
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.320]   are signed during the pandemic, I think are more valuable because there was a throttling
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.120]   down a supply of signed books.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.440]   And so I got to thinking about my book, our book, Buy This, Not That. And it's first edition,
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.960]   first print. And it's interesting, there's typos in it where the editor typed in the
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:37.320]   word debt, as in D-E-P-T instead of D-E-B-T. And he did that several times. I was like,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.440]   oh, what did you guys do that for?
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.400]   But anyway, the funny thing is if there is an error or typo in the first print, it actually
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.760]   makes the books more valuable. So after the Wall Street Journal reporter contacted me
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.600]   and the story will probably come out over the next 30 days, I was like, well, maybe
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:01.280]   I should buy more of my books because they're trading so inexpensively on Amazon at a discount.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.240]   I'll just sign my book and stockpile that supply and then sit on it for 20 years and
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.880]   watch it increase in value potentially, because I also know I'm going to write another book.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:18.760]   And if these subsequent books grow in popularity and become just more famous and all that stuff,
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.680]   the value of that first edition, first print, Buy This, Not That will also go up. So for
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   me, I'm like, oh, $18 to buy my own book? And actually, I can get a discount as an author.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.320]   That might be a good investment for 2024. So sorry for that side note tangent, but I
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.320]   just thought it was interesting.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:43.280]   So yes, book, that is a work in progress, but that also really gave me stress because
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.920]   I had to think about it. And this mental energy to create, it does take a lot of energy. It
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.640]   does take a lot out of me. It's just kind of like when you do a podcast or have a meeting
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.080]   after 30 minutes or an hour, I don't know, for me, sometimes I just want to go take a
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   nap.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.840]   Naps are critical.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.480]   Also I forgot to share some of my fails. One of my goals in 2023 was to see my parents
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.160]   twice. That sounds sad, but they live in Honolulu and I only saw them once. I flew them out
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.200]   in June along with my sister and her boyfriend and it was a great time. Great to see the
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.480]   kids. I have this dream that our kids will get to know their grandparents. It seems like
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:29.960]   a basic dream, but it's surprisingly the hardest thing I've been trying to do for years now.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.760]   And so I've only saw them once, which is not twice. So that's a fail.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.440]   The other failure is I injured my back, lower back twice. The first time was sitting cross-legged
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.280]   on the ground. I was signing books for a Maui fundraiser. I was able to sign 280 books and
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   send them individually to subscribers of the newsletter who donated $65 or more to the
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.560]   Maui Strong Fund or other similar funds to support the Maui victims. And after an hour
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:04.280]   of signing, my back just gave out. I felt this crumbling of my lower vertebrae and I
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.440]   couldn't get up. So I had to call you or I texted you to help me get up and sit on the
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   sofa. You remember that?
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.560]   Yes, I remember that. It was terrifying.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.960]   I couldn't believe it. I mean, I like to sit on the floor. It's just the way I am. But
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.400]   it just gave out. And I think there was like this sadness every single time I was writing
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:32.920]   a note and signing each book about why there was so much devastation. How could this have
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.840]   happened? And so I really believe in the mind-body connection. And one of my favorite books is
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.880]   Dr. Sarno's Healing Back Pain. If you have chronic pain, you got to read that book because
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:49.760]   the mind really can debilitate or uplift the body. I truly believe that.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.440]   And then the second time I injured my lower back was 8.15 p.m. at night in Golden Gate
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.720]   Park. I guess I was only warming up for like five, six minutes playing against these 24
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:06.400]   to 28-year-olds in pickleball. And the very first point, there was a dink, which is called
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.920]   a short drop, and I went to lunge after it. And then I just jammed some nerves in my lower
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:19.480]   vertebrae. And then for 30 hours, I couldn't really move after that either. So it's pretty
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:26.920]   sad, folks. As you age, I think your mind ages slower than your body. Not everyone,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.800]   but at least for me, I feel I'm much more with it than my body. It's starting to fade
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.840]   faster. And so if you don't align your mind and your body correctly, injuries could happen.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.960]   Yeah, it's not fun getting old. Not at all.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:49.920]   It's not at all. So I wanted to conclude by talking about intrinsic versus extrinsic
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:57.960]   motivation. This was a surprise epiphany to me because many people have asked me, how
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:05.400]   do you keep on writing for so long, so consistently? And I tell them I have this intrinsic motivation
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:12.200]   to write because I enjoy the process of writing. I also want to chronicle my life so I can
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.520]   provide some touch points for our children just in case I were to die young. I have this
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:24.720]   not constant, but I have this maybe quarterly reminder that life is short because when I
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.040]   was young, 13 years old, my friend who was 15 years old died in a car accident. And ever
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:36.880]   since that time, I've just thought to myself, wow, I could be gone any minute. So let's
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:43.960]   not waste it. And it's really one of the main reasons why I decided to retire early at 34
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.720]   because I wanted to hedge against an early death. I felt every year I lived after 15
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.400]   years old was a blessing because my friend didn't live past 15. And it's stuck with me
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:01.000]   all this time, ever since I was 13. And so I felt intrinsically motivated to do as much
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.080]   as possible in my work, in my creativity. And that was my answer. And then so one day,
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.880]   I remember this year, I recorded a podcast and I pressed publish. And I took the kids
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.840]   out for three to four hours. And I came back and I asked you, did you listen to the podcast?
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.760]   What do you think? And then you were like, oh, no, I haven't listened to it yet. So truthfully,
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.240]   I was a little bit disappointed. I was like, oh, okay, well, no worries. You're probably
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.160]   busy doing other things. You got a lot of things going on. And then so I thought nothing
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.680]   of it after that. But the next day, I published a new post. And I was out with the kids for
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.760]   two, three hours or whatever it was. And I said, what do you think about the post? And
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:50.480]   you're like, oh, I didn't read it yet. And then at that point, I was disappointed. Because
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.340]   the one person who I want to read my posts and listen to my podcast more than anybody
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.720]   else is you, because you're my partner in crime. You've been my partner in crime since
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.120]   we were in college, and you didn't listen or read. And again, you're a busy person,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:12.360]   you have plenty of things to do. You always eventually read it and listen to the podcast.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:18.160]   But I remember at that point thinking to myself, huh, well, if she's not reading or listening,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.640]   well, why continue? Why bother? Why bother writing three times a week? That's a lot and
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:30.600]   I'm tired. I remember that really clearly. And then I had another realization. And that
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:39.440]   realization was that I had miscategorized what intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.240]   regarding you. So extrinsic motivation generally is like accolades, awards, money, promotions,
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.960]   right? Those are extrinsic motivators. Intrinsic motivators are things like, you know, your
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:59.440]   own self desire, basically, something that drives you. And I had mistakenly categorized
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:07.040]   your affection or your acknowledgement of my work as an intrinsic motivator. But it's
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.800]   really an extrinsic motivator. I just want to feel appreciated by you for the work that
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:19.960]   I do, which helps keep our lifestyle going. And so as soon as I recognized that and moved
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.400]   you from intrinsic to extrinsic, I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I said, you know
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.960]   what? I have to do this because I want to do it. I want to do it because I enjoy creating.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.600]   I enjoy helping others and helping people think about their financial problems and helping
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.280]   solve these financial problems, which I've gone through many a times since 2009. And
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:46.680]   there are always new problems to face with new suboptimal and optimal decisions. And
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.080]   so once I realized that, I was like, ah, okay. And then I kept on going and I didn't quit
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.480]   my cadence. What are your thoughts on extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators?
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:03.200]   I totally hear what you're saying. And when we have any type of misaligned expectations
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.360]   that can lead to disappointment, whereas if we're not expecting acknowledgement, then
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.120]   it doesn't really matter. We just are doing what we need to do or want to do for ourselves.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   No, that's absolutely right. For example, my mother doesn't read basically any of my
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:27.520]   posts. And back in 2009, maybe I would have been disappointed. But now I'm like, oh, that's
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.960]   okay. I'm not writing for her. If she wants to figure out what I'm up to, then she can
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.640]   always pop over to Financial Samurai. But I'm just writing for myself and for the readers
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:42.960]   and producing for the listeners. And that has made me pretty happy overall and pretty
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:51.240]   disciplined in terms of the creation side of things. But what I do realize is that some
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:58.640]   people need a greater kick in the pants than others. And I think everybody realizes that
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.320]   we don't fully appreciate what we have until it's gone. And I am just interested in knowing
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:11.680]   why some people need to be pushed more than others. What kind of self-discipline do you
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:17.060]   have to pursue your passions or the things that you want to do? What are the drivers
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.480]   that make you succeed in the things that you enjoy doing?
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:28.000]   I would say when I was a student and when I was working in a traditional job, I had
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.960]   a lot of high expectations for myself. So I really wanted to make sure that I was doing
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.760]   the best that I could, that I was meeting all of the expectations that were required
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:47.120]   of my job, but going above and beyond that as well. Because I like the feeling of being
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.480]   accomplished and doing things well. And I was very motivated to get promoted when I
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:02.240]   was working in a regular corporate environment. And outside of that, I think motivating factors
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:09.680]   would be doing something that's fun, something that can help other people and earn money
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.240]   in the process. I think all those things are good motivators to work hard and succeed.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   How about you?
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:22.160]   I've always had some internal drive to do the best that I can because I really feel
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:27.720]   icky, feel bad when I don't give it everything I've got and I fail. Because if you've
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:34.480]   given it everything you've got, everything, and you fail, it's okay. You did your best.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.960]   What more can you do? But if you half-ass it, you give 70%, 80%, even just 90% and you
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:47.920]   fail, I personally will always regret not having tried my best. So I don't know where
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:56.960]   this intrinsic motivation comes from, whether it's playing tennis or pickleball or writing.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.120]   It's like Miyagi-san, I don't know, in The Karate Kid, it's like karate do, you've got
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.960]   to do it, don't do it in the middle or otherwise you're going to get squished like a grape.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.360]   Don't do it half-ass. You want to do it as best as you can. Do you have that type of
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:20.520]   guilt in terms of not doing the best that you can or do you feel more like, "Eh, it's
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.360]   okay. Good enough is good enough."
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   I feel like this is a trick question.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.480]   I don't know. I mean, let's just think about it for our children, right? Or the people
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   that we love. How do we instill that self-motivation or is it genetic? It just can't be taught.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:47.200]   You either got to want it yourself or that's it. You can't do it.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.080]   That's a tough question when it comes to kids. I don't know. I do feel that, at least with
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   our kids, they both have this sense of wanting to do things on their own where it's just
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:08.160]   this inner drive of, "Let me do it. I want to do it myself." Between the two of them,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.600]   I definitely see it in her more, but I think both of them want to do well in the things
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.520]   that they like to do.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:21.840]   Right now at age four and six, it's playing with toys or drawing, something like that.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.600]   Something incredibly complicated. I do think they feel proud when they do well at something.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.480]   That's interesting you bring that up because I relate to them. When they make a drawing
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.880]   or do something and they say, "Look, Mommy. Look, Daddy." That's the same thing how I
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:42.080]   feel when I write or I produce an episode. I'm like, "Hey, guys. Did you read it? Did
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.840]   you look at it?" I feel the exact same way. I think all of us crave kind of acknowledgement,
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.400]   especially creators who put themselves out there. They just want to be read, seen, heard,
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.200]   and acknowledged. That's all. We don't want lots of money. We just want to be heard.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   Maybe someone leaves a comment and says, "Hey, good job and here are my thoughts." It's actually
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:08.640]   a really simple dynamics. You put yourself out there, you create, you hope to be recognized.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.680]   I think the answer to my own question is that self-determination is mostly genetic. 70%
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:24.840]   genetic. 30% can be taught. I think what we have to do is teach by example. This summer,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:31.440]   I made our son and daughter do landscaping. We picked up rocks. We bagged weeds, did all
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:39.280]   that. I got down deep and dirty. I hope they saw and appreciate that and remember that
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.160]   so that it's not just me telling them what to do but I'm actually participating with
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:51.640]   my hands and knees as well. I think we can only show and do our best, but I think 70%
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:58.360]   is genetics. The more I see it, it's like no matter what we say or do, we just can't
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:04.720]   change them as much as we want, which is really liberating because then we can just let go
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.520]   and let nature take its course. What do you think about that?
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:15.840]   Yeah, I do think there's only so much that we can do. I definitely will continue to give
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:24.760]   it my all and do my best to turn them into good kids and good adults later on. At some
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:31.800]   point, we have to let go. There's only so much that we can do. They are their own individual
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:38.280]   people who are going to make their own decisions as adults. At that point, there's really not
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:44.040]   much that we can do. I definitely want to give it my all along the way.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.960]   I think that's the other thing. Let's forget about kids. Let's talk about you and me, partners,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:57.280]   friends. We can tell people to do something all day long, but at the end of the day, it's
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.920]   up to them to do it. It's up to you to do it, listeners. I can make suggestions on asset
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.760]   allocation or saving more money or finding side hustles, but at the end of the day, it's
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.040]   up to you to do it. If you want to do it bad enough, you're going to find a way to do it.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.360]   If you don't want to do it bad enough, you're not going to do it. I think long term, everything
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:25.120]   is pretty rational. That is really a great way to let go of any kind of frustrations.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.480]   That's a way that I've been able to cope with some of my frustrations when a reader says,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   "I just can't do it." I'm like, "Okay, well, it's probably because you prefer to do something
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.640]   else."
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:44.000]   That's our little life lesson and epiphanies for 2023. For 2024, I'm excited. I'm always
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.160]   excited in the new year. We plan to release at least a couple episodes a month. Hopefully,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.680]   we'll have some continued good dialogue between you and me. Hopefully, I'll be able to find
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.360]   some other great guests to come on the podcast. Maybe we'll even get some sponsors. Who knows?
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.840]   Each podcast takes several hours to record, edit, and produce. We always appreciate your
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:12.040]   reviews, your shares. It's what keeps us motivated. We really want to thank you for your support
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.120]   in 2023 and in the new year. Thanks so much and happy holidays again.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   Happy new year, everybody.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   Bye-bye.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.000]   Bye-bye.
