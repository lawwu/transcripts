[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.040]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.280]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.280]   My name is Joshua Schietz.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   I'm your host.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.200]   Today, I want to share with you what I think will be the beginning of a fairly lengthy
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.220]   series, or at least I've got lots of these.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.720]   Some of my biggest mistakes, meaning financial mistakes, my biggest financial mistakes.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.640]   And these are not going to be beautifully coordinated.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.400]   They're going to be simply things that as I have reflected on my life, on my successes
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.400]   and failures, I have observed these things to be significant mistakes.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.480]   Today, I'm going to begin with what I consider to be the number one most expensive mistake
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   that I have made.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:01:01.600]   It's quite simply this, I have lived, acted, and thought conservatively.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.560]   Constantly I have lived, acted, and thought conservatively.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.640]   I've been aware of this particular problem for a while, and I want to articulate a few
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.600]   of the examples that I can trace in my own life of how this has hurt me in hopes that
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.600]   you can consider your own life and see what is true or not true.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.080]   And perhaps you're making this mistake.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.720]   By the way, these mistakes, I'm working very diligently to note them and observe them so
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.840]   that I can change them.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.460]   Some of them I have changed successfully.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.420]   Some of them I am changing.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.400]   Some of them I will change.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.520]   But let's begin with conservative thinking.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.720]   Now, in my life, this word conservative has a number of different meanings, a number of
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.120]   different expressions.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.000]   For example, it's quite common that when you hear this word conservative, someone says,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.800]   I'm a conservative.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.520]   Often they're referring to that in a political sense.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.840]   And when I think about being a conservative person, I don't think of it in a political
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.160]   sense, although that does apply.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.040]   And I've spent quite a lot of time over the last few years thinking carefully about my
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.280]   own political conservatism.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   I have a hard time identifying with the political term conservative at the moment.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.520]   While most people would analyze my political opinions and come to the conclusion, oh, Josh
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.080]   was a conservative, I've grown disillusioned with that term, especially when considering
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   the broad scale failure of conservative political thought and conservative political movements
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   in the United States.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.520]   So I'm actually not that unhappy to no longer identify as a conservative, so to speak.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.320]   But in this context, it has nothing to do with politics and it has more to do with,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.420]   I should correct that.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.120]   It has little to do with politics and it has more to do with an outlook on life.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.520]   The basic idea is, hey, bad things can happen and so I should behave prudently.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.600]   I should behave cautiously.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   This is what I think of as conservatism, or at least in the sense that I'm thinking about
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.600]   it right now.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   Is conservatism bad?
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.220]   Well, certainly I would say no.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.240]   There are many things in which I think conservatism is quite warranted.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.880]   I'm personally quite conservative when it comes to things that could kill me.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.080]   And I think that that's smart.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.880]   I think it's smart to be conservative when you're thinking about engaging in an activity
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.520]   that could kill you.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.860]   I'm pretty conservative when I think about things that could lead me down a bad road
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.840]   when I recognize, hey, you know what, I might not be able to recover from that.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   I don't know.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.120]   Best example I think of here is something like drug use.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120]   Right?
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120]   I never use drugs.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.760]   I try not to even use the least of the drugs.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.960]   The drug that I use the most is simply caffeine.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.240]   And I try really hard.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.440]   That's not true.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.440]   I do.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.200]   It's not a matter of trying.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.120]   Once a year or so, once every year or two, I regularly quit caffeine.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.200]   And I take a couple of months with zero caffeine intake because I don't like the idea of being
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.520]   addicted to somebody or something or needing something.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.040]   And so as a matter of personal self-discipline, I discipline myself every year or two to completely
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.840]   stop using any kind of caffeine.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.360]   But I do like that particular drug.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.640]   And so after usually a month or two of proving to myself that I'm not addicted, I'll reintroduce
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.720]   that drug.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.360]   But beyond that, I worry about being the kind of person who uses drugs or uses addictive
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.720]   substances because I think I probably have a bit of addictive personality.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.360]   I don't want to run down that danger.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.800]   Again, I don't think that you have to wholesale reject conservatism.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.400]   But what has hurt me the most financially has been financial conservatism.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.920]   There have been many times in my life where I look back and reflect and there were opportunities
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   in front of me.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.160]   There were big opportunities.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.920]   There were things that had big potential, but those things were risky.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.020]   They were unproven.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.240]   They were speculation.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.360]   They were things that other people might not have been comfortable with.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.240]   And I've often said, "Well, maybe not."
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.160]   But what's also true is when I look at my life and I analyze where my biggest successes
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   have come from, it's almost always come from the times in which I rejected that conservative
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   impulse.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.200]   I rejected those conservative people who were encouraging me to be cautious, to be careful,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.880]   to be conservative, and I acted.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.600]   The single biggest decision that was not identified as a conservative decision that I'm so grateful
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.480]   for was the decision to become an entrepreneur.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.120]   When I was 23 years old, I became an entrepreneur.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.720]   I had gotten laid off from a job that was a safe, conservative, salaried job.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.800]   And instead of going and finding another job, I went and found a business at that time,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.720]   starting in the financial services business.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.880]   I started with no salary.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.480]   I started with no draw.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:18.200]   I started with no promises, just simply the opportunity to work for straight commission.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.640]   And that turned out to be one of the better decisions of my life because it opened up
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.080]   to me a profoundly freeing existence.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.080]   And as I look back, I'm 36 now, as I reflect back over the last 13 years, it's been a dream.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.360]   It's been an absolute dream.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.320]   The next change, next phase in that was when I left that fairly safe work for commission
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.840]   environment, and I embarked upon the world of working on the internet.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.680]   Again, very risky at the time.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.240]   Literally I think my wife and my dad probably were about the only ones that understood why
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.760]   I was doing what I was doing.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.040]   Almost to a man, every other person that I sought advice from said, "No, no, no.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.400]   That's probably not a great solution."
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.360]   Which by the way, reflects more on the people that I was seeking advice from rather than
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.380]   the specific nature of the opportunity.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:21.140]   Point was, I acted in the non-conservative way and I have reaped the joys and the benefits
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.740]   of that time and time again.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.960]   Throughout my life, I can reflect on even smaller decisions.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:35.400]   So many times I have made seemingly quick, rash, aggressive decisions.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.960]   Although not all of them have paid off, I would guess that 80% probably have.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.360]   As I've gotten older, I've come to trust myself much more.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.800]   I've come to trust my impulses.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.320]   I've come to trust my discernment and my judgment far more than I ever did when I was a younger
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.880]   man.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.040]   But even with a track record of success, as I reflect back, I see the roads not taken.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.880]   I see the things I could have done.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:08.360]   I see the opportunities that I had that I skipped past because of a sense of conservatism,
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.920]   because of wanting to be conservative financially.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.560]   And today this bothers me greatly.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.520]   This annoys me.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.760]   And I don't think it was the right decision.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.520]   I don't think it was the right path.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.560]   Thinking about it has helped me to analyze why I made those conservative decisions and
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.240]   then to figure out how, pressing forward, without being foolhardy, I can expose myself
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:45.080]   to more opportunity and to be truly willing to accept the concomitant risk of opportunity.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.600]   The biggest insight that I have gained on this topic simply comes from recognizing that
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.160]   I need to be very careful where I accept advice from.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:01.880]   When I reflect back on my early training and early education in the financial space, what
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:07.400]   I realize now is I chose the wrong training materials.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.240]   And I didn't know the mistake I was making.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.640]   I was ignorant.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.800]   But I chose to listen to the wrong voices.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.200]   I chose to listen to the voices of people who were speaking to people who had different
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.160]   goals than I did.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.360]   A few practical examples.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.000]   One of the earliest financial books that made a big impression on me that I read when I
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.480]   was a teenager was David Bok's book called The Automatic Millionaire.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.440]   Picked this up at a bookstore somewhere.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.400]   I was intrigued by the title.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.680]   Picked it up and I read it.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.520]   And I was so impressed at the plan that Bok laid out in that book.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:51.040]   The basic idea, for those who haven't absorbed that classic of personal finance, was simply
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:59.160]   the idea that if you will automate your finances and you will put aside money on a regular
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.440]   automatic basis, you almost can't help but become rich.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.880]   And Bok was not wrong.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.960]   The advice that he gave in that book was good.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.200]   It was sound.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.580]   He was the one who coined the well-known term, the "Latte Factor."
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:21.480]   The idea being that if you will forgo a daily $5 latte and instead save that money in the
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:28.920]   fullness of time with good investment returns, you can become a multi-millionaire.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:36.060]   That latte factor idea has been much attacked over the years and has become almost a joke.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.900]   But at its core, it's still fundamentally true.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.080]   If you can find small regular expenses that you're willing to do without and instead invest
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.920]   the money that would otherwise be spent on that daily latte or whatever equivalent is
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.640]   in your life, you'll become a millionaire.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.100]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.280]   But what I got wrong was where to focus my time and attention.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.900]   What I got wrong was where to invest my money.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:08.200]   In that same book, Bok presented a fairly mainstream approach to investing.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.500]   The mainstream approach to investing of open a retirement account, put in that retirement
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.400]   account some mutual funds and do this over a period of time.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.480]   Today, with the benefit of hindsight and professional insight, I can understand why Bok gave those
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480]   examples.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.360]   Number one, they're accessible to most people.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.860]   But more importantly, it came out of Bok's own personal formation, out of his own personal
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.860]   professional training.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.560]   I believe he worked for Merrill Lynch.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.360]   And that's the classic model of professional US American finance.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.560]   The idea is you work with people who have an income, who have a job, and you teach those
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.600]   people to put money aside using retirement accounts and to put the money into mutual
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   funds.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.680]   And the finance industry in the United States has done an incredible job of convincing people
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.960]   that really the only safe, successful way to invest money is to invest it into mutual
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.400]   funds.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.040]   Bok's not wrong, but his advice was not right for me.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.460]   And today, looking at it, you'll observe that often, for example, when I do a Q&A show and
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.200]   I speak to a young man who calls me, I'll talk to that young man about opportunity,
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.360]   not about safety and security.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.500]   I'll talk to the man about going forward and building something big and taking risks and
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.880]   being aggressive, not about setting money aside.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:36.240]   The basic error that I see is the modern US financial system is a system that is constructed
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.800]   meaning professional financial advice is a system that is constructed to help rich people
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.640]   stay rich.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:49.720]   It's not a system that is effective at helping poor people become rich.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.240]   It's not that it can't work.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.280]   It can work if you'll simply insert 30 or 40 years.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.160]   But most of us don't want to wait 30 or 40 years to become rich.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.080]   Most of us want to get rich far quicker so that we can enjoy the benefits of wealth at
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.920]   an earlier age.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.080]   Now when we outline this using clear words, it's obvious.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:17.080]   If you ask most wealthy people if they would rather have a million dollars by age 30 or
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.720]   four million dollars by age 60, I think most people would choose the million dollars at
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.080]   age 30, knowing the lifestyle of freedom that can be purchased with a simple million dollar
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   net worth.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.480]   But at the time, I didn't understand that missing piece of data.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.480]   And so I absorbed the idea that I need to be cautious.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.520]   I need to be conservative.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.060]   I need to invest my money properly so it doesn't lose money.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.720]   After all, rule number one is don't lose money.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.000]   And so I adopted a basic philosophy of conservatism.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.720]   Similarly, when I learned about investing, one of the early books that talked to me about
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.440]   investing, and again, part of the basic error that I want you to understand very clearly
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.560]   is the error in not absorbing input from a variety of different perspectives, rather
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.840]   just latching onto a single idea from an early age.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.880]   One of the early books that formed my thinking on investment was the Coffee House Portfolio.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.200]   I think that was the name of the book.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.080]   It was a book that I found at the bookstore, and it talked about the value of index fund
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.080]   investing.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:27.440]   The basic idea was, "Hey, look, you could choose a simple one fund investment."
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:35.480]   I think at the time, the author was advocating for the S&P 500 Index Fund from Vanguard,
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.760]   and he offered a couple of alternative investments, a couple of two fund investments, the idea
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.960]   being a Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund mixed with a bond index fund.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.120]   And the idea was, "Hey, look, with index fund investing, you can become wealthy."
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.120]   And so I understood that.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.200]   I said, "Hey, this is great.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.520]   I'm going to do this."
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.920]   And so I thought I was being an effective investor because I knew how to buy index fund.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   I would go around and tell my friends, "Hey, listen, friends, if you just buy a Vanguard
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.720]   S&P 500 Index Fund, this famous coffeehouse portfolio, you'll be great."
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.280]   But what I didn't understand was all of the other opportunities that were available to
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   me.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.400]   So I chose the conservative investments that are not wrong, but that weren't going to get
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.600]   me on the path to being a multimillionaire by the age of 30.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.120]   A few more examples.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.400]   Let's talk about other examples of investing.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:36.000]   A similar analysis would need to be made about even my own personal ideas on investing at
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.160]   the time.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.480]   For example, through a lot of these books, another example.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:47.400]   When I absorbed in my early 20s Dave Ramsey's books, and I heard Dave Ramsey say again and
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:54.040]   again and again to me as a guy working in a salaried job, "Don't buy single stocks,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   too risky.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.680]   Buy mutual funds instead and buy mutual funds that are well diversified."
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.040]   I absorbed that.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.800]   And then of course later I became a financial services professional and I would absorb all
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.520]   the literature from the wholesalers selling mutual funds.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.120]   And I understood what performance in a mutual fund was driven and how unpredictable it was
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   of single stocks.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   I would read the American funds.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.280]   My favorite brochure that they made was, still make I think, was the Investment Company of
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.360]   America.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.600]   And they always had this chart in there showing basically how difficult it was to predict
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   the companies that were the biggest winners over the course of a long-term perspective
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.240]   if you went back 75 years.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.440]   But then of course compare that to the performance of the Investment Company of America mutual
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.280]   fund and how much better it was.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.480]   And so I absorbed the idea that, well, I can't beat the market and I'll just buy mutual funds
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.200]   instead of single stocks.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:54.680]   So this developed for me this basic mindset of financial conservatism.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:01.480]   So whether from an investment perspective, choosing mutual funds rather than single stocks,
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.400]   choosing conservative mutual funds such as index funds instead of more speculative, aggressive
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:13.440]   funds, or with regard to personal finance, staying out of debt, making sure that you
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   always had rainy day funds, building safe streams of income, etc.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.200]   I developed this concept, this mindset of financial conservatism.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.960]   What I think is true though is this.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:36.680]   First, that concept of financial conservatism may be the best approach for many people.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.440]   I know many people and have worked with many clients for whom I would recommend the exact
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.500]   concepts that I've just listed that work really, really well.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.160]   They work really, really well for people who have a career that is a good fit for them,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.400]   where they enjoy the benefits of the career.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.960]   If I'm working with somebody who enjoys working in a corporate job or professional capacity
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:09.840]   of some kind, they like their day-to-day existence, then my advice to them is going to be maximize
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.480]   your retirement accounts.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.200]   Put good quality, well-diversified investments in those retirement accounts.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.920]   Use mutual funds rather than speculative single stocks.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.180]   I'm going to recommend that plan for them because that seems to fit their overall approach
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.820]   to life.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:33.340]   But that may not fit your approach to life, and it, in hindsight, didn't fit my approach
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.340]   to life.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:41.080]   And when I reflected on many of my clients, I was often envious of my clients who, instead
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.520]   of starting a safe, secure job, went and started a business that had room to grow, and all
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.380]   of a sudden you turn around and a few years later, they could sell the business for a
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.260]   seven-figure sum.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:58.820]   Or perhaps it was observing people who engaged in speculative stock trading, and it really
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.380]   played off and it worked well for them.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.060]   I realized that I was on the wrong path.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.540]   I was in the conservative path.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.460]   And again, to state the matter very clearly, the conservative path is not bad.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.980]   In fact, there can be a lot of good things about it.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:23.800]   But nobody laid out for me the options of the aggressive path, and I was too ignorant
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.260]   in those early days to go and find the benefits of the aggressive path.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:35.340]   By having that sense of conservatism drilled into me by the sources that I chose to engage
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:42.100]   with, I systematically discarded the opportunities that were in front of me, the speculative
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.680]   opportunities, the aggressive, the high risk, the high growth potentials that also came
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   with high risk.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.100]   I discarded those options and opportunities as not right for me because I didn't want
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.040]   to be stupid.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.220]   I wish I'd done it differently.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.140]   Now the great news is the past is the past.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.260]   It literally doesn't exist.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.580]   Today is a brand new day, and it's the first day of your life and my life.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.700]   And so going forward, we can change things.
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:16.180]   And as I've reflected and realized the error of my ways, I've made a different decision.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:21.700]   Going forward, I have decided that I'm going to pursue the aggressive opportunities.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.420]   I'm going to pursue the risky opportunities.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:31.260]   I'm going to pursue the speculation, not just the investment.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:39.620]   Possibly 10 years from now, I'll record another podcast or who knows, maybe a virtual reality
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:46.180]   holographic chat telling you the errors of the speculative way, the errors of the aggressive
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.180]   way.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.180]   And man, I should have just stayed conservative.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.760]   Maybe, but I don't think that's true.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:58.900]   What I have done along the way is I have realized if I will simply define the risks, then I
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:06.220]   can systematically put watertight compartments around the risk and lay out what success and
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.220]   failure would be like.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.740]   And as long as I'm okay with failure and I'm willing to embrace complete and total failure,
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.760]   then there are better opportunities for me to experience far more success by avoiding
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.980]   and eschewing the conservative path in favor of the aggressive and risky path.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:29.380]   Now here, I have two basic fears that I have identified.
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.380]   The first is practical.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.380]   The second is emotional.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.700]   Let's begin with the practical fear.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:39.220]   What I have learned is all risk is not equal.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:48.900]   For example, we all know that flying on airplanes, for example, is statistically quite safe.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.100]   We also know that airplanes sometimes fall apart.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:57.040]   I have a minor hobby of watching disaster videos on YouTube from all the aviation channels
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.100]   that go through airplane crashes.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.020]   And why did such and such an airplane crash?
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.340]   I listen to the black box recordings of the pilots after the fact.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.260]   And I watch the reconstructed flight paths where people take a flight simulator, pretty
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.500]   cool genre of videos on YouTube.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.560]   People take a flight simulator and they'll take a famous airplane crash and they'll show
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.240]   you exactly what happened and why it crashed.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:25.700]   But at the end of the day, I know statistically that flying on an airplane is quite statistically
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.700]   safe.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.160]   There are a lot of people who don't believe that flying on an airplane is statistically
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:37.820]   safe and have this irrational fear of flying on an airplane or just simply a fear of flying
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.820]   on an airplane.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.980]   For me, I look at it and I say, because of the places that I want to go and because of
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:49.820]   the things that I want to do, I don't want to only drive a car across the country.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.100]   And although, of course, we all know that statistically driving a car involves a significant
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.740]   amount of danger, we all on a day to day basis generally tend to ignore that because we're
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.460]   familiar with it.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.600]   I don't want to accept the limitations of exclusively relying on my own wheels to get
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.980]   me from place A to place B. I want to travel the world.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.900]   And so if I'm going to travel the world, I'm going to need to go on an airplane.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.740]   And there are times on an airplane where I'm genuinely concerned.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.100]   I'm genuinely scared.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.980]   I don't think that certainly for pilots become pretty comfortable with turbulence, but I
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.420]   think most of us sitting in the back when the plane starts bouncing up and down, we
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.300]   tighten our seatbelts.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.620]   And tightening our seatbelts is probably a good thing to do.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.700]   But when I'm in that situation, I remind myself I'm trying to get where I want to go.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.700]   I remind myself what turbulence is.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.540]   I have things I teach my children.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.460]   I teach my children that when the plane bounces up and down, it's just like being out on the
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.820]   water when the boat's bouncing up and down.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.220]   It's just bouncing up and down on the air currents.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.260]   I remind myself of the many redundancies.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:56.780]   I remind myself of the fact that, again, bouncing up and down on an airplane is not per se dangerous.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.780]   The airplane is made for it.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.660]   Just like bouncing up and down on a boat is not dangerous.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.580]   The boat is made for that.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.100]   I remember my first intercontinental airplane flight.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.740]   I was 12 years old and I was flying with my parents.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.740]   I looked out the window.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.260]   I saw the wing bouncing up and down.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.940]   And it scared me because I thought that wing shouldn't be bouncing up and down.
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:23.740]   And my dad explained to me that if it's stronger, he being an engineer, he explained that the
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.660]   metal is flexible and thus it's stronger.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.920]   If it were rigid, it would actually be weaker.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.380]   And so it's designed to flex.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.380]   That's the whole point of how the design works.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.180]   So let's bring it back to finances.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:42.460]   Now today, I can see very clearly the ability that I have as a financial engineer to segment
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.280]   and compartmentalize risk.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:54.780]   So for example, if I want to make a speculative investment or speculate on a certain stock,
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:00.680]   something like that, I can look at that and I can understand what the maximum upside and
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.760]   downside risk is.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.460]   I can look at it and I can say, "Hey, if I put X amount of dollars into this investment,
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:12.820]   the lowest my risk would be would be zero, assuming I'm not using leverage and trading
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.340]   options, which could wipe me out even more of that."
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.100]   But I can look at that and I can identify, "Here is the amount of risk and am I willing
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.380]   to take this?"
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.180]   And so instead of just simply saying, "Oh, I don't invest in single stocks," I can look
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.100]   at it and I say, "Well, should I invest in single stocks?
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.400]   Would that get me closer to where I want to go?
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.940]   And then how could I segment that amount of risk in my portfolio?"
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.660]   Similarly, with regard to business.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.100]   I can look at it and I can say, "All right, if I'm going to embark upon a new business,
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.660]   perhaps I'm going to try something.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.780]   What's the worst case scenario?"
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.300]   The worst case scenario is the business goes bankrupt.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.420]   And so for me, once I actually learned how to do bankruptcy planning, then I realized
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.580]   this wasn't so scary.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.940]   But the problem was nobody taught me that I could do bankruptcy planning.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.480]   And so even if I went bankrupt, I would come out the other side able to start again.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.320]   What was I scared of?
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.340]   Similar concepts of risk management.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:14.460]   When I understood how to put in place an effective career insurance policy so that, hey, if a
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.020]   business fails and I go totally broke, what do I do?
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.260]   Well, I need a job.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.940]   And so how can I put in place a strategy so I could quickly go out and get a job making
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:27.020]   a lot of money to make sure that I can pay my bills?
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.500]   And so I can segment the risks.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.780]   I can isolate the risks.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.060]   And I can understand and I can control the risks.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.020]   I can insure against the things that I don't want to happen.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.420]   I can accept the worst case scenario.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:46.380]   And so once I've solved that worst case scenario, right, the classic stoic philosophy of understanding
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.140]   the worst thing that could happen and resolving to be okay with it.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:55.660]   If I can do that financially, then I can go up in the airplane, I can go out on the boat.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:04.060]   And the reality about most financial risks is they're controllable in the circumstances,
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.100]   in the events.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.820]   Example, is business risky?
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.060]   I don't think business is risky really at all.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.980]   That's not to say that businesses don't fail.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.980]   Certainly they do.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.060]   But even when businesses fail, they're not risky.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.140]   Today with my slightly more mature outlook on risk management, I look at employment as
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:32.020]   being fundamentally risky because employees generally tend to have all of their time absorbed
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.780]   with one particular employer.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:41.140]   Thus, they don't have the mental energy usually or the time to be thinking about other opportunities.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:48.140]   And so a lot of times when an employee gets let go, gets fired, gets laid off, is forced
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.740]   out, that employee often doesn't have a backup plan.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.040]   Whereas as a business owner, I have a long list of opportunities, things that I can pursue
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.080]   on the side.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.900]   And so if primary thing fails, I've got secondary option.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.060]   If secondary option fails, I've got tertiary option.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.420]   I've got all these options lined up.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.020]   And in addition, in business, you often know when something is failing.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.420]   It's not doesn't catch you unawares.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.060]   You know when your revenue is falling below your expenses.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.420]   You know when you're running out of money, you know when sales are down.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.320]   And so you can respond and you can react to that.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:27.960]   Many businesses fail largely due to the lack of skill and lack of education of those who
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.000]   are engaging upon them.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.060]   And failure itself is not fundamentally a problem if you are resolved to accept it.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.700]   Similarly, I think about why is it that we're so opposed to risk in the modern world?
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.380]   We often talk about bringing home the bacon.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.940]   I have a significant amount of responsibility.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.920]   I have a wife and four young children who depend upon me to provide for them.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.540]   And so the idea that most people would understand is simply this.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:03.500]   As you get older, then you should take less risk because there are more people depending
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.020]   upon you.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.420]   That's not necessarily wrong.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.340]   Certainly there are more mouths depending upon me.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:17.340]   But we're not living in a world in which business failure means starvation.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:23.620]   Imagine you or I were 150 years in the past and we said maybe we go to the West, right?
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:29.220]   Those of us who are US Americans, or at least I have always had a fondness, a sense of romantic
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.620]   nostalgia about the West.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.180]   You grow up seeing Western movies.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.580]   You appreciate the allure of the American cowboy.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.340]   And so you think, "Man, that would be great."
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.500]   Let's say that I headed out across to go settle the West.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.020]   Government makes me an offer, says, "Hey, we've got a whole bunch of land.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.380]   We want you to come.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:51.580]   If you can come out, we'll give you your 168 acres, sorry, 160 acres, and you need to settle
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.060]   it and homestead it for five years."
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.500]   And so I head out from Chicago and I load up my family in a covered wagon heading out
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.500]   on the Oregon Trail or heading out to the West to Oklahoma to stake my claim.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.900]   That was a fundamentally risky endeavor.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:13.780]   And failure oftentimes meant quite literal death.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:19.660]   If you went out to stake your claim in Oklahoma, there was a very decent chance that if your
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:26.220]   business failed, your crops failed, your family would starve.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:31.980]   If you've never read the classic Farmer, excuse me, Lower House on the Prairie series, I'd
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.980]   encourage you to read it.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.980]   And what's interesting to me, I read the series to my children a couple of years ago.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.460]   In reading that series, I hear things very differently as a father, right?
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:47.900]   There's the classic opportunity when Pa Ingalls, the father and patriarch of that family, his
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:53.060]   crops in Minnesota where he was settled at the time, he had a farm in Minnesota, excuse
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.060]   me.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.820]   Yeah, his crops in Minnesota had failed and he wasn't able to feed his family, so he had
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.820]   to go for work.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.380]   And he walked a hundred and, I forget now, but it was something like 150 miles until
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.980]   he could find work.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.800]   Literally walked and had nothing.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.940]   He walked 150 miles until he could find work, didn't have enough money to send home to feed
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.280]   his family.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:19.720]   And so the consequences of failure in that time could be quite literal life and death.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.700]   Fast forward to today's world, the world in which we live of 2021.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:31.160]   It's virtually unimaginable to me to think of actually facing starvation in the world
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.800]   in which I live.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.000]   I'm not blind to the fact that many people still today do face the prospect of literal
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.600]   starvation.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:46.840]   I'm in contact with them more than you know, but it's almost unimaginable for me to consider
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:53.040]   the prospect of my children actually going hungry.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:59.800]   And what's more important, it's easier than it has ever been for me to have a plan in
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:05.000]   place to make sure that my children would quite literally never go hungry.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.400]   Why do I talk about food insurance and food storage?
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.720]   It's because it's the most effective way to release yourself from the fear of your family
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.880]   going hungry.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:23.580]   Today, if you live in a rich society, like many of us do living in the wealthy West,
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:30.040]   you can go out and for three or four or five or $6,000, you can purchase a year or two
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.580]   worth of calories to feed your family.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:39.360]   Add another thousand dollars of spices and add-ons and you can do it in quite phenomenal
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.580]   comfort.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:46.560]   The costs of the staples of life to keep your family literally alive are lower than they
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.520]   have ever been in human history.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.700]   As a US American, one of the first places that I always went in my budget to try to
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.880]   trim my budgetary expenses was food spending.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.920]   We spend, and yet we spend a tinier percentage of our income on food than many people on
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   the planet.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.960]   There are people on the planet who 80% of their money goes to food and they're living
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.440]   day to day and they cannot figure out how to have enough food for next week.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:17.080]   Whereas for you and I, no doubt our expenditure spent on food is perhaps 10 or 15% of our
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:23.120]   income if we're normal and it could be far lower, far, far lower and still be adequate
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.040]   nutritious food on which we could survive.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:35.080]   This irrational fear that we have of going hungry is really silly.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.760]   There's no reason for me to really even consider it.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.320]   I do consider it, but it's so easy for me to put in place insurance to protect against
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   it.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.640]   Food storage, having family and friends that would help it, having the ability to go get
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:53.040]   a job so that I could go and pay for food if I needed to, having enough money set aside
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.800]   so I could buy food, having access to government welfare programs so they could provide us
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.200]   with food, having access to a food pantry where we could get free food if we were in
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   need.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.320]   All of these are very reasonable things.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:12.200]   And so the idea that in 2021 I should be worrying about going literally hungry is really silly.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.360]   It doesn't make sense when you logically analyze it.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.040]   And yet we, I have used those, those phrases, "Oh, I got to feed my family."
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.200]   And I've convinced myself to take the conservative path called, "I got to feed my family," instead
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.080]   of taking the aggressive path.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   Other simple examples.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.400]   What about going homeless, right?
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.400]   Being without a home?
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.920]   Certainly, there's no question that business failure today could mean that I might lose
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.920]   my house, right?
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.300]   I could have a house, I could have a mortgage, and I might lose my house.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.160]   But really, is this that big of a deal?
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   I think the biggest factor that most of us who are parents worry about if you lose your
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.360]   house is the disruption to your children's lives.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.200]   I'm convinced that's unnecessary.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.720]   I'm convinced that's only a big deal if you teach your children that they should be emotionally
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.840]   traumatized by the loss of a house.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.560]   Throughout history, children have been taken from one place to another.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.840]   Throughout history, children have slept on the ground and been fine.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.960]   Throughout history, children have slept in tents.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.560]   And yet in the modern world, we've babied our children to the point where we don't want
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.360]   them to move houses because all of their memories are here in this room and it would just be
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.800]   too upsetting to them.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.040]   It's something that we make up ourselves.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.480]   So the worst case scenario of losing your house, so what?
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   Big deal.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.760]   Now, there are ways that I personally have tested overcoming this, right?
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.000]   I've talked about one of the reasons I went RVing.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.240]   One of the reasons I went RVing, I want to see what it's like.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.040]   And I'm convinced that RVing is a great way to cut your expenses to almost nothing.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.520]   If you find an old trailer for a few thousand dollars and you can park that trailer somewhere
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.600]   where it can stay for a little while without the cops coming and banging on your door,
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.720]   and you can live in that trailer, then you can be fine.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   You can be fine.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.880]   And so for me, it's always been kind of that last case, worst case scenario.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.440]   If everything I did failed, what would I do?
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.700]   I'd buy an RV, I'd go and live in the trailer and we'd have an adventure.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.700]   We would love it.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:12.100]   There's, I mean, rich people all over the place.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:19.000]   So many of financial planners' clients are millionaires and their dream is to become
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.800]   a millionaire, retire from their work and go and buy a car so they can live in it.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   Now their car is shiny.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.840]   It has a lot of chrome, it has a lot of marble in it.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.600]   Oftentimes it's pretty heavy and they buy a nice new pickup truck to tow it around and
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   park it in a camp.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.680]   At the end of the day though, you're living in a car and there's fundamentally very little
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:42.480]   difference between a million dollar new car and a $5,000 old junky travel trailer, a fifth
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.700]   wheel that you pick up somewhere.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:49.660]   And so you can always have a solution or even just quite simply a tent.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.920]   Over the years, I've gotten good enough at camping that I realized, you know what?
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.180]   I could live quite comfortably.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:59.220]   I'd buy, I have a nice canvas wall tent, have a good cooking station set up, all of this.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.060]   Today it's just, it's easy.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.700]   It's easy and it's comfortable.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.700]   Right?
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.420]   If you go to Africa on safari, you're going to go out to some bush camp and you could
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.620]   pay a guy tens of thousands of dollars to sleep in a tent.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.820]   And it's adventurous and you got to be rich to do it.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.700]   Well, I'm not going to be homeless.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   And so why am I worried about being homeless?
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:22.020]   Now add on to that all of the tools of negotiation that you have, right?
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.700]   There's people in the United States who haven't paid, they've had rent eviction, excuse me,
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.700]   eviction moratoriums.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.020]   They've been living rent free in houses for months and months and months and months and
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.220]   months.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.940]   And you get into a bad financial crisis.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:39.820]   I had a new people back in 2007, 2008, 2009, who lived in houses without making a single
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:45.460]   mortgage payment for literally years, literally years.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:49.780]   So why are we concerned about being homeless again?
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   What's a worst case scenario?
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.940]   I call a friend of mine up and I say, listen, man, I need a place from, can, can, can you
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.620]   help us with a place to stay for a few weeks so I can get a job?
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:06.020]   I had to keep a credit card set aside and I say, and I call up Airbnb and I rent a house
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.740]   for a couple of months on a credit card with money I don't have so I can get a job.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:18.020]   The worst case scenario of being homeless is just, it doesn't have the same trouble
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.580]   that it had centuries ago.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:25.140]   And yet a lot of us are spending time worrying about being homeless.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.260]   It makes no sense.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.940]   What's worse is I worried about that stuff when I was single.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.620]   Not worried, but I mean, I was, I was, I was making decisions when I was single as if it
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.140]   might actually be possible for me to be homeless and that might actually be a bad thing.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.180]   It's silly.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:47.300]   And you see a whole world and kind of counterculture of van liver, van dwellers all around the
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   world.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:53.580]   I've observed here in Europe, the van dwelling culture here in Europe is very strong.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:39:00.420]   There's this whole culture of people living in vehicles as a primary opportunity.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:07.540]   Years ago, I came across the story of, I think it was Bob Wells, the guy who started the
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.940]   cheap RV living story.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.780]   But he told the story of his first vehicle when he went through a bad divorce, had no
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:17.340]   money, he bought a box van and he turned the box van into his first house.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.620]   And it's a great house, right?
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.100]   I love to go on YouTube and find all these guys who, who turn an old box van or a van
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.580]   or a car or whatever into something very comfortable for them.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:33.020]   And so when you know that you could, you could live on $500 a month of income, well now the
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.980]   worst case scenario, you're totally wiped out.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.580]   You're totally bankrupt.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.340]   It's not such a bad deal.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.340]   It's not.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:45.180]   There are people doing it by choice and living very well, many times with, with much greater
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.420]   freedom than a lot of us.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:53.460]   And so what I wish I had connected when I was earlier was the fact that the worst case
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:59.940]   scenario, practically speaking, is not nearly as bad as you think it is.
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:06.380]   Now I use that kind of low end scenario to try to bring good examples that will appeal
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.800]   universally.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:14.100]   But realistically, there's no reason why you or I really should ever or would ever be in
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.100]   that scenario.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:24.340]   I mean, 10,000 bucks tucked aside, sitting and saving somewhere, a dozen ounces of gold
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:30.700]   tucked aside in a jar in your mother's backyard flowerbed.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.100]   These are the kinds of things that you never have to be there.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:39.300]   Although I would, I think I would be capable enough to be fine in those situations.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.700]   It's just not, you know, I'll never, I don't think I'll ever be there.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.460]   And if I am fine, I'll deal with it.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.420]   But I don't think I'll ever be there.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:51.140]   What's more important though, is to realize that risks can be segmented, even the biggest
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.220]   risks.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.940]   And as I've become more thoughtful and educated on simple financial engineering, I've realized
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:01.740]   that even those worst case scenarios, they don't happen.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.220]   They don't happen.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.020]   Good example, right?
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:13.060]   I have, I have, and so many millions of people have deeply appreciated the work of well-known
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.900]   financial educator, Dave Ramsey.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.580]   Dave Ramsey's origin story includes the fact that he went bankrupt.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:27.140]   And I think it's a valuable and useful origin story to understand.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:34.040]   Now what Dave has done from that is he has built onto that story, the principles of success
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.460]   that he has used to take him to where he is today.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.860]   And I deeply appreciate Dave more than I ever did.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.380]   I think he does a lot of good work.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.860]   And at the end of his career, he'll be able to look back with tremendous satisfaction
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.900]   on quite literally millions of families that he has helped.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:42:00.060]   However, there are a couple of things that I think are often unsaid that I absorbed as
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.920]   a disciple of Dave in those early days, that today I reject.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:13.120]   For example, was Dave's use of debt the thing that brought his entire empire down?
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.000]   My answer is no.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.320]   It was Dave's use of stupid debt that brought his empire down.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.500]   He was engaging in short-term financing for his real estate investments.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.960]   And as I understand the story, bank that he was working with got sold, looked down and
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.040]   said, "Why do we have all this money lent out to this 20-year-old kid?"
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.520]   And calling his loans and he was left scrambling.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.200]   What's interesting though, when you listen to Dave tell the story is even with all of
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.260]   that stacked against him, he almost got out.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:47.640]   He almost got out.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.240]   He was so close to being able to avoid bankruptcy.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.280]   He was selling buildings, he was renegotiating.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   He was so close to being able to avoid bankruptcy.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:01.180]   Now ultimately, he did go through bankruptcy, came out the other side, rebuilt an empire.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.760]   But just with a little bit of thoughtful risk management planning, Dave could have effectively
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.640]   used debt in his situation and have never gone through bankruptcy.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.240]   With a little bit of thoughtful bankruptcy planning, Dave could have been much better
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.660]   positioned to go through bankruptcy and come out the other side.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:26.760]   But even with all of that, I don't think Dave or his children ever went hungry.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:31.600]   At the very least, he had a strong family network to draw upon, an exceedingly valuable
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.480]   resource.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:43.040]   He had good marketable skills, and he was able to start over and rebuild an empire.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:49.480]   And it was his risk that he took to build a business that resulted in his becoming today
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.080]   a very, very wealthy man.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.860]   I think I've given enough practical examples.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.800]   What I've reflected upon and realized is simply this.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.840]   We don't live in the world of 1800.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.960]   We don't live in the world in which you and I are penniless migrants, right?
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.560]   The classic story, what they literally did was burning down our house in the east so
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.680]   that we could collect the nails to go load up in our covered wagon and go to the West.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:29.920]   And we would take those nails with us because that was the most valuable thing of a house.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:36.120]   Now the spirit, the indomitable spirit of those early pioneers and early settlers of
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:42.200]   the West, that spirit is what should inspire us.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:48.240]   And when I think about Pa Ingalls, right, what did he do?
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.880]   At one point, his family literally lived in a house that was carved out of a riverbank,
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:45:00.480]   a cave in the side of a riverbank, and they were happy to have it.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:06.240]   Now I need to keep working on my own family to make sure that if we lived in a house carved
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.400]   in the side of a riverbank, we would be happy.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   I think we could do it.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.920]   I'm probably the one who wouldn't want to do it.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.360]   My wife probably wouldn't complain.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.560]   My children probably wouldn't complain.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.000]   They'd think it'd be a grand adventure.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.920]   Just to me, it's unthinkable.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.360]   And I'm the radical guy, right, and it's still unthinkable.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.920]   I think about going into a small house, I don't want to live in a small house.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.340]   I'm beyond that.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.080]   Which brings me quite nicely to that second big problem.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.080]   So the first problem is practical, practical finances.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.680]   And what I've tried to show is that as I've reflected on this, I've realized that these
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.120]   fears that I have are silly.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:41.880]   They're totally unfounded and they're easily solved.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.280]   A little bit of savings, right?
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:51.440]   If you start with nothing, go work at a job for a year, go get a job, making $40,000,
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:57.080]   $30,000, spend 20 or 25 and save 10 and then start and make sure that and say, I'm going
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.260]   to have $10,000 a part.
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.160]   And then the other thing is just in the world we live in, you can build something great
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.480]   with nothing, with relatively nothing.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:13.640]   I have loved and been so inspired by the Bitcoin revolution in which we're living.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:22.240]   One of my favorite things has been realizing how many Bitcoin millionaires have been minted
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.440]   because they were convinced of the opportunity they saw and they put within it, right?
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:33.000]   I like, what's her name, the crypto chick, Heidi, the crypto chick and her story, she
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.600]   and her boyfriend, husband, not sure, she was working as a waitress so that she could
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.720]   earn money to pay for Bitcoin.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.680]   Well, fast forward now, she's built a massive business advising people on Bitcoin, has become
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.480]   quite wealthy, but she started working as a waitress, living on nothing, putting every
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.160]   dollar into Bitcoin.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.420]   That's the spirit of those who win.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.680]   They have an opportunity, they have something they want to go after and they go after it.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   I didn't do that.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   I could have done it.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.440]   I could have made far more money than Heidi did, but I was hamstrung by this excessive
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.800]   sense of conservatism.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.400]   I was hamstrung by not wanting to go broke.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.280]   Now, I said there were two things.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.240]   The first thing is the practical side.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.780]   And what I've realized is the practical side is eminently solvable.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:25.560]   It's eminently solvable just through a simple thinking process and putting in place the
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:31.320]   appropriate insurance policies, meaning quite literally, in some cases, insurance contracts
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.680]   with insurance companies, in other cases, simply an insurance policy of something like
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:40.120]   having savings, an insurance policy of having food stored, having a tent.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:45.400]   Although I don't currently own it, if I moved back to the United States, one thing that
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:51.600]   I would do, disaster standpoint, is just I would buy a nice wall tent, spend my $3,000
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.520]   on a nice wall tent, put it aside in a trailer, have some other stuff in there, and then I
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.320]   would know, hey, if worse comes to worse, we got a tent.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.680]   I can call up a friend of mine who's got a big backyard.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.000]   I got a list of friends who've got multi-acres, and I could say, "Hey, man, can I set up a
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   tent in your backyard?
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.880]   I need to get my feet under me for a couple of months.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.800]   Can I just live in your backyard in a tent for a couple of months?"
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   And it would be great.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.160]   It'd be a little adventure.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.920]   So like you could put in place all those things, and they're absurdly cheap.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:22.880]   They're absurdly cheap to do.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.240]   So what's the second thing that has often kept me acting conservatively when I wish
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.240]   I hadn't?
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.720]   The answer is pride.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.560]   I think this is the bigger one for me.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.840]   It's pride.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:41.000]   The pride of wanting to be right and the pride of not wanting to be a failure.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.920]   I think this is common to most of us, right?
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.120]   We gain, we have a self-image.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.280]   We have a way that we view ourselves.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:56.960]   And what often hurts more with failure is the hurt to our pride rather than the actual
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   impact.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.200]   There was one client I'm thinking of that I worked with years ago, and this was a client
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.800]   that really struck me.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:10.360]   This was a client, he was a highly paid salesman, and he'd built a comfortable career.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.760]   He was quite good at what he was.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.160]   I met him in some charitable work that I was doing at the time.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.640]   He unexpectedly got laid off from his job, and he thought it was totally unjust, but
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.080]   he was not in a place where he had the money set aside.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.920]   He was not in a place where he, he wasn't in a good place at the time.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.880]   He was living a high lifestyle because he was making a lot of money.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.040]   Children were in private schools.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.720]   They were in a nice house, etc.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.320]   And he got laid off.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:41.640]   And when I worked with him in the situation, what was obvious to me is his pride made it
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:49.360]   very hard for him to accept the reality of the circumstances that he was in.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.880]   For him to have to pull his children out of the private school was going to be really
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.520]   difficult, and I understand that.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:01.880]   But I always think of him, and I realize how much my own pride has often kept me from pulling
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.600]   back from, excuse me, my own pride has often kept me from pressing forward.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.120]   It's caused me to pull back.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.440]   All right, it's one thing to say, you know, Bitcoin, for example, what was, why didn't
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.240]   I see Bitcoin at an early age?
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.160]   Why didn't I speculate on it?
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.240]   I could have, I had money.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.400]   I could have speculated on it.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   What was it?
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.800]   It was a pride.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:29.440]   At its core, it was my pride of not wanting to do something stupid with money, because
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.920]   I saw myself as somebody who makes intelligent decisions with money.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.120]   I saw myself as somebody who gives advice about money.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:40.840]   I saw myself as the kind of guy who does things right.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:46.120]   And because it was unproven, I didn't know if it was going to be right or wrong.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.760]   I didn't know.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.200]   And so because of that, I didn't get involved because I wanted to protect my pride.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   I wanted to be intellectually certain before investing my money into Bitcoin.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:10.680]   Now, the specific use here of Bitcoin is unimportant, meaning for all I know, 10 years from now,
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.560]   Bitcoin could be utterly worthless.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.340]   Could be.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:21.400]   There are good arguments as to why it very well could be.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.540]   Also, of course, good arguments as to why it could not.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:33.240]   But would I rather have the intellectual certainty of 10 years from now being able to say to
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.580]   someone, "Ha ha, I knew it was coming," or would I rather have become a multimillionaire
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:44.100]   from investing early on in something that should have been a perfect fit for me?
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:48.880]   It's a fascinating thing for me to think about.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.960]   It was my pride that stood in my position, in my way.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:58.360]   It was the pride, the pride of not wanting to be wrong and especially not wanting to
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.020]   be wrong publicly.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:04.200]   Similar things with other investments along the way.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.660]   It was the pride of not wanting to fail.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.140]   Why didn't I build when I was younger?
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:13.980]   Why didn't I build a very large real estate portfolio when my buddies were doing it?
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:18.420]   Well, first, there were those around me who were conservative, who were advising me not
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.660]   to take risk.
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.340]   Today, I appreciate that.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:26.620]   In fact, I think that in many cases I was held back from making mistakes.
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:32.160]   What I now realize is that many of those people didn't have a proper concept of risk.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.040]   They didn't actually understand what the true risks were.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:41.020]   They were saying the things that they thought were true by lack of experience.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.700]   Here would be a metaphor.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:50.700]   Imagine that you're on your way to the airport, but you have just met somebody who is an unintelligent
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:57.860]   an uneducated, illiterate, I don't know, indigenous Indian from the middle of nowhere.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:04.980]   You're in Ecuador or you're in Australia or somewhere and you've just met someone who
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.380]   has seen, who's never even seen an airplane.
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.300]   And you tell them, "I'm going to go up in this airplane here."
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.660]   And they look at you and they say, "What?
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.180]   You're going to go up in that airplane?
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.180]   You can't do that.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.540]   The airplane is going to fall out of the sky."
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:21.100]   Well, you try to explain to them how airplanes fly and air pressures and aerodynamics and
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.100]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.380]   You try to explain to them, "Hey, there's a good indication of, you know, where there's
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:32.880]   decades of experience and safety and there's some risk, but it's risk is pretty well managed."
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.740]   Their minds would not be able to conceive of it, right?
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.180]   Because they've never been on an airplane.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.240]   They can't conceive of it.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.620]   It takes time and experience for that person to understand what an airplane is, how it
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:50.260]   works and to understand, yes, there are risks in flying in an airplane.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:54.800]   Here's what those risks are and here's how those risks can be avoided.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.900]   And by extension, if we think about that metaphor, a lot of times the people that we ask advice
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:08.540]   from are well-meaning, ignorant people who have no understanding of what we're actually
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.540]   getting involved in.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:16.100]   They're well-meaning, ignorant people who have no understanding of what the actual risks
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:22.740]   are.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.740]   So we have to be careful.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:28.980]   But at the end of the day, your pride gets in your way and you start to think, "You know
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:29.980]   what?
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.980]   I've done pretty well.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:31.980]   I've done pretty well."
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.980]   And it gets in your way.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:39.900]   One of the characteristics that I see of people who have become successful is that they've
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:47.540]   made enough mistakes to be able and be willing to admit those mistakes and to the point where
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.360]   a mistake doesn't bother them so much.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.860]   Think about somebody who is skillful.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.540]   Few examples come to mind.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.800]   First, I'll just give a personal one.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:07.020]   When I was a novice, brand new financial advisor, I was scared of ever saying, "I don't know,"
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.220]   because I thought, "Well, I should know."
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.900]   Someone's going to ask me a question and I should know.
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.640]   Today, I frequently don't know.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.340]   But I'm not scared of it because I know, number one, I do know a lot.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:23.440]   Number two, there's more out there than I could ever learn in a dozen lifetimes of studying.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.540]   So "I don't know" is the only acceptable response.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:32.180]   And my pride is not engaged anymore in fear of saying, "I don't know something."
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:39.180]   Similarly, let's say you're out with an athlete or maybe you're shooting.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.100]   You go out and I enjoy shooting guns.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.420]   You go out with somebody who's a great shot.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.020]   They know they're a great shot.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:48.780]   And they'll pull a shot and they'll miss completely and they'll laugh because their pride is not
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.780]   involved in it.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:50.780]   They know they're a good shot.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.500]   They know how to shoot and they've missed so many targets over the years.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.780]   They know to laugh when they miss one.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:01.720]   Whereas a novice will pick a big deal about missing, or perhaps an athlete is a good example.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:07.780]   Somebody who is a skillful athlete who puts up a shot and they miss the basket, they don't
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   worry about it.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.660]   They just go and hustle down the court, get the ball and try again.
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:18.460]   Whereas somebody who's not that way will be worried about missing the shot.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:23.780]   Would seem appropriate to insert the classic Wayne Gretzky quote, I think it was, "You
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.700]   miss 100% of the shots you don't take."
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.140]   You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:38.620]   And so do I want to be the guy sitting on the sidelines proud of the fact that I don't
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:42.660]   miss shots while watching the game from the sidelines?
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:47.220]   Or do I want to be the guy out there who went for it, took the game-winning, potentially
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:53.460]   game-winning shot and missed, but knows that that's just one shot out of a career of thousands,
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:56.300]   thousands of shots?
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.820]   That's the way I now look at business and investment.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:05.580]   If I can solve that pride issue, and I can force myself to come against my pride, and
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:10.900]   I can force myself to be humble and not to worry about it, but to simply systematically
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:19.620]   take shots, take thoughtful shots, take careful shots, but systematically take shots, then
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:25.740]   that in and of itself can transform everything.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:31.420]   I've got to be the kind of guy who takes shots.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:37.900]   And though some will miss, many will not.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:44.580]   And as long as the odds of, you know, the penalties for the missed shots is not completely
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.380]   catastrophic and I, what would be catastrophic, right?
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:53.100]   I think for me, catastrophic would be loss of life, pretty much.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:57.300]   I used to say divorce and I still believe that, but at the end of the day, I've talked
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:03.580]   – meaning that I would say divorce is catastrophic for me, because I care very deeply about marriage.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:09.780]   Even over the last few years, I've spoken to enough people who, from my perspective,
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:14.620]   have been completely faithful and everything is still ended in divorce that I've even taken
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:19.980]   that off of my list, meaning that I intend to stay married, but even that, sometimes
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.340]   divorce is out of your hands.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:27.500]   There are many men and women who've done literally nothing wrong and had everything changed in
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.060]   their lives, but divorce is not catastrophic.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.780]   Life is not over after divorce.
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.420]   Really the only thing that ends life is death.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.500]   Life is over after death.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:42.700]   Well, at least this mortal life is over after death.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:49.060]   And even that, as long as you've lived well and you've lived properly, you've lived righteously,
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:55.340]   you've lived a life that was befitting your capacity, that's not the end of the deal.
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:57.460]   It's not the end of anything.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:02.140]   It's just the beginning.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:12.380]   I don't have all of my strategies worked out perfectly on how to avoid the pride issue.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.540]   I've worked on some of them.
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.180]   I'm quite literally working on one right now.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:21.900]   I've recorded this show over past months several times, but it's always felt like it wasn't
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.900]   quite smooth enough.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.180]   It wasn't quite polished enough.
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:27.460]   It wasn't quite accurate enough.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:31.400]   It wasn't quite the best.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.500]   And so I've canned it, deleted it, canned it, deleted it.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:40.140]   That's always a good sign, I think, of a difficult topic that really is a matter of my pride
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:45.660]   more than it is my willingness to serve.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:51.060]   Because if I've found this mistake in my own past and I've analyzed it to realize why I
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:56.820]   have made this mistake many times, and then if I found ways of overcoming that mistake,
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:02.340]   even if my ability to overcome it is not perfect, then I do a disservice if I don't share it.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:07.660]   I do a disservice if I don't go after it.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:14.900]   And so you're listening to this now as an expression of that, an imperfectly created,
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:19.060]   not quite as beautiful of a presentation as I would like, but get it out there.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:23.180]   Ignore the pride, get it out there and press on.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:28.200]   The most important thing is taking shots.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.140]   If you desire to build wealth, if you desire to build financial freedom, you have to take
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:37.700]   shots, you have to go, you have to try.
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.420]   And it's okay if you miss some.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.660]   It's okay if you miss a lot of them.
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:50.900]   What's not okay is sitting on the sidelines wishing that you took more shots.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.620]   It's not the critics who count.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.380]   It's the man who's in the arena, right?
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.180]   That's the one who counts.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:05.880]   In closing out today's show, what I want to emphasize is the regrets that I have on this
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:15.180]   particular topic could really only have been avoided if I had been more open and more thoughtful
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.180]   as I see it.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:24.940]   They could only have been avoided if I had been diligent to expose myself to a more diverse
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.560]   realm of opinion.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:38.940]   From a financial perspective, I followed frequently the advice of those that, of the people that
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.660]   I articulated and others as well.
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:48.260]   But what happened is I got into a feedback loop where I was only consuming advice from
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:52.900]   one segment of the marketplace.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:02:00.620]   I was consuming advice at that time from largely mainstream people who were giving kind of
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.340]   the standard line.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:16.060]   And my results didn't start to change until I started to absorb advice from a different
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:20.900]   cast of characters, from a different set of people.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:33.220]   And then as I consumed advice from those people, then I started to realize things differently.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.420]   I've told this story.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.640]   I want to tell it again because I believe it's so important, and then I'll give the
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:44.960]   application that I have yet to fulfill in my own life.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:51.200]   I for years believed that investing in gold was stupid.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.380]   I had a long list of arguments as to why I thought investing in gold was stupid.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.380]   Gold is unproductive.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.920]   Anyway, I'm not going to go to the arguments.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.640]   But then I changed the advice.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.680]   I changed the people that I was accepting advice from, and I came across somebody who
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.800]   was strongly giving the advice to buy and own gold.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.440]   And for a long time I listened to the arguments and I considered them.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:23.320]   And I asked the man for advice one time, and he's like, "How much gold do you own?"
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.560]   I wrote back and I said, "None."
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.960]   And he's like, "Well, nothing's going to change until you go buy a gold coin.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.960]   Go buy a gold coin."
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.880]   I still have that gold coin.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.280]   It was a 1/10 ounce American Eagle.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.600]   I went to the coin shop and I bought a 1/10 ounce American Eagle.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.120]   I don't remember exactly the price of gold, something a couple hundred, maybe 200 or 300
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.200]   bucks for it, something like that.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.880]   And that one gold coin changed everything.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.840]   I remember I walked into the coin shop, I felt like I was doing a drug deal.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.400]   I felt totally exposed.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.560]   Here I am, a financial advisor, and financial advisors are supposed to tell people not to
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560]   own gold.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.400]   And if you are going to own gold, make sure you own it in ETF and it's 3% of your portfolio,
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.400]   blah, blah, blah.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400]   This is all the stuff.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.840]   And I felt like I was betraying my profession by going to the coin shop and buying a gold
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840]   coin.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   So I bought a gold coin.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.000]   I went out in my car and I sat and I held the thing.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.040]   And I looked at this little tiny thing, about the size of a dime, maybe a little bigger,
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:26.480]   and sitting there looking at it saying, "This thing is worth this much money."
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:33.920]   But over time, that single gold coin totally transformed my understanding of the gold market.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.280]   Same thing, similar thing happened.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.800]   Next time I bought Bitcoin.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.560]   And all of a sudden it's like, "Oh, I understand.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.040]   I started to change the world."
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:48.880]   The thing I haven't yet done, the current revolution of last few months is NFTs.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:54.280]   I have not purchased any kind of digital ownership because I think it's dumb.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.960]   I think it's really dumb.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.280]   And I watch the market, watch the market, watch the market, and I'm like, "This is
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.580]   dumb."
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:04.760]   But then over time, this market can change.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:10.160]   And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to find something and buy something and basically
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.120]   commit to throwing the money away because I know that when I do it, it will change my
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   perspective.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.120]   It'll change my opinion.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.480]   And what I want to do going forward from a financial perspective, and I've tried to practice
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.000]   this, I'm just telling on myself to say that I don't do this perfectly, is I want to try
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.820]   to get involved in as many things as possible so that I have exposure to them.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.000]   Because you understand the market very differently.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.520]   Today, for example, on gold, or today, I look at the market very differently.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.360]   I'm not a gold bug.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.200]   I do very little content on gold.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.720]   I don't talk about gold in the same way that I feared that I would talk about it.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.200]   But I also see the hollowness of a lot of arguments.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.800]   And I realize that a lot of people who are opposed to something like owning gold coins
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.240]   are in the same place that I was.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.040]   They're repeating arguments against it, never having done it.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:09.280]   And thus they don't understand the actual value of things like gold coins.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.440]   In the same way, a lot of people who are against your starting a business are repeating the
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.040]   arguments never having done it.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.960]   People who are against your buying a house, a rental house, are repeating the arguments
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.240]   because they haven't done it.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.480]   Many people who are against your buying an NFT are repeating the arguments because they
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.420]   haven't done it.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.720]   We can't know for certain where the future of the world is.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:40.760]   The NFT marketplace, the Bitcoin marketplace, these new expansions of technology are rather
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.760]   fascinating.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.760]   They're fundamentally new.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.000]   There's no certainty of success.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.120]   There are good arguments for and against many expressions of these things that I'm talking
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.600]   about and whatever else comes next year.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.160]   But if you want to win, you've got to be in the game.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:08.660]   You've got to be actually going for something and you've got to be taking the shots.
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:12.360]   Take thoughtful shots, take intelligent shots, take shots that have a high chance of going
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.360]   in.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:19.480]   If you don't have any money, I don't think that it makes a lot of sense for you to, you
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.120]   know, to start by not saving cash, but going out and trading NFTs.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.920]   I don't think it makes a lot of sense.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:31.440]   I've seen some stories of some teenage boys and younger who made a lot of money trading
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.160]   NFTs.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.520]   And what happens is that when someone takes an interest in something, there's always a
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.680]   market in something.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.440]   I've never in my life been interested in Pokemon cards, but I went and did a bunch of research
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:54.280]   when Jake Paul did his fight with the big boxer, the anyway, the I can't remember his
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.480]   name, the really well-known boxer.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.960]   And he came out and he wore this Pokemon card that everyone said was worth unbelievable
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.120]   money.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.760]   There's people who've gotten super rich in that marketplace of trading and owning Pokemon
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.880]   cards, while most of us have no clue about it.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:15.160]   You don't have to be involved in everything, but don't be like I have been.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:23.520]   Don't repeat the mistakes that I have made of sitting back on the sidelines, ridiculing
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:30.080]   in some cases, or just being silent because of either number one, an irrational financial
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:37.520]   fear, a financial fear of catastrophe, or number two, a very intense need to protect
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.360]   your ego.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.600]   That's not the winner's path.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:49.880]   I regret thinking and behaving conservatively in the past.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.240]   I regret it.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:59.920]   And when I look at my life today, almost all of the things that I am most grateful for
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.280]   have come from taking a risk.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:07.200]   Even if we get totally outside of the financial realm.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.120]   Remember when I asked my wife to marry me?
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.480]   I was scared.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.120]   I'm very grateful I did it.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.120]   I wish I'd done it sooner.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.520]   Remember when we had our first baby?
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   I was scared.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.680]   Grateful we had a baby.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.880]   Wish we'd had one sooner.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.860]   Life is full of risks.
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:33.120]   Life is full of things that can be scary.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:42.080]   And yet, I think the pathway of those who go for it, really go for it, whatever that
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.760]   means to you, really go for it, that's the satisfying pathway.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.840]   And here's what's amazing about life.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.640]   As long as you're literally alive, you can always try again.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.120]   You can always reinvent yourself.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.960]   You can always adjust.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   You're not static.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.960]   You're not stuck.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.840]   I don't care if you're 13, 30, or 83.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:15.960]   You can always reinvent yourself.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:21.040]   That's a powerful thing to realize.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.040]   I try not to regret the past.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.000]   I really hate the concept of regret.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.880]   Because the reality is, I made the best decisions that I could at every point in time.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.120]   And so I don't like the concept of regret.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.840]   We all do the best that we know.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.400]   We do the best that we can.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.040]   We do everything that we're capable of.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.800]   We do our very best.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.480]   So there's really no point in regretting the past.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:52.440]   Rather, I want to press on.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.560]   But still, we can learn from the past.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.480]   And I hope that you've enjoyed learning from my lesson.
