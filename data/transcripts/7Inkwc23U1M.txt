[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   We just get a brief recap of the general parameters for an excellent power and strength training
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440]   program.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200]   Okay, let me hit you with these rapid fire.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.760]   And then you can maybe come ask questions along that.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.400]   Remember those modifiable variables, okay, so let's go through them in order.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.600]   And then what they mean specifically for power versus strength.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.140]   So modifiable variable number one is called choice.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.800]   So which exercises do I select for strength, in general for power, or speed or strength,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.860]   we want to select compound movements.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.900]   You don't often see people doing maximum strength work for like a tricep kickback, right?
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.440]   It's typically multiple joint movements and typically complex movements.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.900]   In selecting these compound movements, we generally want to actually think about exercise
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.560]   selection of movements rather than muscle groups.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.960]   So this is an important distinction because we'll see this is a different answer when
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.960]   we get to hypertrophy.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.820]   What I mean by that is, when we think about, again, strength training, we tend to think
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.020]   about bodybuilding concepts.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.260]   We go to the gym and we do things like I got to make sure I get my chest today and I got
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.440]   to make sure I get my hamstrings and now you're selecting exercises based on a muscle you
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440]   want to work.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.860]   For strength development and power, we want to think about movements rather than individual
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.860]   muscle groups.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.460]   So there should be like things like I need to train explosive hip extension, which is
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.600]   like a vertical jump or something like that.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.660]   I want to train pushing or pulling movements or I want to train rotation, which is a whole
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.100]   area we haven't gotten into, which is very important for overall health and wellness
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.100]   longevity.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.180]   So we want to select big movements by the muscle, the movement patterns that we want
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.180]   to introduce.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.280]   And we just want to select a reasonable balance between these.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.700]   I don't care what the exact ratio is.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.420]   You just don't want to go an entire six months without doing anything in this rotational
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.620]   area or an entire, you know, eight to ten weeks without doing something that's a lower
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.140]   body hinge.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780]   So any number of examples there.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.880]   So just think about the rough movement patterns upper and lower, push and pull, and then some
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.020]   sort of rotation.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.020]   That puts you in a pretty good spot.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.980]   If you're using three by five method and you're going to pick as little as three exercises,
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.580]   just pick one from each one of those groups.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.340]   Pick a rotation, pick a push and pick a pull.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.020]   I can easily think of a push and a pull.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.900]   So for example, bench press or shoulder press, row or chin for pull, and then squat or deadlift
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   for hinge.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   Yep.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.460]   What would be a good example of a quality rotational movement?
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.460]   Yep.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.380]   So anytime you can use a cable machine like at the gym and you can do, it's kind of hard
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.900]   to describe this exercise, but basically you're going to stand facing the cable and you're
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.640]   going to pull it towards yourself and then rotate like you're pivoting, like you're either
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.300]   swinging a golf club or hitting a baseball bat.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.940]   So you're facing one direction.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.060]   I'm facing you right now.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.500]   I'm pulling the cable towards myself and then I'm going to spin, do a 180 degree pivot and
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.100]   face exactly away from you when I finish and then return it back in that same spot.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.100]   So that's a rotation.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.100]   Great.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.300]   We will provide a link to an example of that, that you consider a quality example.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.100]   A medicine ball throw, any number of things like this are great rotational exercise.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   All right.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.500]   So we select our exercises based on that.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.420]   We generally then, because of that as a case, we don't worry about things like eccentric
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.480]   versus concentric because you're generally doing a whole body athletic movement, right?
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.340]   Which the eccentric concentric portion is going to be folded into that and you really
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.740]   can't separate them out.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.740]   All right.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.780]   So that's exercise choice, our first variable.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.800]   The next one is exercise order.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.060]   So because that everything driving power and strength is quality based, you want to do
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.940]   these at the beginning of your workout.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.720]   You would not want to do anything fatiguing before this.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.500]   So no cardiovascular training, no other repetition to failure stuff.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.340]   If you do those before and now you're slower, all you've done is practice getting slower.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.960]   And so these need to be done when you're fresh.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.260]   You also need to do them when you're very fresh because they are the most neurologically
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.260]   demanding.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.260]   They're complicated.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.380]   They tend to have multiple steps and they're often in multiple planes and coordination
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.380]   is a difficult thing.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.620]   And if you're trying to do all that at maximum speed, your nervous system needs to be tremendously
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.620]   fresh.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.220]   And so any amount of fatigue here is only going to compromise results.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.740]   To kind of recap that, one of the major mistakes when training for strength and especially
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.460]   power is people worry way too much about fatigue.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.820]   Those things should not be part of the equation.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.620]   In fact, if they are, that's a very good sign you're not doing this correctly, right?
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.560]   These are non-fatiguing movements, especially speed and power.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.900]   So choice, order is next.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.500]   The next one after that is volume and we sort of hit volume and intensity, which is the
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.120]   other one.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.260]   We talked about that.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.700]   The volume is basically identical between power and strength.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.820]   The general number we're going to look at here is something like three to 20 sets.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.060]   Total per workout.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060]   Per workout.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.620]   But that would be like 20 would be a little bit of a special case.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.620]   Three to five is what I told you earlier, right?
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.140]   I'm just saying like sometimes you can actually go quite higher in these cases.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.580]   But that's the general range.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.780]   And once somebody finishes the three by five workout for power or strength, if they decide
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.100]   they want to throw in some calf raises and curls and totally a forearm work or a little
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.180]   bit of a jogging on the treadmill or something, that's okay.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.180]   Absolutely.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.660]   There is a very little risk of interference for things like speed and power.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.620]   Strength you have a little bit of a risk only because now you're introducing fatigue, which
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.500]   if you're really pushing strength, that might compromise your recovery.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.260]   I could imagine doing the three to five routine for strength or for power and then somebody
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.380]   finishing up with 10 or 15 minutes of hypertrophy arm work and then being very seriously compromised
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.780]   if they try and come in the next day or even the next day.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.780]   Correct.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.700]   And do those big compound movements for speed and power.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   That's right.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.380]   Not just because they're sore, but the muscles may actually still be damaged.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.220]   And I know later we're going to talk about the somewhat tenuous relationship between
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.820]   soreness and recovery.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.820]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.820]   Yep.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.340]   So that's a really nice heuristic to pay attention to is you can, but just be careful.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.500]   Energy starts to matter at that point.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.540]   If you're really truly trying to maximize strength, you would do nothing at all outside
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.300]   of that training.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.220]   If you're just like, I kind of want to get stronger and some other things, and you're
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.660]   willing to lose strength, you know, 5% of your strength gains, then you're totally fine.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.620]   The same can be said, by the way, for super setting.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.540]   So super setting is an idea that says like, wait a minute, you're telling me, dude, I
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.740]   got to take five minutes in between each set.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.460]   Well, that's not so much a problem nowadays with phone, with smartphones, because people
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.660]   are filling their interset intervals with social media and texting.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.660]   Correct.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.980]   You don't really have to go that long.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.300]   In fact, there was actually a study that came out in the last month that showed, you know,
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.940]   like really two minutes is probably sufficient for most people.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.660]   Having said that, if you really are trying to push maximum strength adaptations, like
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.380]   three to five is very, very reasonable.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.900]   Those training sessions are long because you have to take, you're spending more time not
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.240]   doing anything than you are doing something, but you're trying to maximize quality.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.220]   So that's just sort of like part and parcel.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.500]   If you're not super worried about it, you can actually do super setting, which is, let's
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.580]   imagine again, you're going to do some lunges and while your legs are resting, doing their
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.620]   three to five minutes, you can go over and do an upper body row or pull.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.540]   And when your upper body's resting, you're going back to legs.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.980]   So that really cuts your time in half.
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.980]   Is it ideal?
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.980]   No.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.140]   We actually ran a study maybe 10 years ago in our lab and we looked at that specifically.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.620]   And we did see a reduction in strength performance in the super setting group relative to the
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.860]   group who do not super set.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.520]   The question then it becomes like, is it enough for you to care?
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.700]   So if you were to, if I were to say, Hey, I can cut an hour off of your workout time,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.840]   but you will lose 5% of your strength gain, almost everyone would take that exchange.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.700]   With the exception of people who are getting close to competition or really trying to set
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.220]   a new lifetime PR or something, then you might say, no, I don't want any interference there.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.480]   That last little margin is what I care about.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.860]   Give me the extra rest.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.860]   Great.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.260]   So it's not a, does it work?
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.260]   Does it not work?
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.420]   It's always a, what are you willing to give up versus get.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.320]   The practicalities of super setting or staggering push, pull, push, pull, uh, in my mind are
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.240]   real because you have to take over large segments of the gym, which oftentimes leads to a situation
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.520]   where your rest times are too long or highly variable because people are working in or
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   you can't finish your set.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.640]   Cause now someone jumped into the machine, right?
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640]   Totally screwed.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.360]   You lose three to five of your friends because it's obnoxious when you're taking over all
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   the equipment.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.560]   But in all seriousness, I think, um, it's wonderful if you have the space and the, and
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.780]   the format to do it.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.880]   But at least in my experience and observation, um, these people know who they are.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.600]   Uh, it's not practical to do on a regular basis if you train in an open commercial gym.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   Tough to pull off.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.420]   So, um, we've covered choice, order, volume and intensity to a sufficient level.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.060]   The last one is frequency.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.100]   And we've already sort of indirectly talked about that where frequency can be as high
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.940]   as you'd like in this area.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.260]   It really depends on your recovery.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.900]   If you're really, truly pushing maximum strength, you probably do need a few days to recover,
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.140]   although that's dependent upon you.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.460]   But speed and power can be done multiple times a day, almost every day, basically.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.320]   Um, the one exception would be maximum sprinting speed.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.860]   You need to be careful there for things like hamstring, uh, and injury, especially if you're
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.860]   pretty fast.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.620]   So you want to be a little bit cautious of that.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.740]   But if you're doing easier movements, um, like medicine ball throws or kettlebell swings
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.460]   or something, you could do those quite often as long as the volume is, is staying pretty
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.060]   low.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.980]   Last little piece here is progression.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.940]   How do I progress over time?
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.780]   So I mentioned this earlier, but just want to fill this gap right back in before we head
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:00.580]   over to hypertrophy, which is three to 5% increase per week of intensity in general.
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.020]   Um, and you can do upwards of about 5% increase in volume per week over time.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:10.820]   And I generally recommend running that for, uh, at longest eight weeks, but probably most
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.040]   realistically you want to go about five weeks or so, and then have some sort of a deload
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.320]   or back off week.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.820]   If you do that, you're not, you're generally going to be a pretty good spot.
