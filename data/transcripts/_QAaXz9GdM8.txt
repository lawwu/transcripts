[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.400]   in Paul's epistle to the Galatians, the first chapter, verses 21 to 24.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.000]   Verses 21 to 24 in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.180]   "Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, and was unknown by face unto
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.880]   the churches of Judea which were in Christ.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:41.000]   But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.500]   which once he destroyed; and they glorified God in me.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.520]   But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.720]   which once he destroyed; and they glorified God in me."
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:18.240]   In those words the apostle gives us a brief and summary account of his conversion, of
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.920]   the way in which he became a Christian.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.120]   Now this, I think, judged from any standpoint whatsoever, must be admitted, is one of the
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.280]   great and important events in the whole history of the human race.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720]   It's one of those climactic events, if you like.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.920]   It's even one of those great turning points in history, which leaves everything, in a
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.280]   sense, different from what it was before.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.320]   This man is undoubtedly one of the greatest men that the world has ever known.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.720]   Now that isn't simply my opinion.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.840]   It isn't simply the opinion of the Christian Church of him.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.080]   A few years ago, just at the end of the war, a series of lectures were organized by one
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.680]   of the greatest learned societies here in the City of London.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.480]   They organized a series of lectures on the theme "The Master Minds of the World."
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.240]   And they, not claiming to be specifically Christian, or in any way particularly interested
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.160]   in Christians, because they had lectures delivered by learned men, and many who were not Christians
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.880]   at all and never had been Christians, but they themselves decided that in the course
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.520]   of these lectures, one lecture should be devoted to this particular man, the apostle Paul.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.840]   The secular world, therefore, I say, does have to admit and to agree and to grant that
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.640]   he is one of the great master minds of the world.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.180]   And of course that has to be granted for this reason, that you judge a mind and you judge
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:28.400]   a master mind not only in terms of what it has produced in the way of literature and
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.320]   an exposition of its understanding of life, but also, and in particular perhaps, by the
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:47.760]   effect which that teaching has had upon society and upon the life of the world as a whole.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.400]   And judged again from that standpoint, it just has to be admitted that this man, the
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.760]   apostle Paul, and his preaching and his teaching have proved to be one of the greatest influences
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.320]   in the life of mankind.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.200]   You can only read the book of the Acts of the Apostles and you will see at once what
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.600]   I mean.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.440]   It was as the result of this man's missionary journeys that Christian churches were planted
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.380]   in various parts of Asia, and then he crossed over to Europe, and he began that great movement
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.960]   of the Christian church in Europe which has led to such astounding results.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:36.000]   And that of course has been one of the great, if not the greatest, factors in the long history
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.200]   of civilization and of the march of the human race.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.600]   So that I say that whatever our actual interest may be, whether we are Christian or not, we
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.800]   have got to agree that that event which took place in the life of this man, when going
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:05.520]   down from Jerusalem to Damascus, he suddenly underwent that great change that led to these
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.560]   profound consequences at which he hints in this brief statement.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.080]   Where he went down, you remember, as a Jew, as a Pharisee, persecuting.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.720]   And you remember that having met on the road the risen Lord Jesus Christ, this tremendous
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:36.120]   thing took place in him, and he became thereafter the Apostle Paul, the preacher of the gospel,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.940]   especially to the Gentiles.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.760]   Now then I say that this is a very important event, and it's worthy of our consideration
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   therefore.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.120]   All men and women who are interested in life and in the movement of thought, and in tracing
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.880]   why things have happened in history, and using such knowledge in order to try to forecast
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.640]   the future, and to influence the present, and so on, they must of necessity be interested
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   in this man.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.320]   He is an example, and he is a pattern.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.920]   Now there are many ways of looking at this question, and it is one of the glories of
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.040]   the Bible that it presents us with these different ways.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.000]   There are passages here with direct teaching, which argue it out before us, which put up
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.280]   the positions and then show their error, and then present us with the truth.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   And we thank God for them, and it's our business to study them.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.760]   But all that is supplemented at times by some of these personal illustrations.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.360]   And we are all interested in people.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.520]   We are interested in seeing a thing in action.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.400]   And that is why I'm asking your attention tonight to this case of the conversion of
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.920]   this man Saul of Tarsus, who became eventually the Apostle Paul.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.160]   Now let's look at this man for a moment.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.320]   Look at the work which the man accomplished.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.240]   Look at him as he travels up and down various parts of the then known civilized world.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.600]   Look at him traveling day and night, traveling over land and over sea, suffering shipwreck
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:23.720]   and hardships, and always with this intention of preaching, out to help people, out to bring
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.880]   them into a knowledge of God, and he gives himself and he weeps over them.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.320]   His tremendous work as an evangelist.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.200]   Look at his zeal.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.640]   Look at his energy.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.760]   Consider his enthusiasm.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.200]   See him going to places where he knew for certain that he'd be persecuted, and yet
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   he persists.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.400]   So anxious is he to give them the message.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.720]   And then consider his extraordinary humility.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.120]   This man who was honored of God and of Christ in this signal manner on the road to Damascus.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.960]   This man who is called to be the apostle to the Gentiles, preeminent.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.800]   What a humble man he was.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   How self-effacing.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.980]   Oh, you can't look at him and at these various portraits of him which you find in the book
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.120]   of Acts and which peep out occasionally in his own letters.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.920]   You can't, I say, look at him without realizing that you're in the presence of a very great
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.160]   man, a very great figure, a very great personality.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.360]   And yet, how humble he is.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.760]   He tells us that he went to Corinth in weakness, fear, and much trembling.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.920]   Apparently, there was not much to look at.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:47.020]   Some people said of him that his presence is weak and that his speech is contemptible.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   And he didn't object to that.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.420]   He was always so humble.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.380]   It's a quality that we admire in all persons.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:01.620]   And then look for a moment at the joy that the man had and the happiness that he experienced.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.940]   You can't read the letters, I say, without catching something of its infectious happiness.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.460]   Here is a man who bursts forth into his hymns of praise and of thanksgiving.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.260]   Here is a man whose heart seems to be singing.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.700]   He's thrown into a prison with his traveling companion Silas, and what they do there at
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.900]   midnight is to pray and to sing praises unto God.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.100]   Haven't you always felt as you read his letters and as you read the accounts of him that the
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:40.500]   men seemed to have a happiness and a joy which were extraordinary?
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.540]   Or let me put that in a slightly different form by putting it like this.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.020]   Have you ever noticed his mastery of life?
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.940]   The way he was able to control all his circumstances?
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.900]   The greater difficulty in this world is to master life, isn't it?
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.380]   The trouble with all of us is that we are defeated by life.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.060]   We all set out with certain ideas, but before we've gone very far, we begin to discover
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.220]   and to find that life is influencing us and life is mastering us.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.340]   How almost impossible it is to keep to the ideal that you set for yourself.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.100]   It's very difficult not to be cynical in a world like this.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.860]   You see, when you do read these great biographies of the world's great men, don't you begin
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.300]   to notice that there is almost an inevitable decline in practically every one of them outside
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.780]   the Christian faith?
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:37.420]   How they begin to compromise, how the personal element comes in, how the rewards of office,
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.860]   how success, how public applause, and all these things begin to play upon them and they
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.860]   hardly ever end as they begin.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.700]   They've lost something.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.620]   Life has mastered them.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:57.140]   It's true of all of us, whatever our position, whatever our setting in life, it's very difficult
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.380]   to steer your own course.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.180]   It's a very difficult thing to be master of your own fate.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.780]   It's an almost impossible thing, I say, to be independent of circumstances and surroundings
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.580]   and conditions and the things that happen to you.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.380]   And yet this man achieved it.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.540]   I've already referred to him in the prison.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:25.420]   His feet were put fast in the stocks, but he still goes on praying and singing praises
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.260]   unto God.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.020]   Indeed he tells us specifically in his letter to the Philippians, one of the most astounding
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.340]   things that a mortal man has ever said in this world, "I have learned in whatsoever
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.140]   state I am therein to be content.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.980]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.660]   I know both how to be abased and how to abound."
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.060]   The man is a master of life.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.780]   He's a master of circumstances.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:01.860]   Let me show you this same man one afternoon, standing in the presence of a very distinguished
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.100]   company of people.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:09.580]   A Roman governor called Festus with a king called Agrippa and his wife Bernice.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:16.700]   These great people are there seated upon their thrones, and they send for this man Paul,
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.780]   who was languishing in the prison at the time, and he's ushered in into their presence,
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:32.140]   a man in his prison suit with chains hanging upon his hands, upon his wrists.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.500]   And do you remember what he said to them?
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.140]   He said, "I would to God that you and all who hear my words this day were almost and
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:48.860]   all together such as I am, apart from these bonds."
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.180]   He can look to them in their high positions, in their wealth, in their luxury, in their
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.740]   apparent freedom, and he, a prisoner with the chains hanging from his wrists, can say,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:08.020]   "I would to God that you were as I am."
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.700]   Stone bars do not a prison make, nor iron bars.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.220]   Stone walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.100]   It was true in this man's experience.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.980]   He lives above the circumstances.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.620]   He's independent of them.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.580]   He's mastered them all.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:32.860]   And wherever he is up or down with abundance or impenury, he's perfectly content and he's
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.860]   perfectly happy.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.780]   There's a poise and a balance and an equanimity about him that nothing can disturb.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:50.100]   Like the needle in your compass, he settles there fixed to the northern stars.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:56.440]   Oh, yes, but go on, take a final view of him.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.100]   Look at him as he faces death and as he faces eternity.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.040]   Look at him at the end of his life.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.780]   Look at him when he's become an old man before his time, owing to his energy and his preaching.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.780]   Look at him as he faces it all, as he knows he's about to be put to death.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.340]   What does he say?
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.180]   He says, "I have fought the good fight.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.780]   I have finished the faith."
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.180]   He's going on henceforth.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.620]   He says, "There is a crown laid up for me."
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.080]   Or listen to him putting the same truth in writing to the Philippians.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.380]   He said he's in a straight betwixt two, desiring to remain with them because that
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.900]   would be helpful for them.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:45.420]   But as for himself, his desire is to be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:52.380]   "For to me," he says, "to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.420]   Far from being afraid of death, he says, "It's a gain."
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.100]   It's something in a sense that he's looking forward to and he's anticipating.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.100]   He's not frightened.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.780]   He's not terrified by it.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.180]   He looks beyond it.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.740]   He knows where he's going.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.620]   He not only masters life and his present circumstances, he's already conquered death.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.100]   He's mastered the grave.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.100]   He sees through.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.100]   He sees beyond.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.660]   That's the man we're looking at.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:26.100]   Or consider it, if you like, in terms of the blessing that he was to others.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.820]   See those members of the church at Ephesus going to bid farewell to him on one occasion
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.340]   and how they loved him and how they wept when he told them that they'd never see his face
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.340]   again.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.780]   Why, well, he'd brought them something that was greater than life.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.380]   He'd brought them a happiness and a joy and a peace and a mastery of life as well.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.300]   It was through his lips they'd heard the blessed good news.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.820]   Was there ever such a benefactor to mankind?
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.220]   He was a blessing wherever he was sent by his Lord and Master.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.660]   That's the sort of life he lived as a Christian.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.460]   Well now, my friends, the question I want to ask is this.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.860]   What was the secret of all that?
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.020]   Or let me ask another question.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.020]   Wouldn't you like to be like that?
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.220]   Wouldn't you like to live that sort of life?
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.220]   Wouldn't you like to have this man's peace, his joy, his happiness?
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.100]   Wouldn't you like to have this ability which he had to be independent of everything that
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.460]   happened to him?
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.020]   Wouldn't you like to feel that death and its terrors have gone as far as you were concerned,
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.180]   that you know God and you know Christ?
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.980]   Wouldn't you like to live this kind of life?
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.940]   Wouldn't you like to be a great public benefactor?
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.620]   Wouldn't you like to be such a person that people weep as they think they'll never see
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.700]   you again and feel they owe everything to you and would give their very eyes for you?
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.140]   These Galatians, it seems, were ready to do that.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.660]   Now the Apostle's answer to these questions is that this is something which is possible
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:07.260]   for us all, that we can all be like this because he was like this, he tells us, because he
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.140]   was a Christian.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.520]   That's the sole explanation.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.440]   That is one of his greatest messages.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:22.460]   The Apostle Paul lived that kind of life and was that kind of person for that sole reason.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.620]   It wasn't a matter of temperament.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.060]   It wasn't that he happened to be born in that particular way and had got that kind
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.060]   of nature.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.860]   He goes out of his way to tell us, even here, that he used to be very different.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.460]   He wasn't always like this.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.940]   You see, being a Christian is not a matter of temperament or of psychology.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.220]   It isn't a question of having a religious complex and you either have it or you haven't
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.220]   got it.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.220]   No, no.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:54.460]   What he says is that all can have this if they desire it.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.320]   It wasn't his temperament.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   It wasn't his psychology.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.700]   It wasn't his makeup that accounts for it.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.940]   Or neither was it due to the fact that he'd always lived a good life and so on.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.620]   I don't want to stay with that this evening.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.500]   I may return to that.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.860]   But at any rate, let me say it hurriedly in passing.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:17.700]   He reminds us here, doesn't he, that there was a time when he'd been very different
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:25.020]   indeed, when he had once persecuted everything that made him the man that he became, when
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.820]   he hated it and was violent in his opposition to it.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.260]   That's his great message to us.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.900]   He tells Timothy the thing quite explicitly when he says that God has set me forth as
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.420]   an example, he says, that all may know that if I could ever become like this, then all
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.900]   can become like that.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:51.860]   Therefore, I say that this is the most important study.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:57.460]   I ask again, wouldn't you like to be like this man?
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:04.340]   Wouldn't you like to feel that you'd really conquered life in this world and that as you
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.820]   go on through it, instead of losing something day by day and gradually sinking into a state
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:15.020]   of hopelessness, your joy rather increases, your happiness becomes greater, your peace
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:21.020]   knows no bounds and no limit, things and the world and everything hold you less and less,
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.100]   and you know where you're going and to whom you're going, and the brightness increases
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.820]   and the glory becomes more marvelous and wonderful.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:39.100]   Well, the answer is, I say, that we should know exactly what it is that makes one a Christian.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:44.340]   And I'm repeating it and emphasizing it for this good reason.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:51.180]   It is our failure to understand this, my friends, that stands between us and knowing such a
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.060]   life and experiencing such a life and living such a life.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:01.500]   Oh, it's this tragic misunderstanding of what a Christian is and what makes a man a Christian.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.020]   It's this false idea, this other gospel, says Paul, which isn't the gospel.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.220]   That's the trouble.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.620]   It's all this false teaching as to what makes a man a Christian.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.900]   No, no, if we want to live this kind of life, we must know something of this experience
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.980]   through which this man passed.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:25.380]   Now let me make one thing perfectly clear before I come to my analysis.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.140]   There are things that are vital and essential to conversion.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.300]   There are things which are incidental.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   Now in the case of the Apostle, it was a most dramatic event.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.740]   The dramatic aspect is not at all essential.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.180]   That isn't of necessity something that must take place.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.540]   You and I are not likely to see the risen Lord looking at us from the heavens as he
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.180]   looked at Paul on the road to Damascus.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.180]   That isn't essential.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.140]   There have been millions of Christians who have never seen him like that, but they've
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.860]   had the same essential experience.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:02.980]   Therefore I say, let's not be misled by the dramatic aspects of this great event.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.420]   It's the principle that matters.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.060]   You talk to numbers of Christian people and you'll find that as they relate their experience,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.420]   the details differ tremendously.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.740]   Some have felt some very tremendous emotion and others have felt much less emotion.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.940]   These things vary, but there are certain things that are absolute.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:29.140]   And it is to them that I'm anxious to direct attention.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.540]   How did this man become a Christian?
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.180]   What's the secret of this life which he lived?
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.500]   How can we become like him?
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   What is it?
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.980]   Well, the first thing I would say is this.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:52.700]   It means that something happens to us and that God deals with us.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.580]   I must start with this.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:00.340]   Christianity, my dear friend, is not something that you and I take up.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.700]   It is something that takes us up.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.980]   No, no, we can't be detached.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.820]   We can't look on it from the outside and in an external manner as something that we can
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.900]   be interested in and something we decide to go in for or not to go in for.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.380]   No, no, it isn't that.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:23.540]   It is, I say, essentially something that happens to us.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.940]   It means God dealing with us.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.740]   God dealt with this man.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.460]   He's constantly repeating it.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:38.580]   He says, "When it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:46.620]   his grace to reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles," and so on.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.820]   God dealt with the man.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.660]   God intervened in his life.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.700]   And this is something I say that is invariable in the case of all who become Christian.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.980]   They are aware of God dealing with them.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.100]   Now I'm addressing those who claim to be Christians and some probably who do not claim
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.260]   to be Christians, but I put this question to all.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:16.900]   Whether you profess to be a Christian or not, do you know that God has dealt with you?
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.940]   It is fundamental to the Christian.
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:25.140]   You see, you can join a church and be a member without God ever having done anything to you.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.060]   That isn't a Christian.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.980]   You can decide to join a church.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:30.980]   That doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.020]   The thing is, has God dealt with you?
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.260]   It's this work of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:45.500]   Oh yes, let me put it to you in ways that it has been put by different men.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:51.340]   It's this idea, you know, that Francis Thompson has when he talks about the hand of heaven,
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.540]   of a presence that wouldn't leave him alone, and he says, "I fled him down the nights
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.580]   and down the days."
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.940]   He couldn't get rid of him.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.940]   He wanted to do certain things, but he was conscious as if a hound were after him and
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.180]   wouldn't leave him alone and was ever coming after him.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.620]   Do you know anything about that?
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.540]   It's a vital, essential part of the Christian experience.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:21.740]   An awareness that God is dealing with you and disturbing you and coming into your life.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:27.580]   Oh yes, listen to George Methusel saying the same thing, "Oh love that won't not let
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.740]   me go."
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.340]   How often did he try to shake him off?
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:39.180]   "But oh love that won't not let me go."
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.820]   He follows, he's interested, he disturbs, he deals with us.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:49.100]   My friends, let me again emphasize this.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:56.780]   The ways in which he does it are almost endless, and I'm not concerned to emphasize the particular
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:05.420]   way, but God comes and intervenes in our lives in an almost endless number of ways.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:12.460]   Any feeling of dissatisfaction you ever have with yourself, it's God dealing with you.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:18.100]   Any desire within you for something better, something purer, something cleaner.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.420]   Any sense of shame, it's God dealing with you.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.320]   It's the spirit of God striving within you.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.820]   He does that.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.620]   And all this means God's interference in your life.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.220]   You're conscious that God won't leave you alone.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.780]   You wish you could get rid of it.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.840]   You wished you'd never heard of him sometimes.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.380]   You may perhaps in your youth be glad that you're going away from home and to a city
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.420]   where nobody will know you, and you think, "Now then, I can live as I want to live."
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.020]   You've left your father and mother behind, you've left your family behind, but you suddenly
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.100]   discover that God isn't left behind.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:57.180]   He's still there, and he still goes on speaking to you.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.500]   Like the men who'd wandered far away from home and far away from his upbringing and
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.340]   his early traditions, and who'd plunged here in the city of London into a life of sin and
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.780]   was hell bound, when suddenly one night on the embankment, even meditating suicide, he
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:18.140]   heard Big Ben striking nine, and remembered that his father and mother were probably praying
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.140]   for him.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.460]   He couldn't get away from him.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.860]   God, the Hound of Heaven, was dealing with him.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.940]   Well, that was what happened to Paul.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.820]   It always happens to anyone, I say, who becomes a Christian.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.780]   It's this activity of God upon the soul.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.220]   My friend, have you felt it?
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.220]   Have you known it?
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.780]   Have you been aware of it?
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.940]   I take it that the very fact that you're in this service at this moment means that you
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.700]   do know something about it.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.260]   You may even have come against your will, but you've come.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.260]   Why?
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.980]   Well, there was something compelling, something you couldn't resist, something gnawing at
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.300]   the vitals of your soul.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.020]   It's God.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.700]   Something happens to us.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:14.580]   God deals with us, and we are conscious that we are in his hands, and that he's doing something
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.580]   to us.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.580]   Here it is.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.940]   It's always true.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.620]   But let me hurry to my second point, which is this.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.340]   It means a complete change.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.020]   This is how he puts it here.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:34.260]   He says that he was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ, but
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.020]   they had heard only, this is all they knew about him, that he which persecuted us in
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:49.420]   times past now, preaches the faith that once he destroyed, times past now.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.260]   And what an absolute change.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:59.460]   What an entire change, a complete change.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.780]   I needn't labour this point, need I?
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:08.220]   What a difference there was between Saul of Tarsus and the apostle Paul.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.900]   It wasn't a partial change.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.460]   It wasn't an incomplete change.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.460]   It wasn't something transitional.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.460]   No, no.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.460]   This thing is, there it is.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.460]   It's absolute.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.460]   There he was.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.460]   There he is.
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.100]   He was a man of principles, persecuting, violent, pouring of blasphemy as it were, against the
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:31.060]   Christ of God, preaching.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:36.060]   One either is or is not a Christian.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.040]   There is no mean between opposites, says Aristotle.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:47.220]   And there is no mean between not being a Christian and being a Christian.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.020]   There's no such thing as almost being a Christian.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.820]   If you're simply almost a Christian, you're not a Christian.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.860]   You either are or you're not.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.860]   Why?
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:02.380]   Well, because you see, this point that I've already been emphasising, establishes it.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.740]   It's God doing something.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.460]   This man's whole personality was changed.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.220]   He became an entirely different man.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.020]   And here he tells us something about it.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:23.220]   You see, he was affected in his mind and in his heart and in his will.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.620]   The whole person is involved in this.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.700]   You see, there isn't such a thing as being a Christian in your mind only, and not in
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.460]   your heart and not in your will.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.580]   That's not being a Christian.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.540]   That's having an intellectual interest in Christianity.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.620]   That's being interested in the Christian philosophy.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.780]   That isn't being a Christian.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.700]   You see, the people like that really don't know it, they don't experience it, and therefore
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.820]   they're not masters of circumstances as Paul was.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.500]   You can have a theoretical interest.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.580]   That isn't what I'm talking about.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:58.380]   I'm talking about being a Christian.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.460]   You can take up a certain amount of the Christian ethic in your life and that'll make you very
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.460]   moral.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:08.700]   But that, again, isn't being a Christian.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.540]   You can have emotional experiences, but that in and of itself doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:19.020]   No, no, the Christian is a man whose whole being is involved, his mind, his heart, and
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.380]   his will, the entire man.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.500]   In other words, as the scriptures put it, he's a new creature.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.940]   He's a new creation.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.100]   He really is as different as the apostle depicts here.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.540]   There he was in times past, now.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.540]   And the difference is almost incredible.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:41.060]   Indeed, if you read the story in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you will find
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.620]   that certain Christian people in Jerusalem, they couldn't believe this.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.500]   They said, "This thing is impossible.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.540]   We can't believe that that man's a Christian.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.540]   The thing is unthinkable.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.140]   Don't you remember what he was like?"
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.900]   They were very doubtful about accepting him and receiving him.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:01.380]   The change was so dramatic, it was so total.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:08.700]   And as he here indicates to us, it's a change in a man's view of the past.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.740]   You see, in the past he thought that he was living a very good life.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.340]   He now came to see that it was a terrible life.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.980]   His view of the past is entirely different.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.140]   His view of the present is entirely different.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.100]   He isn't doing what he thought he would be doing at that time.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.220]   His view of the future, as I've shown you, is absolutely revolutionized completely from
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.580]   beginning to end.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.300]   So what is this?
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.420]   It is nothing less than receiving a new life.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.420]   That's Christianity.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:46.820]   Christianity, as I'm never tired of quoting the phrase, the title of the book of that
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:53.700]   Scotsman, Henry Scougal, who lived in the 17th century, "Christianity is the life of
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:58.700]   God in the souls of men."
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.700]   And a Christian is nothing less than that.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.100]   My friends, this is an absolute difference.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.900]   It isn't the natural man, it isn't the ordinary man with something added on.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   It's a new man.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.900]   It's a new creature.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.900]   It's a new being.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.220]   It's the difference between Saul of Tarsus and the apostle Paul.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.220]   Something that wasn't there has come into being.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.460]   It's astounding, it's amazing.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:27.420]   Again as Paul puts it in the second chapter of this very epistle to the Galatians, "It
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:38.580]   is as great a change as this, that he is able to say, 'I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.580]   in me.'"
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.860]   It's as different as that.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.180]   But let me go on to my next point, which I'll put in this form.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:52.420]   This new life, this new life which results from this great change, is something that
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:57.220]   dominates and controls us.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.580]   After the apostle had undergone this change, this is what happened to him.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:08.660]   He which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:16.260]   He is being controlled by something which is entirely new and absolutely different.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:22.220]   In other words, Christianity is not something that you take up and put down at will.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.060]   It isn't something that you decide, I say, to handle and to apply when you think fit.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:33.780]   No, no, to be a Christian means this, that you're dominated by this life which you've
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.780]   received.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.380]   You don't manipulate it, it manipulates you.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:44.300]   It determines your life and your living and your activity and everything else.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.740]   Here is a man clearly, as you look at the apostle Paul, who is being controlled by this
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.420]   new life.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.900]   It's got him in its grip.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.820]   They asked him one day why he preached so much, and the only answer that he could give
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:07.540]   was this, "Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:12.380]   The love of Christ, he says, constraineth me.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.140]   I'm like a man in a vice.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.940]   I'm not controlling myself.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.820]   The pressure, as it were, is being put upon me.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.540]   The screw is being tightened up.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.060]   I can't help myself.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.900]   The love of Christ constraineth me.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.580]   I'm mastered by it.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.100]   He was held by it and controlled by it.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.100]   It moved him.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.100]   It drove him.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.100]   It urged him.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.860]   He's no longer in control of himself.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:39.660]   This controls him."
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.820]   That's the kind of change it is.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.300]   And that, my friends, is Christianity.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.380]   That is what it means to be a Christian.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.620]   That your life is dominated by this thing, that you're controlled by this thing.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.100]   Oh, I'll say again how different it is from what people imagine Christianity to be so
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.340]   frequently.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:08.100]   How many there are who think that the Christian is really a man of the world like everybody
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:13.420]   else except that he pays an occasional visit to a church on a Sunday morning?
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.420]   It's a part of the social round, and that's Christianity.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.620]   It's just this odd thing that he does now and again.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.820]   The main book of his life is identical with that of others, and they're rather amazed
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.060]   and surprised that he still troubles to do this.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.500]   But many a man regards that as true Christianity.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.420]   You see, he picks it up, puts it down, just when he pleases and as he chooses.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.740]   That isn't the Christianity that this man knew.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.460]   This isn't the kind of Christian he's talking about.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.460]   He's mastered.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.460]   He's controlled.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.460]   He's perfected.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.460]   It's everything.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:54.380]   And there he is preaching the faith that he once persecuted.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:01.340]   There is no value in a Christian profession unless your life is controlled by it, unless
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:08.940]   your thinking is controlled by it, unless your practice is controlled by it.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.900]   What is it that controls your thought, my friend?
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.660]   Your outlook upon men and upon God and upon life and the world?
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:19.780]   Is it what you read in books or is it this?
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.780]   What is it that controls our behavior and our conduct in detail?
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:29.780]   To be Christian means that all along the line, this is the thing that controls us and masters
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.320]   us and guides us.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.340]   And then I must mention the last thing, which is this.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.980]   It is a change that others can see in us.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.460]   These churches, he tells us, had never seen his face.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:51.060]   All they had heard was this, that he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.420]   faith which once he destroyed.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.380]   And they glorified God in me.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.780]   They knew that something had happened to him.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.820]   They were aware of a change in him.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.820]   It was obvious.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.820]   It was evident.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.820]   It was irresistible.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:08.420]   They glorified God because of this.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:13.500]   There was no need to argue as to whether Saul of Tarsus had become a Christian or not.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.660]   Everybody knew that he had.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.100]   The whole world knew that he had.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.140]   And my dear friends, according to this New Testament Christianity, when a man becomes
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.660]   a Christian, everybody knows it.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.660]   You can't conceal it.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.660]   You can't hide it.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.660]   It's irresistible.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660]   It's obvious.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.940]   It stares you in the face.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:39.700]   I was telling the friends in a little meeting that we had in this church on Thursday night
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:45.940]   something that I feel constrained to repeat to you.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:55.000]   Fifty years ago, last Wednesday evening, in other words on the 29th of September, 1904,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.080]   something happened to a man called Evan Roberts in South Wales which led to the revival of
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:11.520]   1904 and 5 when thousands of men and women underwent this very change and experience
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.280]   which I'm trying to describe to you tonight.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:21.400]   When the Spirit of God came upon them and changed them, I told them about a doctor whom
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:27.000]   I knew and who didn't claim to be much of a Christian, told me himself how he saw men
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   going into a meeting on a Saturday night blind drunk and saw him sobbed in a second and going
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.560]   out as a saint.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:45.560]   But what I wanted to tell you again was this, that large numbers of men working as miners
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:52.640]   underground underwent this same change and everybody knew that it had happened to them.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.720]   Yes, and as I told the friends on Thursday night, the pit ponies knew it.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   And the pit ponies showed that they knew it in a very remarkable way.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.960]   The pit ponies became very unruly.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.840]   It was very difficult to handle them.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.840]   Why?
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.980]   The reason was this.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.320]   The only instructions that they'd ever known and had been accustomed to were cursing and
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.680]   swearing and blasphemy and kicks and being beaten with sticks and with ropes.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.200]   That was the treatment they'd had.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:31.160]   And when these men were changed, as Saul of Tarsus was changed, began to speak kindly
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:39.160]   to them and to ask them and to urge them quietly to go on, they didn't understand the language.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.640]   The men had become Christians.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.320]   And not only did their friends and associates know it, the pit ponies knew it.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:53.960]   Ah, my friend, when this thing happens, when God gives his life to you and when you become
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.160]   a new man, you must be different and the whole world will know it and they'll glorify God
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.960]   in you because you're different.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:08.100]   You know you're different and everybody else knows that you're different.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.400]   The last thing I want to say this evening can be put in this brief way.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.920]   All that I've been describing results from one thing only.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.600]   What's that?
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.440]   It is a new attitude towards the Christian faith.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.600]   Have you noticed it as I've repeated it?
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   Listen.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.080]   And I was unknown by faith unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ, but they had
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:43.360]   heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   he destroyed.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.320]   That's the thing that accounts for all the difference.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.240]   That's the thing that made the apostle Paul the man he was and gave him his mastery of
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.960]   life and circumstances and his conquest of the death and the grave.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:03.800]   The faith which once he had destroyed and persecuted he now preaches and advocates and
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:14.560]   commends it with all the intensity of his emotional being and his master mind.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.160]   So you see it isn't just an experience.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:27.720]   It is an experience that results from a new attitude towards this faith.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   What is this?
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.440]   Well he's told us in this chapter already.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.840]   He started off with it.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:39.880]   "Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:45.480]   for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.640]   of God and our Father to whom be glory forever and ever.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   Amen."
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   That's it.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.400]   He, as I'm going to show you, God willing on some other Sunday evening, he believed
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.080]   he could put himself right by obeying the law and doing this and that and being religious.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.760]   He saw it was all wrong and here is everything.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.680]   This Christ to me derided.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.080]   This Christ to me regarded as a blasphemer.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.360]   This Christ to me persecuted and all his followers.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:23.080]   He sees he's the Son of God and the Savior of his soul and the Savior of the world.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:28.360]   The cross which he regarded as a stumbling block and an offense, something to be ridiculed
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.640]   and to be laughed out of court, he sees as the most glorious event in history.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:39.240]   The Son of God taking his sins upon himself and bearing their punishment and dying for
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.920]   them and rising again to justify him so that he cries out at the end of this very epistle,
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:52.720]   "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.200]   He had gloried in his Jewish blood.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.040]   He had gloried in the tribe to which he belonged.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.640]   He had gloried in the fact that he was a Pharisee and Amaliel's favorite pupil.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.280]   He dismisses it all.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:15.600]   "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:21.240]   So that my dear friend, the final question is this.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.080]   What's your reaction to this faith?
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:34.180]   The faith which proclaims that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:42.120]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.120]   That's the faith.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.640]   "Don't listen to any other," says Paul.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.880]   "I marvel that you have so soon removed from him that called you unto the grace of Christ
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.800]   and to another gospel which is not another.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.240]   But there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.080]   But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.520]   we have preached, let him be accursed."
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:16.080]   There is but one faith and it's this, that no man can save himself or make himself acceptable
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.320]   in the sight of God.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:27.600]   But that God has sent his only Son into the world to redeem us and he came and suffered
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:34.800]   our death and our penalty and was buried and rose again and revealed himself and sent his
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:41.240]   Holy Spirit that you and I might be forgiven, that we might have this new life, that Christ
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.920]   might come and change us and make us like Paul and make us like himself.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   That's the faith.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.560]   The faith that he'd hated and derided, he preaches it.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:45:01.440]   He knows it's God's Word and God's power unto salvation to every one that believeth.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.400]   God revealed it unto this man, Saul of Tarsus, in that signal and striking manner on the
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.200]   road to Damascus.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.080]   He doesn't do that to all, I say.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:19.120]   His way of doing it is simply, "I say to his glory."
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:27.560]   And with a sense of my utter inadequacy, he does it by calling simple little men like
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:35.520]   myself to stand in a pulpit like this and just make the pronouncement and the proclamation
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.720]   that God has done that.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.920]   He's revealing it through my preaching.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:49.480]   He's telling you this exactly as he told it to Saul of Tarsus.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:46:00.600]   And he adds what Paul was always careful to say, that unless we believe it and know something
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:08.120]   of this change which I've been describing to you, we are yet in our sins, we belong
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   to the world, we are strangers and enemies of God, and the wrath of God abideth upon
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.400]   us.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:25.240]   My friend, I ask you, not only would you like to be like Paul and live the kind of life
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:35.600]   he did, but I would ask you this, do you realize that if you're not a possessor of this life
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:45.160]   of God in your soul, this Christian life, that you're outside the blessing of God?
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:52.880]   And that if you die like that, you will spend an eternity of misery and wretchedness and
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:02.080]   shame and you will have no excuse, for you have heard the faith which opens to you the
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:11.040]   door of forgiveness, of reconciliation, of life anew and sonship, and joy in the presence
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.040]   of God.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:21.960]   Oh, I beseech you, as you confront this faith, imitate and emulate the example of the Apostle
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   Paul.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.800]   He puts it like this, "I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision."
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.240]   Follow him, obey it, yield yourself to it.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.200]   You will never make yourself like this man.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.960]   You will never produce this Christian life.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.840]   God will give it to you.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:53.840]   If you repent and confess your sin and your failure and wait upon him, turn to him and
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.360]   receive it.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   Amen.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.920]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
