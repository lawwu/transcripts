[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.560]   Big news from the United States for those who have student loans.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.000]   It seems probable, based upon yesterday's announcement by President Biden, it seems
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.480]   probable that if you have student loans, federal student loans, and if you earn under $125,000
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.600]   per year, that some portion, up to 10, or in some cases $20,000 of your loans, will
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.760]   be reduced, forgiven, canceled by the federal government.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.460]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.960]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and today we're going to talk about this student loan news.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.200]   First, I want to go over what it actually means, a fact sheet of what's actually happening,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.400]   what the government says it's going to do, what are the rules for qualifying.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.200]   We'll talk a little bit about planning ideas.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.800]   Are there some financial planning ideas that you can implement or things that you can do
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.720]   to make sure that you get the most government money that you can?
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.960]   And then number three, we'll talk about general response and reaction to this.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.840]   What does this mean in terms of a social context, a political context?
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.720]   What does this mean for people who have paid off their loans, et cetera?
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.800]   So let's begin by reading the fact sheet published at whitehouse.gov.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.840]   Fact sheet, President Biden announces student loan relief for borrowers who need it most.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.920]   A three-part plan delivers on President Biden's promise to cancel $10,000 of student debt
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.280]   for low to middle income borrowers.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.200]   President Biden believes that a post-high school education should be a ticket to a middle
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.560]   class life.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.840]   But for too many, the cost of borrowing for college is a lifelong burden that deprives
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.080]   them of that opportunity.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.720]   During the campaign, he promised to provide student debt relief.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.800]   Today, the Biden administration is following through on that promise and providing families
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.300]   breathing room as they prepare to start repaying loans after the economic crisis brought on
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.200]   by the pandemic.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   Since 1980, the total cost of both four-year public and four-year private college has nearly
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.160]   tripled even after accounting for inflation.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.840]   Federal support has not kept up.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.520]   Pell Grants once covered nearly 80 percent of the cost of a four-year public college
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.960]   degree for students from working families, but now only cover a third.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.440]   That has left many students from low and middle income families with no choice but to borrow
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.280]   if they want to get a degree.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.800]   According to a Department of Education analysis, the typical undergraduate student with loans
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.520]   now graduates with nearly $25,000 in debt.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.680]   The skyrocketing cumulative federal student loan debt, $1.6 trillion and rising for more
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.780]   than 45 million borrowers, is a significant burden on America's middle class.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.360]   Middle class borrowers struggle with high monthly payments and ballooning balances that
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.960]   make it harder for them to build wealth like buying homes, putting away money for retirement,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.480]   and starting small businesses.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.580]   For the most vulnerable borrowers, the effects of debt are even more crushing.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.440]   Nearly one-third of borrowers have debt but no degree.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.120]   According to an analysis by the Department of Education of a recent cohort of undergraduates,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.800]   many of these students could not complete their degree because the cost of attendance
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.560]   was too high.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.360]   About 16 percent of borrowers are in default, including nearly a third of senior citizens
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.440]   with student debt, which can result in the government garnishing a borrower's wages
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.960]   or lowering a borrower's credit score.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.560]   The student debt burden also falls disproportionately on black borrowers.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.660]   Twenty years after first enrolling in school, the typical black borrower who started college
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.400]   in the 1995-96 school year still owed 95 percent of their original student debt.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.920]   Today, President Biden is announcing a three-part plan to provide more breathing room to America's
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.480]   working families as they continue to recover from the strains associated with the COVID-19
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   pandemic.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   This plan offers targeted debt relief as part of a comprehensive effort to address the burden
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.360]   of growing college costs and make the student loan system more manageable for working families.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.160]   The President is announcing that the Department of Education will provide targeted debt relief
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.720]   to address the financial harms of the pandemic, fulfilling the President's campaign commitment.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.640]   The Department of Education will provide up to $20,000 in debt cancellation to Pell Grant
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.120]   recipients with loans held by the Department of Education and up to $10,000 in debt cancellation
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.800]   to non-Pell Grant recipients.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.160]   Borrowers are eligible for this relief if their individual income is less than $125,000
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.100]   or $250,000 for married couples.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.480]   No high-income individual or high-income household in the top 5 percent of incomes will benefit
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   from this action.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.680]   To ensure a smooth transition to repayment and prevent unnecessary defaults, the pause
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.640]   on federal student loan repayment will be extended one final time through December 31,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.460]   2022.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.560]   Borrowers should expect to resume payment in January 2023.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.880]   Make the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers by cutting
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.220]   monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.160]   The Department of Education is proposing a new income-driven repayment plan that protects
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.320]   more low-income borrowers from making any payments and caps monthly payments for undergraduate
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   loans at 5 percent of a borrower's discretionary incomeâ€”half of the rate that borrowers must
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.560]   pay now under most existing plans.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   This means that the average annual student loan payment will be lowered by more than
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.080]   $1,000 for both current and future borrowers.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.760]   Fixing the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program by proposing a rule that borrowers
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.880]   who have worked at a non-profit in the military or in federal, state, tribal, or local government
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.480]   receive appropriate credit toward loan forgiveness.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.640]   These improvements will build on temporary changes the Department of Education has already
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   made to PSLF, under which more than 175,000 public servants have already had more than
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   $10 billion in loan forgiveness approved.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.620]   And protect future students and taxpayers by reducing the cost of college and holding
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.400]   schools accountable when they hike up prices.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.720]   The President championed the largest increase to Pell Grants in over a decade, and one of
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   the largest one-time influxes to colleges and universities.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.880]   To further reduce the cost of college, the President will continue to fight to double
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   the maximum Pell Grant and make community college free.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.760]   Meanwhile, colleges have an obligation to keep prices reasonable and ensure borrowers
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.360]   get value for their investments, not debt they cannot afford.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.680]   This Administration has already taken key steps to strengthen accountability, including
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.800]   in areas where the previous Administration weakened rules.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.480]   The Department of Education is announcing new efforts to ensure student borrowers get
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.180]   value for their college costs.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.960]   And provide targeted debt relief, fulfilling the President's campaign commitment.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.660]   To address the financial harms of the pandemic for low- and middle-income borrowers and avoid
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.280]   defaults as loan repayment restarts next year, the Department of Education will provide up
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.520]   to $20,000 in loan relief to borrowers with loans held by the Department of Education,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:37.120]   whose individual income is less than $125,000 for married couples and who received a Pell
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120]   Grant.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.120]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120]   And blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.120]   Same old, same old.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   I think that's enough.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:51.060]   So you get the idea of the White House's press relief and propaganda piece there.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.160]   U.S. Department of Education, Biden-Harris Administration announces final student loan
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.740]   pause extension through December 31, and targeted debt cancellation to smooth transition to
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.740]   repayment.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.940]   It goes on with some details.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.900]   So in essence, what do you need to know?
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.500]   Well, let's read from the Wall Street Journal, "Student Loan Forgiveness, Who Qualifies for
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.180]   a Student Loan Forgiveness Plan and What It Means for Borrowers.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.540]   Millions of Americans with student debt stand to get relief.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.660]   President Biden's student loan plan will reduce or wipe out the debt of millions of
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.660]   borrowers.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.060]   The plan eliminates up to $10,000 in federal loan debt for individual borrowers with annual
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:34.480]   incomes of under $125,000 or couples who earn less than $250,000.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.300]   Many borrowers will be eligible for total forgiveness up to $20,000 if they received
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:45.500]   Pell Grants, a form of federal financial aid awarded to students from low-income households.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.780]   "We're in unprecedented territory," said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.020]   Student Loan Servicing Alliance.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.500]   "This has never been done before.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.660]   The plan is expected to benefit the majority of the more than 43 million people in the
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.660]   United States who hold a total of $1.6 trillion in student loan debt."
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.540]   Skipping down, a couple of questions.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.540]   Who is eligible?
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.540]   We've covered that.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.060]   You're eligible for $10,000 in relief if you earn less than $125,000 a year or $250,000
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.260]   a year for couples.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:20.860]   The income limit applies to gross adjusted income from 2021 or 2020.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.700]   People who received federal Pell Grants in college will also be eligible for up to $20,000
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.040]   in forgiveness.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.380]   Around 6 in 10 borrowers with any federal loans also received a Pell Grant, according
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.380]   to the White House.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:37.300]   And Pell Grant recipient graduates hold about $4,500 more in debt than other graduates,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.460]   according to a 2020 analysis.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.060]   When will forgiveness take effect?
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.860]   The timing remains uncertain, but the Education Department has promised more details in the
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:50.460]   weeks ahead, at minimum before student loan payments resume in January 2023.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.260]   Do I need to take action to receive debt relief?
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.260]   Not yet.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.500]   Wait until you receive a notification from your loan servicer, Mr. Buchanan said.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.260]   Beware of any friendly-sounding phone calls or suspicious-looking emails from addresses
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.180]   you don't recognize.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.180]   It's a very complicated process and it's going to take months to effectuate, he said.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.140]   Don't do anything until you see something happen to your account.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.660]   Meanwhile, double-check the information you've already shared with your loan servicer and
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.080]   the studentaid.gov website.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.420]   If you've recently moved or changed any contact information, you're going to want to make
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.460]   sure that they have the most up-to-date addresses, said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.540]   What if I have private student loans?
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.440]   Only federal debt is eligible.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.960]   What if the amount I owe is under $10,000?
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.780]   If you owe less than $10,000 on your loan, or $20,000 for those who received Pell Grants,
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.820]   then congratulations, you'll now be student debt-free.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.180]   President Biden's plan will wipe out the debt of around 15 million borrowers.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.300]   Is the pause on student loan payments extended?
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.780]   Before today's announcement, loan payments were expected to resume on August 31.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.300]   Now, borrowers will see the pause extended through the end of the year.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.820]   Interest accrual and collections remain on pause as well.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.100]   Are parent plus loans eligible?
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.660]   Yes, an individual student is limited in how much money they can take out on federal loans,
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.160]   but through the parent plus and grad plus programs, families can borrow the total cost
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.600]   of attendance, including room and board and other expenses.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   This forgiveness applies to federal loans for both undergraduate and graduate programs
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.100]   as well as to parent plus loans, White House officials said.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.220]   Is my debt forgiveness tax exempt?
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:31.080]   Debt forgiveness is often treated as income on taxes, but unfortunately for borrowers,
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.440]   this canceled student debt is federally tax exempt, as seen in other federal student debt
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.080]   forgiveness programs.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.220]   Under existing state laws, in as many as 13 states, student loan forgiveness could count
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:48.420]   as taxable income on state income tax returns, according to Jared Wolsak, blah blah blah.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.220]   What if I've already paid off my loans?
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.360]   As of the end of last year, fewer than 1.2% of borrowers continued making payments on
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.280]   their student loans, Mr. Kantrowitz said, but some of the borrowers took advantage of
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   the two plus years of optional, interest-free payments to wipe out their debt entirely.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.520]   This measure won't apply to balances that have already been paid off.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.480]   In other words, sucks to be you.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.000]   You missed out on your free money.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.760]   So that's the facts of what you need to know.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.320]   Now let's talk about planning.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.240]   Are there some planning opportunities?
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:31.560]   For here I want to go directly to Jeff Levine, CPA, PFS, and CFP, who is an extremely prolific
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.760]   Twitter @CPAPlanner on Twitter.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.680]   Wonderful Twitter account, works with Michael Kitsis as one of his financial planning nerds.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:44.600]   So let's go with Jeff's discussion on planning opportunities, one of the best financial planners
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.280]   to cover current events in detail.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.460]   So for many, the headline news from today is the potential forgiveness of a substantial
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.460]   amount of student debt.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.680]   In general, maximum debt forgiveness is limited to $10,000 per borrower, except for a Pell
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.560]   grant to $20,000.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.440]   A few important clarifiers.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.080]   It's not $10,000 plus $20,000 if you got a Pell grant.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.840]   It's $10,000 plus $10,000 more for a total of $20,000.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.920]   I've seen that misreported several times today.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:21.360]   Debt of Pell grant only boosts max loan forgiveness for undergrad.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.700]   Pell grants themselves don't generally have to be repaid.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.580]   So it's not that the extra money is for Pell grant repayment, it's extra forgiveness on
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:36.180]   loans because the person also got a Pell grant, which tend to go to lower income households.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.080]   Now let's talk about who qualifies for this relief.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.880]   Most taxpayers with federal loans will be eligible for the relief, but as income exceeds,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.000]   certain levels, the forgiveness is eliminated.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.760]   It sounds simple enough, but there's actually a lot here to consider.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.160]   Let's start with the thresholds.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.800]   Filing as joint or head of household, you have $250,000 limit.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.040]   Single or married filing singly, $125,000.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.160]   Now it's going to get interesting.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.160]   What's income?
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.600]   Unclear, but I'd suspect it's going to be AGI, Adjusted Gross Income, which is the type
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.320]   of income that income-driven repayment plans start with.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.280]   What year or years are the income limits in reference to?
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.760]   2020 or 2021?
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.200]   If in at least one of those years an individual's income was below their applicable threshold,
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.240]   they get the forgiveness.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.360]   Side note, the administration sort of has to do it that way.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   They're using the pandemic emergency as the justification for forgiving the debt legally.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.000]   Are those income thresholds a cliff?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.200]   I'm not totally sure, but it certainly appears so, which sort of creates some strange inequities.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:54.720]   In retrospect, you'd be way better off earning $124,000 in 2020 and 2021 and getting $10,000
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.240]   of forgiveness than if you had earned $125,000.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.760]   Now let's talk about planning.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.120]   Sadly, for most people, there is no real planning that can be done.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.000]   Whatever their income was in those years, it was.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   End of story.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.040]   But that's not to say there aren't at least some planning opportunities out there.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.440]   Two come to mind.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:21.600]   First, business owners who have not yet filed their 2021 tax returns may want to give serious
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.240]   thought to beefing up retirement contributions.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.600]   Even if it means giving more to employees than normal, getting AGI low enough to qualify
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.480]   for relief may more than make up for it.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:41.360]   Sorry, tweet thread messed up.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.120]   On the income side of things, all the forgiven debt will be tax-free at the federal level.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.880]   Things are dramatically more complex at the state level.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.580]   In some states, it's already tax-free.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.180]   State has no tax, conforms to federal rules, or has its own exception.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.320]   Some states, which don't currently have an exception, will create one, and instill others
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.920]   the discharged debt is going to be taxable.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.920]   Oof.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.680]   Kevin Cant has a good article on this, but I would anticipate more changes before year
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.680]   end.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   This is from thecollegeinvestor.com.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.200]   Okay, on to which loans qualify and which don't.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.560]   In general, federal student loans qualify for relief.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.640]   Private loans do not.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.080]   Some specifics.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.600]   Parent PLUS loans are eligible for forgiveness.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   Relevant income is that of the borrower, parent, and appears to have no impact on a child's
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.240]   eligibility to get forgiveness.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.760]   So in theory, a parent could have $10,000 of parent PLUS loans forgiven, and the childhood
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.680]   loans were taken for could have up to $20,000 of their own debt forgiven.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:46.480]   On the flip side, parents with $30,000 total parent PLUS loans, split evenly across three
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.400]   kids would appear to qualify for only $10,000 of forgiveness.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.800]   Graduate school loans are also eligible for forgiveness, up to $10,000.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.320]   One thing that's not clear is how FFEL program loans will be treated.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.460]   I strongly suspect that federally owned loans will be eligible for relief, but that privately
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.660]   held FFEL program loans will not.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:16.460]   This is, objectively, an incredibly unfair result for those whose FFEL program loans
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.680]   are still held by private companies.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.960]   Essentially, luck of the draw is determining who's getting a $10,000 break.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.000]   Oh, one more here on which loans count.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.620]   Student debt of active students is also eligible for relief, provided loans were funded by
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.720]   June 30, 2022.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.560]   True for everyone.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.480]   Important point, if the student was claimed as a dependent, you need to use the parent's
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480]   income.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   Finally, how do you actually get forgiveness?
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.160]   Well, for many it will essentially be automatic because the Department of Education already
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.600]   has income information on file.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.960]   For everyone else, a "simple" application will be made available by year-end.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.440]   Okay, moving on to other aspects of the announcement.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.280]   Prior to today, the current 0% interest rate and moratorium on federal student loan payments
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.780]   was set to expire at the end of the month.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.760]   But per today's announcement, we will have another.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.200]   I think this may be #5 just during the Biden era, with several before under Trump.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.120]   Extension, this time until December 31, 2022.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.360]   What's different this time is it appears to be the end of the line.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.300]   Both the White House's fact sheet and President Biden directly in his address made clear this
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.800]   is the final such extension.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.120]   Reminder only applies to federal debt.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.040]   I know.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.880]   Last item we'll dig into for tonight is the administration's plan for a new income-driven
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.380]   repayment plan.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:39.240]   There are already 5 of these things and now we're going to add a 6th.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.000]   Added complexity is the downside, the upside is the new IDR, income-driven repayment plan,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.040]   will offer material improvements for many borrowers, including new baseline for non-discretionary
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:56.640]   protected income of 225% of the federal poverty line income, currently 150% in most instances,
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.520]   maximum annual payments of 5% of discretionary income for undergraduate loans, and 10% for
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.600]   graduate loans, currently 10-20% depending on the program.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.000]   Note borrowers with both loan types will have a weighted average maximum loan payment calculated.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.240]   Good luck to whoever gets that job.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.400]   Balances won't increase as long as monthly payments, including $0 payments due to lower
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.720]   income, are made on time.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.700]   Remaining balances will generally be forgiven after 20 years of payments, but where the
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:29.480]   original balance was $12,000 or less, substitute 10 for 20 years.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.680]   One last point to make in light of today's announcements, please remember that there
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.120]   is currently a special opportunity with respect to the PSLF program.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.640]   In short, there's a limited amount of time during which individuals can apply for waivers
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.160]   to have prior payments that would not normally count towards forgiveness considered for that
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160]   purpose.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   This is huge.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.560]   The PSLF program isn't limited to $10,000 of debt.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   It can make all of an individual's qualified student debt disappear after 10 years of qualified
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.560]   payments.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.240]   For more info, it gives a link to studentaid.gov/announcements.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.000]   And so that is the current planning information.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.400]   So there's not much you can do, but if you can reduce your income through things like
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.360]   additional retirement contributions or something else to reduce your adjusted gross income
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.680]   for 2021 below the applicable limit, then possibly that will make you eligible for the
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.240]   student loan forgiveness.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.480]   So now let's pivot to some commentary on the topic, kind of more broadly from an economic
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:45.440]   perspective, from an ethical perspective, etc.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.140]   Because I think that's interesting.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.720]   There's not a lot that you can do to change this.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.240]   It's being done by executive order, by executive fiat.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   Time will tell.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.000]   So the first thing that will be interesting to see is if this actually goes through.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.920]   An announcement is one thing, but this is legally probably on pretty thin ice.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.600]   It's my understanding that the president is seeking to do this under the emergency
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.840]   powers granted by the pandemic.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.160]   And so that's why we have to do it now.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.360]   That's why everything's kind of wrapped up in yes, 2020, 2021 numbers, etc.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.560]   Maybe this will fly.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.800]   Maybe there's some legal issue.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:32.600]   I'm not a qualified commentator on that particular topic, but it's certainly on thin ice.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:38.880]   And I think that it very clearly, if it's not technically illegal, if it's not challenged,
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.520]   and again, I have no reason to know one way or the other, it certainly violates the basic
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:52.640]   structure of American politics and the structure, the basic idea of constitutionality.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:00.360]   The American president is not supposed to have powers to unilaterally choose to come
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.960]   into office and wave his magic wand and give money to a certain class of people and take
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.160]   money away from another certain class of people to do that.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.400]   So whether it's actually held up by a court debate of some kind, whether it happens or
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   not, we don't know.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.120]   And this is very clear and obvious, even from the politicians' mouths themselves.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:24.160]   You can go and you can find plenty of quotes of leading democratic politicians simply saying,
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.520]   "Yeah, the president doesn't have the authority to do this."
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.800]   Let me read to you directly from Speaker Pelosi's words.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   I'm reading from speaker.gov/newsroom/72821-2, which is a transcript of the Pelosi Weekly
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.600]   Press Conference for July 28, 2021.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:57.640]   And the question says, the question says, sorry, I went up to find the, here we go.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.560]   Question, there's been a lot of back and forth between the administration and Democrats here
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.160]   on Capitol Hill about student loans and canceling student loan debt.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.240]   Each have said, "Well, the president can do this by executive order."
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.040]   The president said, "Oh, let's do it by legislation."
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.000]   Could you explain why the administration and Democrats in Congress pushing for this or
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.360]   fighting this?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.400]   And I mean, it would seem there's not the votes to pass the bill.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.600]   Is that in fact the case?
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.000]   Is that why Congress is, Speaker Pelosi?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.040]   No, but thank you for your question.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.120]   It's so refreshing to get a question on substance and process, but not responding to whatever.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   Here's the thing.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   People think that the president of the United States, is this more on the subject than you
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.360]   ever want to know?
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.960]   Well, you'll let me know.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.600]   People think that the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.960]   He does not.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.600]   He can postpone, he can delay, but he does not have that power.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.680]   That has to be an act of Congress.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.240]   And I don't even like to call it forgiveness because that implies a transgression.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.200]   It's not to be forgiven, just freeing people from those obligations.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.240]   So the question of who gets forgiven, to use the term of art that is out there, is a debate.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.280]   Do we use whatever money there is for the broadest base of support of those with more
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.400]   people with even less debt or fewer people with more debt?
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.040]   That's a policy discussion.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.020]   But the difference between the president, the president can't do it.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.200]   So that's not even a discussion.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.040]   Not everybody realizes that.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:25.480]   But the president can only postpone, delay, but not forgive.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   Question.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.120]   And that said, following up, what would be the parameter?
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.420]   And what would be fair to those who have incurred major debts, repaid them, or are still working
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.420]   to do so?
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   Speaker Pelosi.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   And question.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.940]   And then if, say, something were to go through, say, okay, this group had to pay and this
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.520]   group does not.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.520]   Speaker Pelosi.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.560]   Yeah, well, you, there you are.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.880]   You've described it very well.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.760]   I do think that what the president is putting forth, and build back better in terms of opportunity
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.900]   for all Americans, whether they go to college or not, you know, they may not even aspire
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   to that.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.900]   And that's fine.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.900]   And that's fine.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.940]   But we do want to give them vocational training or other opportunities so they can reach their
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.520]   fulfillment as well.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.440]   So this is a broader discussion.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.360]   But it is, it's not one that we're going to solve right here and now.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.880]   But you, you, that would be an attitude that people would have.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.400]   But even take it on top of that.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.560]   Suppose your family was not, your child just decided they want to, at this time, not want
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.780]   to go to college.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.920]   But you're paying taxes to forgive somebody else's obligations.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.640]   You may not be happy about that.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   But you know what?
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.000]   We want all of our kids to reach their fulfillment.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.520]   To the extent that they want to go to college, we do not want them to be prohibited from
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   doing that for financial reasons.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.320]   I've had high school students come in here and say, with their grades, they're able to
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.320]   be accepted in the Ivy League here and there.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.840]   But their family's economic situation does not enable that to happen.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.800]   Because they have to stay close to home to work to be part of the family situation.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.640]   So what we'd like to do is have an economy that is fair, that gives opportunity and does
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.700]   not hold anybody back because of financial reasons.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.360]   And again, how some people may view the relieving people of this obligation has to be viewed
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.240]   in a fair way where we have something that gives opportunity.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.840]   That's the big word.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.960]   Opportunity to all of America's families.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   Yes, yes.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.480]   And we go on to more questions.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.600]   So that is a verbatim reading of the question answer from Speaker Pelosi of just over one
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.380]   year ago.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.640]   So legally speaking, the president is on very thin ice here.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.840]   But time will tell what will happen.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.760]   Of any branch of government, I have the most faith in the judicial branch, but I don't
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.940]   have much faith at all in it.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:37.440]   So time will tell whether some legal challenge comes, whether this happens or not.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.680]   I think what Speaker Pelosi pointed out though, there is at the core though of what is really
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.100]   angering a lot of Americans.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.000]   There are many people who are very happy.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   There are many people who have student debt who are very happy that their student debt
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.520]   will be reduced by again up to potentially $20,000.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.120]   And I hope, it's my earnest and sincere hope that for those people who have their debt
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:11.720]   reduced, that it will enhance their financial opportunity and that they will be able to
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.280]   stabilize their finances.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.680]   I hope that they'll be able to make wise decisions with their money.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.640]   I hope they'll use that money that they were granted with great fortune, and I hope that
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.560]   they'll take it and they'll invest it back into their communities, into their societies.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.960]   And I hope that they will be grateful for the forgiveness that was given to them.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:37.200]   I think for many of us, it's hard to think that $10,000 or $20,000 was going to change
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.400]   much about your overall situation.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.340]   It doesn't seem like that much money to most of the listeners of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.560]   But for many people it is.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:51.000]   It is a substantial amount of money and it may provide some very welcome relief for them.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:00.400]   And so I hope that this cancellation helps them and helps them to improve and solidify
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.640]   their overall situation.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:09.240]   We do want for a strong and stable society, we want to have maximum financial stability
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.760]   among our fellow citizens.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:20.700]   Now it is clearly a naked political move to do this at this particular time.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:27.140]   And so I think it's fair to simply accept that as being self-evident and not worry too
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.140]   much about it.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.580]   That's what politicians do.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.200]   In the modern age, we elect politicians to take money from other people and give it to
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.880]   the people that we think should have it.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.040]   That's basically what we do and we shuffle them all around.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.680]   And that has long-term effects on the basic nature of a society and of a government, but
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.920]   the politicians are simply doing what the politicians need to do.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.160]   Politicians are very worried about midterm elections and so this needed to happen now
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.900]   so that there would be some hint of justification due to the COVID policies.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:03.780]   But it also needed to happen now so that they can potentially get some political breath
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.380]   prior to midterm elections coming up fairly soon.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:14.020]   On the other hand, this will give the Republicans political fodder to talk about what the Democrats
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.020]   are doing.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:20.180]   I think very clearly it's causing a lot of people to feel upset if you've done things
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.380]   like pay off your loans.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:27.100]   I read you two personal text messages that I received from friends of mine within about
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.420]   20 minutes of each other.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.540]   And one friend says this, "Paid off all of my wife's law school student loans this summer
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.920]   because I'm a big fat chump lol.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.740]   Now that I'll be paying off everyone else's loans too, I'm just grateful that I have a
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.740]   lot of practice."
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.720]   It was one friend of mine.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:51.200]   And then another friend wrote to me completely unsolicited and said this, "My mom co-signed
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.180]   on my sister's useless gender studies degree and it put my mom in a really bad financial
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.180]   spot.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.580]   She ended up paying it off in a lump sum a few months ago to save on interest, dropping
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.520]   $40,000 or so, and planning on my sister paying her back.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.880]   If she waited a few more months, she would have saved $10,000 or $20,000.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.980]   I'm not sure if she has Pell grants or not.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.300]   My mom is not excited.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.700]   Obviously, multiple mistakes were made, but Biden is not helping."
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.060]   And so that's a reaction from two people.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.420]   I'm sure that there are many other people who have done that.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:26.060]   And this is one of the biggest problems with the biggest moral and ethical and even civilizational
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.400]   problems with government programs.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.740]   That people who do the right thing, people who behave responsibly, often feel like they
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.300]   get screwed.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.220]   And people who do the wrong thing, those who behave irresponsibly, who take out too much
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:47.460]   in student loan debt, or who don't make alternative decisions, it feels like they get all the
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.660]   good stuff.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:54.900]   And this is one of my biggest long-term concerns with basically the fabric of our civilization.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.740]   For example, so many things we go through.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.940]   Let me give one kind of wide-ranging example and we'll come back to politics.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:09.420]   I'm convinced myself that one of the things that sows more discord at the heart of our
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.580]   society is the welfare state.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:18.260]   The idea that the basic function of government is to take from some people and give to others,
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.220]   and that politicians get to decide who we take from and who we give to.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.780]   And this puts a deep level of distrust in society.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.060]   Let me use an example I mentioned in passing.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:32.900]   I recently was talking about immigration, and I mentioned that I myself would prefer
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:38.460]   that the government have no immigration laws hindering the flow of non-criminal persons
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.320]   into the country.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.500]   Let me define a couple of terms there for just a moment so you understand my opinion,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.360]   and you'll see why the welfare state is important.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.420]   The reason I believe this is twofold.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:55.960]   Number one, I have a hard time seeing why any government entity has the right to say
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.960]   who can and cannot live within its borders.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.900]   What gives somebody the moral right, what gives a government official the moral right
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.020]   to deny someone else the ability to travel on its borders?
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.300]   I don't see that as a moral right, it's just simply a right of force.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.860]   Whoever has the force can make whatever rules they want.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.080]   But more importantly, I think government bureaucrats are stupid.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.300]   And I can't possibly understand how anybody could think a government bureaucrat could
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:29.780]   figure out the appropriate number of people to live in one country, or to admit a certain
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.260]   number of workers for a certain occupation.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:39.340]   And so we need to issue 100,000 visas for people in this occupation, we need to do this
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.020]   thing.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.500]   Government bureaucrats are stupid.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.780]   Central planners are stupid.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.180]   They're stupid and they're incompetent, and they're stupid and incompetent whether they're
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:52.580]   in the USSR, or whether they're in the CCP, or whether they're in the USA.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:56.260]   Government bureaucrats are stupid and incompetent.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.620]   And every government bureaucracy is bloated, expensive, and an absolute waste and drain
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.860]   on productive people all over.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:09.060]   The US Immigration Department, from personal experience with many friends, is the stupidest
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.240]   perhaps of all immigration departments in the world.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.060]   The most dysfunctional, horrifically performing.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.460]   Some people have visas at sale right through.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:24.340]   I recently met some immigrants from France who had come into the United States, and they
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.140]   had applied for the lottery, they had to get out of France, they didn't feel like it was
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.940]   safe to live in France anymore.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.740]   They applied for the US Green Card lottery, they were granted, and basically a few months
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.000]   they were given access to the United States and everything worked.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.600]   When I compare that to the dozens of stories that I've personally known of people who've
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.620]   waited years and years and years and years and years and years, while in various forms
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.940]   of the process, I was absolutely shocked.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.100]   I want to give credit where credit is due, it worked for at least one person.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.260]   So I don't think that a government agent is smart enough, or in any way informed enough,
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.500]   to have an idea about how many people, how many workers should be able to come into a
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:07.460]   country or how many people should be allowed to come in under a certain kind of visa.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.540]   And I trust the wisdom of the crowds and supply and demand far more than I trust a government
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.820]   bureaucrat.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.100]   So does that...
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.140]   But what's the problem?
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:21.580]   Why is anti-immigrant sentiment so high in the United States and in many places around
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.580]   the world today?
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:27.420]   Well, I think at its core, one of the reasons the anti-immigrant sentiment is high is not
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.660]   because of any kind of overt racism.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:35.180]   It's not because of any kind of xenophobia.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.180]   I don't think...
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.700]   I think the United States of America is, at least in my experience, the least racist place
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.300]   in the world that I've ever had the privilege of traveling.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.660]   There may be other places, but in actuality, it's the least racist place that I have been
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.660]   to.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:53.500]   So Americans don't generally care about the color of the skin or where their neighbors
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.020]   came from.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:00.100]   It's not a matter of xenophobia, why the immigrant sentiment is... the anti-immigrant sentiment
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.100]   is high.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.100]   I think it's a matter of the welfare state.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.660]   And the idea is, true or not, the idea or the impression that people have is, "Well,
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:14.660]   those immigrants come here, they don't pay taxes, they go to the hospital, they get free
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.740]   hospital care, they get free education, they get free this, free that, free government
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.300]   money of all kinds, and they take advantage of the system."
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:28.340]   So when I ask people who are virulently anti-immigration if they would feel the same way if there were
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:33.740]   no welfare state, so far, my experience has been that unanimously no.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.180]   People recognize that other people are people and they can do it, but they feel they're
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.340]   taken advantage of.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:44.620]   They feel like immigrants are a burden on the system and that too much money goes to
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.620]   them.
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.460]   Now set aside whether that's actually true or not.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.980]   I'm skeptical, but set that aside.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.620]   The point is that I think you can have one or the other.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:58.620]   You can either have an open border or you can have a welfare state, but you can't have
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.020]   both.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.620]   Because if you have an open border and you have a welfare state, then you open yourself
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:08.660]   up to people taking advantage of those programs excessively of the worst kind and you drive
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.660]   out the best kind.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.060]   So you can have one or the other.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:17.300]   So as long as you can have a welfare state, you have to have strict restrictions on immigration.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.940]   So bring that to the modern day and bring it back to student loans.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.040]   I think this is one of the big issues that is fundamentally bubbling and causing massive
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.580]   division among the American population, among the American citizenry.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:37.260]   People are angry about the idea that something is being taken from them and given to someone
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.260]   else.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.100]   They're angry about it.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.980]   And this doesn't help.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.620]   This sows the seeds more and more.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:50.700]   And again, with those government programs, because governments are seeking to try to
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:56.740]   shore up the weakest among us, but because governments can't discriminate based upon
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:04.980]   merit and virtue, you wind up with crazy proposals like this particular proposal.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.980]   And responsibility is now a vice rather than a virtue.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:16.020]   There are many, many, many, many people who have been given wise counsel regarding college
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.580]   and college debt.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:21.700]   There are many people who have chosen to not go to college because they didn't feel like
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.560]   they were ready for college and they didn't see the point of spending money on a program
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.100]   that was on something that wasn't a good fit for them.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.780]   There are many people who chose to go to less expensive colleges because that was what they
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.060]   could afford.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:43.180]   There were many people, there have been many people who have chosen to go to colleges that
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.660]   to stretch out their college so they could work their way through, to take a manageable
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.620]   course load, etc. in order to avoid student debt.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:54.380]   And then there have been many, many graduates who have graduated from school with student
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.080]   debt and who have worked diligently to pay off their student loans.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.900]   And all of those people feel now like they were the chumps.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.940]   They feel like they were stupid.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.660]   And yet those were the people who behaved responsibly.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:15.060]   And the people who feel really smart right now are those who had student loans, who strung
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.740]   out their student loans, who didn't pay them back.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.740]   And by the way, that was in many cases, it was a very smart thing to do not to pay your
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.220]   student loans debt but debts back because of deferred payments, because of income-based
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.660]   repayment plans, because of low interest rates, etc. guaranteed by the federal government.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.820]   There are many people though who, the people who feel smart are fundamentally those who
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.340]   borrowed money.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:43.100]   Now you know of course, right, you know that a certain portion of the people really need
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.260]   that relief.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.740]   And you're glad for those people.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:52.300]   Even if you're gnashing your teeth about this policy, you're glad for those people.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:39:01.860]   But this kind of decision is basically the expression of the stupidest kind of government
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.820]   program that you could have.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:09.660]   It's also an expression of stupidity because it's the government, the federal government
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:20.220]   itself that seeded the miscalibrations in the college marketplace due to these federal
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.380]   loan programs in the first place.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:28.540]   So I started with the White House's press release and right in the front part of the
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:34.580]   government propaganda piece, the government says, and I quote, "Since 1980, the total
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.180]   cost of both four-year public and four-year private college has nearly tripled, even after
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.420]   accounting for inflation."
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.220]   Well, why might that be?
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.100]   Well, it has to do with the entire system of student loans and the way that the government
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:52.460]   guaranteed the money, student loans not being bankruptable, and then colleges going after
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.060]   the money intensively.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:01.320]   And so they seeded the crisis, they created the problem in and of themselves, and now
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.640]   they're offering the solution to the problem.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.660]   But what's the other solution with the problem?
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:13.260]   Well, an estimate by the Wharton School says that the total cost of this particular program
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.660]   will be somewhere between $305 billion and $980 billion.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:25.100]   Clearly a large range, but this right here, forgiving debt in a time of significant inflation,
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:33.300]   this right here will produce a dramatic economic boost that will drive inflation even more.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.540]   Will it be noticeable or not?
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.540]   I don't know.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.460]   Even if it's a trillion dollars, is that noticeable?
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.460]   Time will tell.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:44.140]   But having money forgiven frees up now that money for other things, and it's going to
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.740]   create its own problems.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:50.020]   I'm reminded of the classic story that we love so much to tell.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.860]   I think it's true.
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:56.300]   It may be just apocryphal at this point in time, but I believe it's true of when the
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:02.500]   Indian governmentâ€”it's the classic story of unintended consequences.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:07.820]   The story goes that there was a town in India, a city in India somewhere, that had too many
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.500]   cobras, the snakes, the biting snakes.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:18.180]   They decided that they would offer a reward to people who would go out and bring cobras
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:23.060]   in for killing cobras so they could reduce the cobra population.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:30.020]   They set a reward amount, making up numbers, $50 per cobra to bring people in, and people
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.020]   bring the cobras in.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.540]   Well, people brought cobras in, the government paid the money, paid the money, paid the money,
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.900]   but they realized that, "Wait a second.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.260]   There are a lot of cobras being brought in."
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.340]   And what they quickly came to understand was that people had seen an opportunity to make
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.820]   some free money by raising cobras, and so they were actually breeding cobras and creating
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.300]   more cobras so that they could go and get free money.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:55.100]   Well, of course, the government politicians reacted and said, "Well, this can't work,"
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.100]   and so they canceled the whole program.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.920]   So now you had people who were breeding cobras.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.180]   What do you think they did with all those cobras?
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.580]   Set them loose on the street, and now after the well-intentioned program, you wind up
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.740]   with a much higher cobra population.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.880]   So again, I think it's probably true, but I've never verified it.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:19.940]   So regardless of whether it's a true story or not, it drives the point.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:25.700]   You can easily understand how that would happen because you have now, because it flies.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.920]   The story illustrates what we know of as incentives, incentives to behavior.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.600]   So the government creates a program and says, "Everyone needs to go to college," and after
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.740]   World War II, figuring out how do we get people in college and improve the productivity of
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:45.520]   our workforce, we come out with the GI Bill, and then later we start to see the growth
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.040]   of people going to college.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.000]   So then you have the federal student loan program.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   You have lots and lots of new colleges created.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.680]   Why are the new colleges created?
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.400]   Because now money is easy to get.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.040]   Why is the money easy to get?
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.600]   Because the government says, "We'll guarantee the loans for you, and your students can't
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.140]   bankrupt their way out of it."
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:11.000]   So you create massive new numbers of college, massive levels of college enrollment.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.700]   Some of those colleges, very high-priced, and in many cases flat-out abusive in terms
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.180]   of their recruiting policies, et cetera.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:26.300]   You have virtually no obstacles to young people signing their life away, borrowing tons of
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   money.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.560]   It's as simple as a signature for most of us.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.180]   And so you have then the colleges increasing tuition commensurate with that.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:40.020]   And then you have this incredible civilizational push saying that everybody should go to college.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.140]   Clearly false, as I have detailed in other discussions.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.540]   Most people are not suited for the academic life of college.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:51.140]   And so then you have people go to college, many of them drop out.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.140]   People are very hurt.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.100]   They don't have a college degree, but now they have debt.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.180]   And then the whole situation goes in.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.580]   So then what does the government come along?
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.340]   "Well, we're going to come along and we're going to cancel student loans."
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:04.060]   It's just one dumb policy after another, and a dumb policy leading to another dumb policy.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:09.420]   And that's what happens when you have this kind of system, when people are relieved of
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.060]   consequences for their choices.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:18.700]   If lenders were not guaranteed by the federal government laws that student loans are not
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.380]   bankruptable, then bankruptcy would have wiped out so many of the student loans, the most
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.380]   egregious situations.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:27.420]   And because they're not bankruptable, that hasn't solved it.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:36.260]   And bankruptcy is a much better policy for getting rid of debt, of toxic debt, because
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:42.420]   bankruptcy trains the lender and the borrower to be more careful and more discerning.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.860]   And so it really actually hurts lenders.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.980]   And so at its core, this is a disaster.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.780]   Now hopefully it's not a huge disaster.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.260]   It's just one thing among many, but it's a disaster because it sows these seeds.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:01.260]   And I'll give you an example from my own life of how this affects people.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.300]   Anybody who's listened to more than a few of my podcasts knows that I'm not, very few
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.140]   people would classify me as an unopinionated guy.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.060]   I have my convictions, I have my opinions, and I do my best to be clear on them and then
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.780]   to try my best to live in accordance with them, imperfectly as we all do, but I try
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.780]   to be a fairly convictional guy.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:28.140]   When I was younger, I believed very strongly in the idea of personal responsibility, taking
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:34.020]   care of yourself, taking care of yourself and not being a burden on the system.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:39.300]   I believed very strongly in being a kind of person who was a producer and a contributor
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.100]   rather than a taker.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:47.500]   I believed strongly that it was morally right for me to take care of myself.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:56.740]   And so the practical expression of this was that in 2008, when I was laid off from a job
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:02.060]   in 2008, but I myself, even though I was laid off from a job and a layoff and I would have
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.700]   qualified for unemployment payments, I thought, "Well, I don't need the money.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.700]   I have money saved.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700]   I didn't have any debt.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.700]   I have money saved.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.300]   I don't need the money and I don't want to be the kind of guy who takes a government
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.300]   handout."
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.980]   I actually am genuinely worried about ever becoming the kind of guy who takes a government
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.180]   handout because I'm worried about what that would do to my character.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:25.940]   I don't know that I'm a strong enough person to resist the weakness of my character if
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.700]   I wound up becoming the kind of guy who would take a government handout.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.380]   So I said, "I'm not going to take it."
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.820]   And so I didn't file for unemployment.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:37.620]   I spent some time, spent my own money, later wound up getting another job.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.940]   Four years later, I was doing financial planning and I'm watching all of these people who were
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:53.860]   getting extended unemployment payments under the 2008, all of the response to the 2008-2009
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.100]   financial crisis.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:00.660]   And I vividly remember I was sitting at somebody's apartment in Juneau Beach, Juneau Beach, Florida,
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.180]   beautiful little beach town.
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:06.780]   And I was meeting with this lady who had moved down from New York and she had gotten laid
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.540]   off a long time earlier.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.660]   And I'm sitting there doing financial planning and she's going to the beach every day, literally
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:17.380]   going to the beach every day, and she's enjoying the extended unemployment.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:24.060]   And she had milked her unemployment payments until the very last end of the number.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.860]   I forget what it was, 52 weeks or something, all of the extensions.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.620]   She's like, "Yeah, my unemployment is going to run out in two months so I'm going to have
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:37.580]   to figure out what I'm going to do and probably start looking for a job sometime soon."
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.020]   And I thought to myself, "Joshua, you schmuck.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.020]   What's wrong with you?
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.580]   You chump.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.220]   Why didn't you take the money?
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.860]   What's wrong with you?
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.420]   You are a chump.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.780]   What did your little kind of moral crusade accomplish for anybody?
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.540]   All it did was screw you.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.100]   You would have been better off taking unemployment, milking it as long as possible, substituting
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.580]   with your own savings, do whatever is necessary to have the minimum action necessary to file
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.020]   the forms and move on.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.740]   And take the money and do something fun, right?
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.380]   Go travel and go do something interesting."
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.420]   And I felt like such a chump.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.260]   And I promised myself from then on, "I'm never going to do that again.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.140]   I'm just going to take the money."
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:26.100]   And so I've been self-employed and a business owner since then so I've never had the opportunity
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.300]   to get unemployment and file for it.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.260]   But I've done podcasts here on Radical Personal Finance about how to get laid off from your
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.780]   job so you get unemployment insurance, unemployment payments.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:40.620]   And then also, of course, there is the factor that I understood finally that it was just
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.220]   an insurance program and if you get it laid off, take it.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.660]   But the point is that it changed me.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.460]   And I really feel guilty about it because I still believe in the power of self-reliance.
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:58.140]   I still actually worry that if I ever got laid off and had a legitimate unemployment
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:04.980]   claim that if I started to get free government money or free insurer money, then it would
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:05.980]   harm my character.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.780]   So I worry about it.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.260]   But since that time when I realized I was a chump, I've told people, "Take all the money
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.260]   you can get, right?
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.260]   They're giving it out to everyone else.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.860]   Take all the money you can get."
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.820]   That is a cancer at the heart of society.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:27.660]   But it's a major â€“ hypocrisy is not the right word â€“ discontinuity in my opinions.
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.820]   But basically, I look at it and many people do.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.820]   You're like, "Burn it all down, right?
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.220]   If we're all going to do this, then let's just burn it all down.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:37.500]   Screw the concept of self-reliance and taking care of things.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.820]   Let's just all get our money and, hey, bring the end on faster and then we'll figure
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.420]   out what's next."
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.580]   And that's destructive.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.740]   And yet millions â€“ many people, I would guess â€“ lots of people â€“ I don't know
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.580]   the number â€“ lots of people are looking at this news and they're feeling the exact
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.820]   same thing.
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:58.500]   And that's â€“ I'm really â€“ I think that's really dangerous for the American psyche because
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:04.260]   the American citizenry is one that has been traditionally built upon these concepts of
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:09.500]   self-reliance, upon the concepts of independence, on the concepts of taking care of yourself
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.620]   and of other people.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.020]   Oftentimes Europeans look on and they wonder, "Why doesn't the United States have as
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.660]   developed a welfare state as we do?
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:19.660]   What's wrong with that, right?
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.460]   Here's the United States, the only country in â€“ the only advanced developed country
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.100]   in the world that doesn't have government healthcare, etc."
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.680]   Well, it's because this is a fundamental part of the fabric of the United States.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.300]   And so â€“ but that fabric is being destroyed.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.860]   That fabric is being dismantled.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.020]   And so I don't think it's a tipping point.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:43.580]   I don't think it's the thing any more than the bush bucks of sending out money or
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:48.540]   cash for clunkers or any of these other boneheaded programs that they come up with.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.300]   They're not the thing that leads, but it's all just â€“ it's death by a thousand cuts.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:58.540]   It's kind of a continual thing.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.420]   And it fundamentally alters people.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.620]   When you recognize that the government's going to send you stimulus money during a
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:10.780]   pandemic and you recognize that you can get â€“ file for free programs or free money,
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.940]   you feel like a chump if you don't take advantage of it.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.660]   And so that changes the culture.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:21.740]   And it changes the culture over generations and it has a long-term impact.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.740]   What do you do about it?
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.180]   There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:29.860]   If you want to be free out of it, you could do what I've done, which is one of the reasons
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:35.700]   why I pursued what I did with the whole internationalization stuff.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.700]   I think it's important to guard your own character.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:45.100]   I think it's important to recognize that relying on this stuff is really dangerous.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.540]   It makes you a slave.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.220]   Relying on government money makes you a slave.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:54.900]   I looked at â€“ when the PPP program came out during the pandemic, I looked at it and
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.300]   I was like, "You know what?
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.700]   I should get some of this money."
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.700]   Again, I have this long, festering wound from 2008, 15 years now.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.460]   I'm like, "I just â€“ I never get any free government money.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:05.900]   How can I get some free government money?"
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.900]   And like, "Here's a program that seems tailor-made for me."
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:13.220]   But I looked at it and I said, "I'm not getting in bed with the government."
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.740]   So it has to almost be a convictional thing.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.260]   Like, "I don't want those people in my life."
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.420]   I'll try to control my speech a little more.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.140]   "I don't want those people in my life."
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.300]   And it's the same thing with all the government money, right?
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:28.620]   The government money, all of the Title IX money is made that â€“ it's destroyed the
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:29.620]   university scene.
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:34.260]   It's made that all the colleges are beholden to the government because they take government
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.260]   money.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.700]   So I think that you can strengthen yourself and say, "I'm not taking your money.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.940]   I'm taking â€“ I'm not going to take your money.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.340]   Therefore, I'm not going to be accountable to you.
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:45.820]   I'm not going to have to follow your rules.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.880]   I'm going to do what I think is right."
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.100]   So time will tell.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.100]   Time will tell.
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.420]   It's not something that is unifying.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:59.260]   I guess the last point I would make is let's talk about a couple of practical effects.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:06.300]   One of the things that bothers me so much about this is it's extremely classist.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:12.540]   Who benefits from this particular government action?
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.540]   Who benefits?
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.220]   Well, people who have student loan debt.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.740]   Who are the people who have student loan debt?
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.860]   They are people who have gone out and gotten accepted to a college and started to go to
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:29.780]   that college and didn't pay for it fully out of their own pocket.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.060]   Whether they graduated or not, they're people who did that.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:38.980]   So what that means is you have a certain class of person that has student loans.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:44.540]   It's either someone who is accepted to college or somebody who has a college education.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.420]   That is the class of person.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.100]   Now who is paying for the money?
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:55.460]   It's a government program, so it's coming out of taxpayer dollars, the general fund.
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:54:02.620]   Of course, those taxpayer dollars are fundamentally provided primarily by the top 5 to 10% of
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:07.860]   wealthy earners, income earners in the United States who pay most of the taxes.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.800]   So you could argue that it's a classist thing where you're taking money from the richest
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.140]   people and you're giving it to basically the middle class college educated people.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:23.100]   The problem is the average citizen in the United States doesn't see himself as a taker.
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.580]   The average citizen in the United States sees himself as contributing.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.500]   Even if it's a mere, you know, two cents, he still sees himself, "I pay my taxes.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.420]   I file my tax returns."
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:37.500]   Remember that most people don't conceive of how much money they pay in taxes.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.240]   They don't know where to find it even on the tax form.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:48.360]   And so this means that the lower class people, not college educated, not going to college,
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:52.620]   are now feeling like money is being taken from us and our taxes.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.620]   We're good people.
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:58.980]   We pay our taxes and being used to pay for the middle class college elite.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:06.020]   And there's also a very strong correlation that Democratic voters tend to be college
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:22.820]   educated people predominantly, while Republican voters vary more, but more non-college educated
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:27.720]   people with student loans to be progressive Democrats, to be liberals.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.060]   And so you wind up with this class competition.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:35.660]   And at its core, I think this is one of the most destructive long-term trends.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:42.460]   Why do we have people bemoan and wail and moan and are upset about the division that
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.140]   we have in the American population?
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.340]   What causes it?
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:47.340]   Things like this, right?
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.780]   This constant class distinction.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:56.980]   Class distinctions on any basis, but it's a continual thing.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.500]   And it just kind of goes on.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.980]   The cancer goes deeper, the cancer goes deeper, the cancer goes deeper.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:09.020]   And more and more people see themselves as divided people across the board.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:13.620]   One of the things that bothers me the most, the Ten Commandments, God said, "Thou shalt
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.900]   not covet."
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.340]   "Thou shalt not covet."
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.340]   What is coveting?
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:23.400]   Coveting means wanting desperately something that someone else has.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.100]   And there's an implication that you want it to the point where you just go out and take
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.900]   it unjustly.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.460]   That's the basic concept of covetousness.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.460]   What is unjustly?
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.860]   Well, it means you didn't earn it for yourself.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:39.600]   You want your neighbor's wife, so you go and you take your neighbor's wife.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.780]   You want your neighbor's money, so you go and you take your neighbor's money.
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:52.660]   Well, modern politics, basically redistributional politics, has rewarded broad-scale covetousness.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.300]   And those who engage in it the most feel very good about it, right?
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.020]   They feel good because we're going to take from those people and we're giving to give
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.580]   to these people over here.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:07.140]   But covetousness, just like any sin, covetousness is a cancer, where the longer it goes, the
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.140]   worse it gets.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.980]   The worse it gets, the more it destroys the host.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.980]   And so you see that in society.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:20.100]   Go and read a book like Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America, and you'll see an extraordinarily
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.100]   different country than what we have today.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:27.900]   And you say, "What was different about 1850 versus 2022?
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.700]   What was different?
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.700]   Why?"
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:36.180]   And again, we need to be cautious against a golden era fallacy.
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.540]   Things were not necessarily always better.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.100]   Politics have always been vicious, etc.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:47.260]   But I think at its core, one of the things that is a cancer in our society is this concept
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:52.060]   of covetousness, this concept of continually, "I'm going to take from them, give to those
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.060]   people.
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:57.360]   And I want political power so I can decide who gets taken from and who gets given to."
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.420]   And it's just a battle that goes on and on and on and on.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.420]   So that was more negative than I intended.
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.740]   At its core, I don't think this is something that needs to be.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.020]   It's just one more factor.
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.020]   It's the same thing.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:13.560]   Let me close with just a more neutral observation.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.700]   How does this end?
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.700]   Where do we wind up?
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:22.900]   I'm convinced, before I go there, I should make two more points because they're important
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.780]   and worth thinking about.
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:30.660]   Why is student loan debt the debt that should be forgiven versus any other debt?
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:34.600]   This has bothered me for years.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:41.380]   If you really want to relieve people's debt, why not pay off their cars?
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:45.380]   If you really want to relieve poor people's obligations, why not pay off their credit
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.220]   cards?
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:50.300]   Why is student loan debt the debt that's being canceled?
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.540]   Now, there are a couple of obvious answers.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.900]   Number one, the federal government is involved in student loan lending.
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:02.300]   So in terms of administering the cancellation of a debt, then obviously it's easier for
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:07.580]   the Department of Education to administer the cancellation of the repayment of federally
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:13.860]   guaranteed student loans than it is to pay off credit cards.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.900]   But that's not truly the ultimate obstacle.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:19.940]   Obviously, as we've seen with the stimulus money, they can just put money right in your
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.340]   bank account.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.780]   So why?
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:29.660]   Why not just put money right in the bank account and say, "We're going to give everybody $10,000"?
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:35.420]   The other obvious answer is, "Well, we need smart people to go to college."
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:37.500]   I think this is clearly what most people would say.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.660]   It's like, "Well, we want to reward people who've gone to college and have developed
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.980]   their education and who've enhanced themselves.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.420]   We want an educated workforce."
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:56.220]   And again, I don't think that that fits the basic idea of not creating classism, because
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.900]   the kinds of people who can go to college and the kinds of people who can get a college
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.500]   degree are the smartest people.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.580]   And in theory, that college degree should be paying off.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.860]   There's one of the memes that's going around the internet right now that says, "If your
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.100]   college degree isn't good enough for you to pay it off, then why should I have to pay
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.100]   it off?
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:15.740]   Why is it good enough for me to pay it off?"
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:22.220]   So it seems strange to me that we would engage in paying off student loans because people
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.460]   who have gone to college are, by definition of our day, the most privileged people.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.460]   Why?
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.940]   Why not pay off other forms of debt?
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.220]   Why not just send outâ€”if we're going to do a stimulus, why not just send $10,000 to
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.180]   everybody and tell everyone to pay down their debt?
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180]   Wouldn't that be better?
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:42.540]   And I think you see that these programs, like, I don'tâ€”to me it seems obvious.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:53.460]   Eitherâ€”why notâ€”orâ€”I'm stammering because I'm not trying to go too deeply into negative
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:58.060]   politics, but it's justâ€”it's such a naked political gambit.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.860]   It doesn't have a deep sense.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:07.580]   If you want toâ€”if you want to relieve the poorest among us, then relieve them directly.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:13.540]   This is why perhaps one of the best programs has been the earned income credit on the taxes.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:18.980]   It's a direct way of giving people who are working, doing things virtuous, working, but
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:21.380]   who aren't earning very much, direct money.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.460]   The earned income tax credit has been a wonderful tax credit.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:29.700]   So if you're going to practice redistributionist politics, why not practice it in a way that's
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.980]   not related to student loans and student debt?
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:39.180]   Why are we sending money to the smartest people who were able to successfully get into college
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.140]   and the people who society calls the most privileged?
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.540]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.680]   My final point is this.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:52.300]   If you take the logic of why we want to send money to people who have a student loan instead
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.820]   of other classes of people, if you take it to its extension, I think you're going to
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:02.140]   see why ultimately government colleges are going to be tuition-free for everybody.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:07.140]   And I have no idea, I'm just making up a number, but I would say 10 years, 15 years maybe,
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.140]   who knows?
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.120]   And again, I'm totally making it up, I have no logical argument to support that number.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:17.320]   But here's why, and I read it to you in the White House's press release.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:27.880]   One of the other initiatives that the Biden press release writer said here, and I quote,
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.080]   "We want to protect future students and taxpayers by reducing the cost of college and holding
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.860]   schools accountable when they hike up prices," and skipping down, "to further reduce the
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:41.240]   cost of college, the president will continue to fight to double the maximum Pell Grant
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.800]   and make community college free."
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.200]   So that's the current arena, the current frontier of this battle, is to make community
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.960]   college free.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.480]   So should community college be free or not?
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:02.440]   Well, I think, myself, my opinion is, yeah, either community college should be free or
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.900]   we should end the government school system.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.600]   And since there's only a tiny fringe minority of people who think that ending the government
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:18.240]   school system is actually a good idea, then the most likely answer is make community college
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.400]   free and make four-year colleges free and make every other college free all the way
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400]   through.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.280]   And to me, this seems like where we're most likely to end up practically in the United
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.280]   States.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:36.260]   Number one, there's ample historic precedent for this.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:45.440]   There's ample precedent all across Europe, higher education institutions are tuition-free,
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.440]   widely available.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:52.960]   And in fact, in many European countries, those universities are tuition-free to anybody who
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:59.160]   can apply, have the appropriate academic credentials to be admitted, and can come from anywhere
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.900]   in the world.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:06.640]   For years, I've followed the most famous as Germany, that Germany will allow any international
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.800]   student who can come, have appropriate academic qualifications, test scores, et cetera, to
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.120]   come and attend their universities tuition-free.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:20.080]   There are several Scandinavian countries, I mean, many European countries offer this.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.440]   The question is whether the instruction is done in English or whether it's in a local
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440]   language.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:30.080]   So often, the language barrier can often be substantial for people who are not from that
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.040]   region to go to a school, unless they offer more English instruction.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.920]   But this is the trend.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.640]   And I think this is probably where we wind up in the United States as well.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:48.400]   I don't see any moral difference or any real, any like philosophical difference between
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.760]   having government school paid for from K through 12 versus government school paid for from
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.280]   13 to 16, or from 13 to 18.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.480]   What's the difference at its core?
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.160]   There's, as I see it, there's no real difference.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:08.680]   So eventually, it seems to me likely that we'll wind up with tuition-free government
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:15.560]   universities, and then we'll wind up with a, the continuation of private universities
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.240]   competing in the private market for students where there were tuition paid programs.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.240]   And is that a bad thing?
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   I don't think so.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.880]   I mean, you know, my libertarian utopia doesn't exist.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.940]   It's never going to exist in my lifetime.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:32.360]   So having tuition-free universities, fine, you know, fine.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.920]   It's just, it's better than, better than incentivizing people for taking out debt than
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.960]   paying it off, probably.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.560]   And again, if we're going to have government K through 12, then why not government 13 to
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.560]   16?
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:50.600]   I think the good thing about that kind of university system is that it can eliminate
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:55.600]   some of the people going to college who shouldn't go to college.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:01.240]   Because entry into those universities, into government, into free government, tuition-free
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:09.960]   government universities is screened based on academic qualification, although I have
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.400]   not reviewed the numbers on this.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.680]   So I'm making an opinion that's unsupported by data here.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.240]   I'm expressing an observation or an opinion that's unsupported by data.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.440]   I think that means that there's more of a likelihood of the people being in those university
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.980]   classes who should be there.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:33.680]   One of the biggest problems of the American college system has been the, because of all
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:40.480]   the free money, there have been schools that have dramatically lowered entrance requirements
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.640]   and basically let anybody in.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.560]   And those are the people who've been the most hurt by it.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.200]   They're encouraged to go to college.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.760]   They can't get into a good college, and so they wind up going to a next door college
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.120]   that has high tuition.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.680]   They borrow money for it.
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.340]   They get two years into college.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.400]   They can't hack it.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.160]   They can't cut it for the reasons I talked about in an episode a couple months ago of
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.160]   who should go to college.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.160]   They can't cut it.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.160]   They're not smart enough.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.160]   They don't read well enough.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.760]   It just doesn't click with them.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.920]   They're not good at sitting in classes and producing what the teachers want.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.720]   They discover it's not for them.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.280]   They leave without a college degree but heavily saddled in debt.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.100]   Those are the people who have been very deeply hurt by the current system in the United States.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:25.440]   So if you change that system and you eliminate the tuition requirements, at least for government
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:32.060]   universities, and you screen people based upon academic qualifications, then the people
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:37.240]   who get in are likely to be suited for the academic life.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.480]   They're likely to be more successful in it.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.680]   And then if they're not and they drop out two years later, at least they're not harmed
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.080]   so substantially by it.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:51.220]   They had to pass the rigorous academic entry exams and then they're not harmed by it.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.660]   So I hope that that just caused you to think.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.140]   Again, who knows where we wind up?
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.140]   I don't know.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:05.740]   But again, I see this as a dramatic philosophical discontinuity.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:13.820]   And I think that human beings, being their core logical beings, who are able to understand
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:23.860]   and see logic, I think that if there's a discontinuity, eventually people will go to their actual
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:24.860]   beliefs.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.100]   They'll wind up there.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:32.340]   And so to me it just hasn't made sense for years why there should be a fundamental distinction
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:37.940]   between government schools for K-12 and government schools for 13-16.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:43.220]   There's ample precedent from countries all around the world, where even very high levels
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.220]   of education...
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:53.340]   I worked with a doctor from Mexico one time who was providing some eye care for me.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:09:00.100]   And this doctor, she said, she told me she had $50 a semester cost to go to medical school
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.340]   in Mexico.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:09.020]   And so there's precedent all around the world for even the highest levels of universities
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.140]   to be tuition free.
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.060]   But that doesn't exist in the United States.
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:17.740]   And since I don't expect there to be any kind of dramatic move, at least not now, not for
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.860]   a long time, I don't expect there to be a dramatic move of people saying, "Let's get
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.980]   rid of government schools," then I think it's more likely we go in this direction.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.820]   So time will tell.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.720]   In the meantime, what do you do?
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:37.540]   At its core, even though you feel like a chump, I think try to take... if you paid your loans,
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.420]   try to appreciate the fact that you proved to yourself that you were the kind of person
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.620]   who could borrow money and repay it successfully.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.020]   That shows the kind of person you are, and appreciate that.
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:55.180]   If you are having some of your debts relieved and having some of your student loans reduced,
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.180]   good for you.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:04.800]   Take the money and go and use it to increase your family stability, invest it in your community,
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.260]   do something with it.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.260]   That's wonderful.
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.380]   I'm grateful for your good fortune.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:15.740]   But in the future, both of those people, both of you, whichever one of those you are, you
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:20.620]   need to still continue to plan, because things are going to change rapidly in the coming
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.220]   decades.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:31.100]   And at its core, the character qualities and virtues of being self-reliant, caring for
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:36.920]   yourself, planning ahead, of being prudent, those are the things that truly will ultimately
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.180]   pay off.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.140]   And you want to develop those character qualities.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:46.380]   Otherwise, you're at the mercy of a broken political system.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:52.180]   So that's what you need to know about the current wave of legislation, the current news.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:55.420]   Hope that's helpful for you, and I'll be back with you very soon.
