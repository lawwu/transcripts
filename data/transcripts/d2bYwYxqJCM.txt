[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   The following is a conversation with Jason Kalacanis,
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.880]   who's an entrepreneur, investor, author of "Angel,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.920]   How to Invest in Technology Startups,"
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.400]   and as many people may know, he's a fun, brilliant,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.480]   longtime podcast host of "This Week in Startups,"
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.920]   and co-host of the "All In" podcast
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.640]   with Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sachs, and David Friedberg,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.000]   who all happen to be poker buddies
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.320]   and self-proclaimed besties.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.880]   The result is always a great listen
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.080]   due to both the love and the heated disagreements.

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.960]   As a side note, let me say that I've been learning a lot
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.560]   about real-world finance in the past few months.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.120]   To give you a bit of context,
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.000]   on the side, I've studied trading
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360]   from an algorithmic trading perspective
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.960]   as a machine learning and a game theory problem
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.280]   off and on for a few years in undergrad and grad school.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.040]   I found the distributed, complex system aspect of finance
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.480]   and economics in general fascinating.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.040]   But now, I find even more fascinating
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   the human side of the whole thing,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   ideas of greed, power, freedom, and truth.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.520]   Wall Street bets, Robinhood,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.080]   and the whole beautiful mess around this topic
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.800]   allows us to have great conversations about human nature
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.720]   and the systems that underlie the rise
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.800]   and fall of civilizations.

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.560]   I have a million things to talk to you about,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.120]   but we do happen to be living through
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.480]   what I would think of as a historic event
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.080]   in terms of its impact,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.560]   in terms of almost philosophically
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.280]   thinking about the role of people
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.560]   and how they can fight power
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.520]   with this whole Wall Street bets and GameStop situation.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160]   I was wondering, you've covered
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.120]   in your amazing All In podcast,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.500]   you guys have been having fascinating battles
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.480]   over this whole situation.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.960]   I was wondering if you could tell maybe
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.800]   from your perspective, as it's unrolling,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.280]   the saga of Wall Street bets and GameStop,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.000]   what are some interesting insights
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.800]   that you have about this whole set of events?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.680]   - In full disclosure,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.000]   I was an angel investor in Robinhood before they launched.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.760]   And when I met the founder, Vlad, and his partner,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.920]   you know, they pitched me at a bar
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   not too far from where we are right now in Palo Alto
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.040]   called Antonio's Nuthouse.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.560]   And my friend, Adeo, it's a really good story.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.760]   My friend, Adeo, had asked me
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.040]   to speak at his founder's institute,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.920]   which is kind of like an accelerator
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.440]   for people who are thinking about starting a company.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.880]   And so I gave a talk and then he said,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.320]   "Hey, let's go to Antonio's Nuthouse
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.400]   "and we'll meet Elon for a drink."
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.640]   And so Elon met us for a drink there.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.020]   And it's the divest of dive bars.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.200]   Like you'll take a beer-
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.560]   - I love the image of all of this.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.680]   You hanging out with Elon at a crappy bar.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   - Yeah, I mean, it is the worst bar in the peninsula.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.800]   Like just garbage on the floor
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.320]   and like cheap beer and warm beer.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.760]   And like you'll pick up your pint glass
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.800]   and be lipstick on it.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   It's just brutal.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.640]   - Classy.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   - Not your lipstick, you understand.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   Somebody else's lipstick.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   And so we're sitting there
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   and Vlad walks up with his partner
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.320]   and he says, "You're Jason Calacanis."
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.760]   And I said, "Tell me about your startup."
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.040]   He said, "How do you know I have a startup?"
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.340]   I said, "You recognize me."
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.720]   And I mean, that's the only way.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.840]   And he goes, "Is that Elon Musk?"
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.240]   I said, "Yes, Elon, come say hi."
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.520]   And he came over and said, "Hi."
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.360]   I said, "Tell me what you do."
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.000]   He said, "Well, I'm a quant."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.920]   I said, "What's that?"
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.960]   And he said, "Quantitative analysis."
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.120]   And I was like, "Oh yeah, yeah, I know about that.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.960]   "That's like you guys make algorithms
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.200]   "and then try to beat the market, right?"
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.040]   He's like, "Yeah."
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.260]   I was like, "So you're gonna pitch me on a startup
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.400]   "and you're gonna sell your algorithm to other people.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.380]   "And if it was so good,
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.880]   "why wouldn't you just use it yourself and print money?"
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.320]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah, no, no, that's not our business.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.180]   "Our business is we're gonna create an app
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.640]   "to get millennials to trade stocks."
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.060]   And he said, "Hmm, you do realize
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.740]   "there's no retail investors anymore.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.360]   "Like the dot-com crash plus the 2008 financial crisis
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.560]   "eliminated any individual's belief
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.680]   "in participating in the stock market."
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.920]   And he said, "That's the opportunity."
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   I said, "Okay, I like it.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.040]   "Tell me more."
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   He said, "Well, we're gonna get these millennials to trade."
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.540]   I said, "The same ones who live in their mom's basements
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.260]   "and take Uber and Lyft and are on their parents
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.300]   "have no money, got screwed and went 250K into debt
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.580]   "for school and now can't get a job, those people?"
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.420]   And he's like, "Yeah."
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.340]   I'm like, "Okay, they have no interest in their future,
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.760]   "but they're gonna trade stocks."
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.720]   He said, "Yeah, that's the opportunity."
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.800]   I was like, "How are you gonna make money?"
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.000]   And he said, "Well, that's the best part.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.060]   "It's gonna be free."
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.920]   And I said, "So your idea is to get a group of people
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.340]   "who have no interest in saving for their future
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.040]   "to trade and your business model is free."
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.880]   And he said, "Yes."
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.320]   I said, "I'm in."
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.260]   Because in almost all cases,
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.760]   the crazy outlandish ideas that nobody believes in
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.600]   are the ones that have the greatest returns.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.720]   I mean, Uber, I introduced to about 25 investors
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.280]   and three of us said yes.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.540]   So a full 12% of the community who saw that deal
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.640]   decided to do it.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.800]   - So your sense about this idea being good
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.880]   had to do with the fact that this guy was just crazy
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.480]   and ambitious and bold thinking,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.920]   or was it that there's something here
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.040]   in allowing a much larger magnitude of people
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.420]   to be able to be investors?
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.580]   - Yeah, the way to do really well as an angel investor
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.260]   or just in technology or in life
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.060]   is to not say what could go wrong,
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.420]   but to say what could go right.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.600]   And then to just imagine for a moment,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.100]   if it does work, what would the world look like?
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.660]   And so when Elon was investing in Tesla
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.780]   and some other guys were running it
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.680]   and he was trying to save the company,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.120]   is this gonna work?
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.820]   It was almost positively not gonna work.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.720]   And he knew that.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.300]   But if it does work, what does the world look like?
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.200]   And so that's really what you're looking for
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.820]   is not the chances of success,
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.100]   but if it does succeed, what would that look like?
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.820]   And that's what the world needs more people doing.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.340]   And so when you looked at Robinhood, it was like,
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.620]   well, if he does succeed, what would the world look like?
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.480]   And now we've seen what it looks like.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.220]   You have a generation who are so financially sophisticated
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.460]   that they know how to do puts and calls and shorts
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.560]   and research at a level
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.540]   that dominated the hedge fund industry.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.480]   So let's pause for a second.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.940]   These traders sitting there on a subreddit
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.820]   in a Discord server are able to do analysis and research
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.820]   and then act in unison to say,
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.380]   we're going to beat in the Robinhood sense,
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.240]   this group of sophisticated insiders
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.060]   who have more access and more access to capital,
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.140]   but we will figure out how to solve this problem.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.900]   And most things don't work.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.260]   It's like the Wikipedia.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.860]   There's no way the Wikipedia would ever work,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.820]   except it did.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.480]   You're like, how is this ever gonna work?
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.940]   You're not paying anybody,
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.660]   but it's built the largest corpus of an encyclopedia ever.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.900]   So I think Robinhood actually succeeded.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.140]   And then what we saw was this system,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.220]   and a lot of the systems in our society,
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.260]   whether it's the political system,
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.940]   the Constitution of the United States,
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   education, higher education, which you're involved in,
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.620]   and then even the financial system,
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.500]   we have not stress tested it,
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.340]   and we don't actually know all the edge cases
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.260]   and how it works.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.820]   So Trump was able to just really put this crazy stress test.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.140]   Is the democracy going to hold?
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.120]   Are we gonna break this 200-some-odd-year-old experiment?
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.720]   And then we looked at the financial markets,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.800]   and it turns out there were more people shorting the stock
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.120]   than shares were available.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.560]   I don't know how that's possible.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.160]   And then I'm trying to uncover,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.040]   where can I see a list of people who have shorted the stock?
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.600]   And it's like, you can't,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.280]   but we can tell you sort of how many every two weeks
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   or maybe twice a week.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.640]   We can create a report.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.040]   Maybe we know.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.760]   - I was surprised that nobody knows
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.160]   the list of people who were shorted,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.720]   and you guys were trying to figure that out.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.960]   - Yeah, there's no transparency on a lot of these systems.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.440]   And if you call to try to short a stock,
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.800]   it's almost like they'll tell you on the phone,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.640]   like, "Let me see.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.000]   "I think I might know a guy who has shares to loan out."
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.960]   So it's like, am I calling to try to find
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.760]   a '73 Mustang Grande in gold,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.880]   and you're gonna call around?
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.640]   It's like, shouldn't this be on a ledger somewhere
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.140]   and be completely transparent?
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.880]   So now we're seeing those things,
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   and I think the investigations will make it super clear.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.000]   But of course, in a vacuum, without information,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.760]   there are so many investors in these startups
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.560]   that conflicts can start to appear,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.840]   and then you know how it is with people,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   and conspiracy there is, the mind starts to wander.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.620]   And so in some cases, there is actually a conspiracy,
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.680]   and then in other cases, people's mind will fill in,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.320]   like, "Oh my God, there's some grand conspiracy here."
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.040]   I can tell you, Robinhood's only goal
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.000]   is to get more people to trade stocks
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.880]   and to democratize it even more.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.640]   And they apparently were on the brink of seizing
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.720]   as an entity if they didn't get more money
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.040]   to cover all these trades.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.080]   I mean, they were on the brink,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.640]   and they raised three and a half billion dollars
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.040]   or something like that in a week.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.240]   - Yeah, so in some sense, Robinhood enabled this very,
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.320]   like, the magic of this distributed system
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.000]   of Wall Street bets, right?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.280]   You said Wikipedia, which is another,
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.360]   which is probably one of my favorite websites
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.320]   and one of my favorite examples
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.440]   of a distributed system somehow coming together in a way,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.360]   just like you said at that crappy bar,
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.440]   I would have guessed it would never work.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.760]   But if it does work, it changes everything, and it did.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.440]   And Robinhood in that same way probably enabled
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.240]   or was one of the major enablers of Wall Street bets,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.160]   of giving power, like, empowering young kids
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.840]   to learn about how this whole messy financial system works
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.680]   and take on the big elite centralized players.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.000]   - Yes, and you know, it's very easy.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.480]   When these companies get big,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.240]   one thing that's changed is the footprint of these startups
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.080]   and the velocity at which they grow.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.160]   So something like Airbnb is another perfect example
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.080]   of something that should really not work in practice,
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.960]   but it does.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.040]   Like, I'm gonna rent my couch or my extra room to somebody
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.120]   like a serial killer,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.200]   or I'm gonna stay in somebody's house
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.320]   like a serial killer's house.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.720]   And, you know, it's like, it really sounds scary,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.960]   but it actually works.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   And it has not destroyed the hotel business.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.680]   It has added.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.960]   So the best startups induce a market to exist.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.360]   If you look at, you know, Uber or Airbnb,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.640]   people replace their cars,
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.400]   and Uber was not competing ultimately with taxis.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   They were competing with car ownership,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.640]   public transportation, walking, or just not going out.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.680]   And then you look at Airbnb,
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.240]   a lot of people who stay in an Airbnb
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.440]   would not be taking a trip to Kyoto,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   if not for the fact that they could get a $75
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.600]   beautiful room with great reviews in Kyoto for three weeks.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.960]   It inspires people and it manifests a market
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.520]   because the product is so transcendent, right?
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.400]   And I think that's one of the things that Robinhood did.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.040]   You can't learn how to do this options trading
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.680]   and puts and calls and all this sophistication stuff,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.040]   unless you actually do it.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.400]   It's just too hard to learn, except in practice,
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   just like poker.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.600]   If you wanna learn how to play poker or guitar
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.960]   or tennis or skiing, like you could talk about it,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.320]   you can watch YouTube videos,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.120]   but at a certain point you gotta get on the mountain.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.280]   At a certain point, you gotta put some chips in the pot.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.960]   And it's gonna be painful.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.120]   Like poker's gonna be painful.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.240]   You're gonna lose a lot of money.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.840]   That's why you should play at the small tables first.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.240]   And even in trading, like you look at people
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.880]   who are doing this crazy trading in GameStop,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.840]   a company that's worth maybe a couple of billion dollars,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.000]   but certainly not tens of billions of dollars.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.080]   Of course, the people who are throwing their money in last
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.240]   are gonna lose it.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.480]   I think everybody knew that.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.760]   And so it was a momentum play
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.520]   and they're betting against the hedge funds.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.160]   So I think it's good for people to learn
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.440]   and become financially literate
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.640]   and just always understand the concept of the risk of ruin.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.040]   The good news is for a young person,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.760]   the risk of ruin might be like they lose $5,000 or something
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.680]   and then they have to build their stack back up.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.240]   But that's really the only thing I am concerned about
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.320]   is there are people who will play poker or blackjack
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.080]   or sports betting or whatever it is and lose control.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.320]   Just like there might be people
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.640]   who try alcohol and lose control.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.920]   But we can't build a system based upon limiting
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.240]   the average person's behavior based upon somebody
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.560]   who can't control their ability to drink,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.200]   two glasses of wine instead of 20.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.280]   - How does this whole thing end?
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.840]   - Probably in tears.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.960]   - For who?
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.800]   Who's crying?
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.280]   Is everybody crying?
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.520]   - Who's crying when?
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.080]   So I think there were some of the hedge funds
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.240]   that were crying initially.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.960]   That may be some of the Wall Street bets people
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.040]   who bought last would be crying.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.880]   And then eventually there's probably another set
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.120]   of hedge funds or even the Wall Street bets mob,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.280]   and that army, some of them might've broke ranks
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.760]   and then shorted the stock.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.800]   So nobody knows.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.960]   So everybody has to be aware of what's happening in the game.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.920]   So if Wall Street bets said,
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.720]   "Hey, let's squeeze these hedge funds
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.120]   'cause they have too much short interest.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.820]   Let's all buy the stock."
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.360]   Then some of them might've said,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.840]   "Okay, it's at two or $300.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.720]   Maybe I'll join the short movement now that they've covered."
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.640]   And they could have shorted their double agents.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.980]   So people have to understand this stuff is gnarly
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.400]   and it's a free for all.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.880]   I mean, it is a literal free for all.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.480]   - There's a kind of morality,
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.360]   like a big statement that Wall Street bets made
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.720]   in terms of like the elites can't just push us around,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.560]   they can't bully around.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.480]   But at the same time,
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.120]   they're also interested in making money, right?
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.960]   Is, what's your sense?
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.080]   You said that some of the people in the Wall Street bets
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.400]   might've broken off and shorted the stock.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.960]   Are they more interested?
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.320]   There was an emergent morality that emerged
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.000]   and said like, "We're not gonna put up
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.480]   with the centralized elites."
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   But is that going to continue?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.640]   Are they going to fight the power structures
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.320]   that are bad for society?
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.720]   Are they going to now like,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.080]   I mean, are they ultimately going to introduce more chaos
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.480]   that's going to damage the economy and damage the world?
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.560]   Or are they going to continue being the good guys
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   and fighting the evils that manipulate the market?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.760]   What's your sense?
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.300]   - You know, it really feels like
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.960]   the "Dark Knight" series of films
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.760]   where like some people just wanna see the world burn.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.520]   I think there is a contingent of people
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.880]   who just literally want to see chaos.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.640]   Like, you know that contingent on some of these forums
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.320]   who just wanna create chaos, right?
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.160]   So there's certainly that chaos contingent,
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.440]   but I think overall what the arc will show is
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.840]   a group of people getting massively educated.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.520]   You see it in crypto as well.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.260]   There was like a three-year period
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.640]   where all of these failed entrepreneurs who I knew
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.000]   who couldn't build companies were then coming back to me
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.320]   after their companies has failed or after they gave up
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.160]   or couldn't clear a market,
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.380]   raising money with the venture capital community,
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.320]   and they were doing ICOs.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.160]   And I was like, "I met you before, right?"
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.000]   And they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.880]   No, I'm doing an ICO now."
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.040]   I'm like, "Okay, where's your company at?"
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.240]   And they're like, "Here's a white paper."
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.080]   And I was like, "This white paper with spelling errors in it
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.800]   that says you're going to destroy Airbnb
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.360]   because everybody's apartment's
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.340]   gonna be on an immutable ledger."
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.360]   Like, wouldn't that be better in a regular database
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.200]   that was private and not public?
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   Like, why does it need to be on an immutable ledger?
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.040]   It can't change.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.080]   I'm like, "Not changing the database is a feature?
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   That does not seem like a good feature."
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.160]   And they couldn't explain it.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.040]   They were like, "Well, just people are interested in ICOs."
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.800]   And there was that ICO mania.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.360]   And what it showed was there was a global appetite for risk.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.600]   People want to try new things.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   This is one of the great things about the human spirit
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.720]   is one of the great things about capitalism.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.940]   And one of the things that concerns me most
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.800]   about where we're at in society is the sort of socialism,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   communism, entrepreneurship is bad, technology is bad,
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.000]   and polarization of wealth,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.780]   and people getting rich is a bad thing.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.360]   When I grew up, I'm 50 now,
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.120]   but when I was a Gen Xer growing up,
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.800]   we kind of maybe too much idolized Bill Gates
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.600]   and people who were doing interesting things in the world,
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.480]   and we thought capitalism was a force for good.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.200]   I still believe capitalism is a force for good
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.840]   because when a group of people builds a product or service
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.960]   that changes the world and it gets globally distributed,
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.800]   whether it's Tesla, or SpaceX, or Google,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.920]   or Airbnb, or Uber, or Robinhood,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.420]   everybody gets to benefit from that product or service
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.400]   having to compete.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.440]   And if you look at the places where there's no competition,
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.440]   like public education, or less established colleges
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.360]   and stuff like that,
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.960]   less competition for accreditation degrees,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.360]   things tend to get a little weird, don't they?
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.280]   And people tend to be protected, and that's not good.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.720]   You need competition.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.120]   Does it mean that people shouldn't have global healthcare?
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.240]   Does it mean that we shouldn't have a safety net?
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.280]   But we need to keep capitalism vibrant,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.360]   especially because China has now co-opted capitalism
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.920]   and created their own version of capitalism,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.960]   which is communism with capitalism.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.920]   It's like this weird operating system.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.400]   We still wanna keep communism
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.480]   so we can take any of your gains at any time,
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.360]   but we'd like you to be entrepreneurial.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.960]   And then you have somebody like,
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.280]   you know, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.200]   who disappears for a couple of weeks.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.040]   - Who's that?
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.320]   No, I'm just kidding. - Exactly.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.160]   Who's Jack Ma?
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.680]   He kinda disappears for a couple of weeks,
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.520]   and then he comes back,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.400]   and he's really sorry about the things he said,
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.280]   and then he disappears again.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.720]   We have to be very careful.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.400]   If China wins capitalism,
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.640]   this is gonna be an existential threat for humanity.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.680]   The Chinese are no joke.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.960]   I mean, they are seriously focused,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.000]   and they are picking the winners.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.920]   - It's a very weird system because it is, in fact,
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.000]   I don't know what you call it.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.360]   Like communism and capitalism is such overloaded terms,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.360]   but they do encourage entrepreneurship,
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.040]   but they, and they do a good job of it.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.880]   - Oh, yes.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.200]   - But then they're like,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.960]   they're like the surveillance thing,
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.000]   and they're controlling things in a way.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.840]   It's weird because it seems to work really well for them
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.640]   in the short term.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.360]   - Yes, it's definitely got short-term benefits.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.080]   - So the question is like what,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.200]   how that gets distorted and then becomes worse
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.800]   and worse and worse, which it potentially might be.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.980]   And I think on, you know,
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.680]   the entrepreneurial spirit,
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.840]   which you have a podcast all centered
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.800]   around the entrepreneurial spirit,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.200]   is one of the magical things that makes this country great.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   I don't know if money is deeply tied into that.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.280]   I do get bothered by people, you know,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.920]   treating the word billionaire as if it's a bad word.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.760]   - Yeah.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.120]   - But in general, like all the hard things,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.520]   all the difficult things we're going through
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.280]   in this country, it seems like the way out
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   is going to be making the entrepreneur
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.040]   the hero of society, of like letting that young kid
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.200]   with a big dream and the guts to take the big risks
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.800]   and build something totally new,
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.000]   giving them a chance and whatever that involves.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.520]   I don't think it's about taxes.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.720]   I don't think it's about like regulation, all that stuff.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.120]   It's about us and just public discourse saying
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.680]   that that kid, that guy, that girl, they're badasses.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.440]   Like encourage them to do it.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.760]   - We have to have people buy in to the fact
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.640]   that they have that opportunity.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.600]   And I think one of the problems in society
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.840]   is there's a group of people who actually don't believe
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.240]   that they can succeed or they don't believe
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.960]   even more perniciously that other people can.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.280]   And that's the group of people that I think
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.840]   are highly vocal, but a small group of people,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.600]   which are generally people of incredible privilege,
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.360]   rich parents, white city dwellers, liberals.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.120]   They kind of look and say, poor people
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.880]   cannot change a lot.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.320]   And they're battling in their minds to protect poor people.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.160]   But they have this very weird patriarchal
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.240]   kind of approach to it, which is they think
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.720]   that they're not capable of changing their lot in life.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.480]   And they're like, it's not possible.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.240]   And then once in a while, I'll tweet something
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.200]   where I say, it's really incredible
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.800]   that every piece of knowledge you could possibly want
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.840]   is now available for free on YouTube.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.880]   And every course from MIT and Harvard and Stanford
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.240]   is available on edX or Coursera.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.280]   And all that information is there freely available.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.000]   And you can take the lectures.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.840]   This is amazing.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.040]   And then people will be like, yeah,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.360]   but people don't have access to it.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.600]   I'm like, they do, it's free, here's the link.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.400]   And they're like, yeah, but they don't have internet.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   And I'm like, here's the chart of internet penetration
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.240]   in America.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.080]   And they're like, well, poor people don't have internet.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.400]   And I'm like, really?
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.200]   Find me any downtrodden person without a smartphone
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.160]   with a high-speed connection that capitalism provided
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.400]   for $12 a month or $15 a month.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.240]   It's very hard to find that.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.960]   And we have it so well in this country.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.560]   And there's so much opportunity.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.720]   But people don't believe it.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.200]   And that's actually one of the problems.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.440]   See, the average American still watches
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.640]   four or five hours of television a day.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.000]   And often I meet people and they're like,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.600]   I need a technical co-founder.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   But all I need is a million dollars.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.840]   And I'm like, okay, well, what is your skill?
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.280]   And they don't have a skill.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.600]   And I'm like, well, are you a designer?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.440]   No.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.260]   Are you a product manager?
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.100]   No.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.940]   Are you a developer?
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.760]   No.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.600]   Are you a sales executive?
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.440]   No.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.260]   Okay, what are you?
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.100]   It's like, well, I have an idea.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.080]   Well, as my friend Sam Harris,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.040]   I think your friend as well, says,
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.800]   everybody has a million ideas an hour.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.160]   You don't really get credit for those.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.760]   Even when you're asleep, your idea is spewing ideas.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.640]   Like zero credit for your ideas.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.240]   It's all about execution.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.880]   - You have to believe that you yourself
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.840]   can be the core of that execution.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.400]   You yourself can build the thing.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.920]   And no matter what your circumstances are,
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.200]   I mean, we could talk about like structural racism
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.320]   and all those kinds of things that push things down.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   But from the individual perspective,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.680]   when you just like are coaching
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.800]   or giving advice to an individual,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.080]   you can literally change the world.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.160]   I mean, Wall Street Bets is an indication of that
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   in the financial space that you yourself
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.120]   can change the world.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.200]   That's why this country is amazing.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.600]   - Still the best country in the world, right?
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.960]   I mean, it still is amazing the opportunity
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.360]   provided to people,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.440]   all this educational experiences online.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.720]   And the ability, what I tell young people
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.140]   who are looking for advice,
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.880]   I say, you know, the skill you need to refine
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.960]   is the ability to learn new skills.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.160]   Like if you become good at learning a new skill,
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.960]   and Tim Ferriss, a friend of mine,
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.000]   has really pioneered this.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   He can get to 60 or 70% of like the knowledge
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.320]   in a skill in some incredibly short period of time.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.760]   Now I'm not saying he's gonna become a virtuoso drummer
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.800]   or a great basketball player,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.280]   but Tim and I were on vacation together
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.760]   in like a group vacation in Italy,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.560]   and there was a basketball court.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.720]   And I said, "Let's go shoot some hoops."
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.040]   I'd never shot before.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.120]   And I was like, "Okay, come on, I'll teach you."
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.640]   And Tim is fabulously uncoordinated.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.880]   People don't know this.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   Like he tried to dribble a basketball and do a layup,
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.600]   and it looked like he had a blindfold on.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.800]   I mean, you've never seen something less elegant
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.000]   than Tim Ferriss doing a layup in basketball.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.700]   And then he watched me do it three or four times,
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.160]   and I watched him study me.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.280]   And listen, I've been playing basketball in Brooklyn
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.400]   since I was a kid.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.560]   I got a couple of moves,
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.800]   and he was just taking notes and taking notes
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.620]   and taking notes.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.920]   And by the end of a couple of hours of doing this,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.760]   I could just watch him checking his form
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.480]   and figuring it out.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.760]   That's every skill in the world now.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.640]   And what I tell people is like,
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.460]   I'm like, "Did you watch Game of Thrones?"
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.300]   And they're like, "Yeah."
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.600]   "Did you watch Breaking Bad?"
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.440]   Like, "Yeah."
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.480]   I'm like, "Okay, that's about 400 hours."
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.120]   How about you don't watch the next two,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.700]   and you put that 400 hours into learning
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.600]   how to be a graphic designer, a UX person,
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.000]   a developer, whatever it is,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.760]   and learn how to add skills.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   That's what I did my whole life.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.120]   I was a kid from Brooklyn, went to school at night,
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.200]   but I was very quick to get to maybe 50%
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.080]   of the knowledge base of graphic design
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.360]   or being a writer or being a sales executive,
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.520]   whatever it was, a developer even.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.080]   And I was just good enough to not have people
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.440]   be able to bullshit me like when I hired them.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.520]   And that was a big unlock.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.840]   When you know enough that people can't snow you,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   that's a really good one.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.520]   And look at yourself.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.560]   You figured out how to set up an entire podcast.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.400]   People don't know this,
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.240]   but you don't have a team around you.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.680]   I have a team of like five, six people
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.520]   working on my podcast.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.120]   - And if you even know enough about to set this up,
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.000]   you would then be able to hire a team.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.840]   - Correct.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.040]   - And you'll be able to call them on their bullshit
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.720]   if they're not doing a good job.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.560]   And that's really important.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.240]   And I don't know that much about this whole thing,
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.280]   but I know enough to be able to then see
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.960]   who knows their stuff or not.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.800]   You're absolutely right.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.640]   And the process of learning how to learn
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   is essential there because I did martial arts,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.920]   jiu-jitsu and so on.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.400]   And it's so funny to watch.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.240]   - I did Taekwondo, yeah.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.600]   - Taekwondo is awesome.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.080]   It's funny that there's some people
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.560]   that do an activity for years,
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.960]   'cause just sort of elaborate on something
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.880]   you were saying about hours.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.000]   It's not always the amount of hours,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.720]   it's the quality that you put in.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.700]   - Yes, deliberate practice versus just doing some behavior.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.520]   I mean, literally I've been playing chess
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.080]   and trying to get that going again
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.520]   after watching "Queen's Gambit" and I got chess.com.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.720]   And I realized I was just playing
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.540]   and I'm not getting better.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.380]   And then I was like, oh wait,
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.680]   there's a little analysis feature here in chess.com
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.240]   where it will show you your blunders and mistakes.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.480]   And I'm like, oh, I'm spending no time
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.680]   reviewing my losses in chess
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.200]   and I just wanna play the next game.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.960]   I should really review these losses
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.160]   and figure out what mistakes I made.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   And when I started doing that, I was like,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.760]   oh, I'm getting better.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.520]   Right, so some deliberate practice really works.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.240]   - And if you wanna take it all the way,
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.520]   Magnus Carlsen, shout out to the guy,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.280]   has an app, but there's a few other coaching apps
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.960]   where you focus on the end game,
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.400]   you focus drilling a particular,
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.200]   you basically don't play the game at all.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.040]   You just focus on drilling the different aspects.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.360]   - The openings, the end game.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.200]   - The openings, yeah.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.040]   - The end game, yeah.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.860]   - And there's different kinds of puzzles.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.200]   So you can really make it into a deliberate practice.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.840]   - Not to make this episode sponsored by chess.com,
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.320]   but they literally have puzzles.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.160]   So I was like, oh, and it's $100 a year for this product.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.600]   And I just thought to myself, this is capitalism.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.760]   They don't need to charge you $100 an hour for a lesson.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.160]   They can charge you $100 and they've created
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.560]   the ability for you to play chess 24 hours a day
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.120]   against opponents who are perfectly matched against you
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.400]   based on your rating, and they analyze every game,
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.080]   and they have puzzles, and they have tutorials,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.400]   and they've got everything else.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   It's like, just think about how much value
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.520]   is being provided to society because of capitalism
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.580]   and because competition.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.400]   If you want things to get better
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.220]   and you wanna step up your game,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.760]   just make it slightly competitive.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.600]   It is one of these things in human existence
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.120]   that is so powerful.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.200]   I don't know, did you see the Michael Jordan documentary,
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.160]   The Last Dance?
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.520]   - Like half of it, yeah.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.480]   I'm still working through it.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.360]   - He's so competitive and petty.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.440]   It's so inspiring that all he cares about
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.200]   is just winning to the level of which he literally,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.960]   there's this running meme, I took that personally,
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.800]   and I took that personally.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.480]   I don't know if you've seen the images of him
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.720]   sitting smoking a cigar, looking at an iPad
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.960]   or a video clip, and it's like, I took that personally.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.020]   And you can make a super cut
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.840]   of every time he took something personally.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.420]   He literally takes everything personally
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.320]   to give himself that competitive motivation to win.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.920]   That's capitalism.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.080]   And when people are competing,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.640]   man, look at what Elon did to the space of cars.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.360]   Like every, they were literally laughing at him
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.960]   in the first 10 years, electric cars, ha ha,
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.320]   that company will go out of business.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.620]   And now every single company is like,
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.400]   we're going fully electric by 2035.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.240]   And he kicked their asses so brutally
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.800]   that they had no choice but then to step up their game.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.280]   And that's what we want, right?
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.320]   And this virus and this pandemic,
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.880]   I think the great thing that will come out
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.120]   of this horrible experience that we've all had
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.660]   is psychologically, death, learning,
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.100]   just so many bad things occurred,
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.120]   the economy, people losing their jobs.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.840]   But we also got to see the human spirit
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.200]   with these mRNA vaccines and just how,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.440]   if we took out some of the regulation
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.300]   and people were super motivated,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:36.300]   we might actually be able to eliminate all pandemics
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.520]   from ever happening again.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.840]   And before that, Bill Gates was banging his fist
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.720]   and Jeff Skoll was doing the movie "Contagion."
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.960]   I mean, for two decades, people have been banging their fist.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.640]   We have to be prepared for this.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.680]   And everybody's like, yeah, whatever, YOLO.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.800]   It's not gonna happen.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.040]   And now it's happened and people are like,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.920]   we need to be able to destroy every pandemic
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.400]   and virus before it happens.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.580]   And listen, you know a lot more about science than I do,
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.320]   but these mRNA has been around for a while.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.840]   We've just never gotten aggressive about doing it.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.080]   And then you think about challenge trials.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.180]   I don't know if you've been following this,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.600]   but they're doing challenge trials now in the UK this month
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.400]   where they're introducing COVID into healthy young patients
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.840]   and then giving them the vaccine.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.400]   And that is against all rules and regulations
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.200]   about do no harm.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.920]   But then you think about it.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.360]   We kind of celebrate people jumping out of planes
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.440]   and we got that one guy, Alex Honnold,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.200]   who's climbing up mountains without a rope
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.920]   and they give him a Northstar back page ad
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.560]   and an endorsement deal.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.720]   And we celebrate that.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.920]   We celebrate people surfing with sharks.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.420]   We celebrate people doing deep welding.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.320]   We pay them extra to go 200 feet underground
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.600]   and weld stuff.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.820]   And people do dangerous stuff all day long.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.980]   Astronauts.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.640]   Soldiers, firefighters.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.360]   But we won't let people get paid to do a challenge trial.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.640]   - Yeah, we'll rarely risk averse in certain areas
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.880]   that are completely don't make any sense.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.960]   - It doesn't make, and this is where the world needs to be.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.120]   We could have said these thousand people, young people,
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.680]   who we know are in all likelihood
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.440]   not going to have a bad outcome,
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.360]   but there's a possibility.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.200]   - There's a possibility.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.040]   - But it's very low.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   And it's certainly lower than riding a motorcycle.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.240]   It's lower than riding a motorcycle.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.400]   People ride motorcycles everywhere.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.120]   We have ads for motorcycles.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.480]   We could have just said to those thousand people,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.800]   we'll give you a million dollars each to do this.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.120]   Okay, there's your billion dollars.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.040]   We're printing trillions of dollars of money
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:35.880]   to deal with this.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.800]   If we had just done a thousand people
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.880]   for a million dollars each to do a challenge trial
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.800]   in March, April, May, when they had the mRNA vaccines ready,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.480]   we could have deployed the vaccines in the summer.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.160]   We would have been done with this.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.600]   We would have been over by now.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.720]   So we get to challenge all of that thinking.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.520]   I think that's what the Great Pause did.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.240]   It's letting everybody challenge that thinking is,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.640]   why do we have that rule?
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.720]   Okay, yeah, we don't want to have people
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.280]   give up their organs for money.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.540]   We obviously understand,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.040]   but there's a reasonable discussion about,
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.640]   well, maybe there's a level of risk in a global pandemic.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.640]   I mean, we fought the Nazis, right?
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.880]   We defeated the Nazis.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.440]   That took a lot of deaths to do that,
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.920]   but we had to kill that evil.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   This is another evil which we must fight.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.000]   And it's going to result in,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.040]   it's already resulting in thousands of people dying a day,
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.080]   but we could have actually stopped it earlier
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.020]   if we just had a reasonable discussion.
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.560]   This is why podcasting is, I respect what you do,
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.360]   and it's why intelligent people are so drawn to podcasts,
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.000]   because you and I can expand on this
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.400]   and not cancel each other over this very suggestion.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.560]   When I make this suggestion,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.520]   are challenge trials reasonable or not?
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.600]   If I were to do that on Twitter,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.560]   they'd be like, oh, Calacanis wants to give poor people
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.720]   coronavirus in order to save rich people.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.160]   It's like, no, I didn't say that.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.160]   But you and I could have a reasonable discussion about,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.120]   are challenge trials something we should consider
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.520]   in a acute situation where millions of people
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.640]   are going to lose their lives?
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.840]   - Right, so that's an example of capitalism competition
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.120]   working really well.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.320]   There's one of the, to me, sad thing to see
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.080]   about coronavirus is that, for example,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.640]   testing at scale should have, it seems obvious.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.800]   I was a little clueless about it,
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.680]   because I thought there's no way you can have
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.880]   antigen tests at hundreds of millions,
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.080]   order hundreds of millions of them and make them cheap.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.920]   But actually, I realized recently
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.800]   that they've been available since about May.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.400]   You were able to-- - In Korea, in Finland,
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.240]   all over the place.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.960]   - And you could have done mass manufacture.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.480]   So there, there's a little bit of a failure
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.400]   of capitalism to step up.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.320]   And I don't know if you agree with this,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.680]   but it seems that the blame has to be placed
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.320]   at the regulators and the various institutions.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.200]   - Crony capitalism, in all likelihood,
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.880]   is what stopped it here in America.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.760]   I mean, I had friends who had imported them
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.200]   from other countries, the testing kits,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.760]   and you've probably been to parties
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.360]   where people had these kind of testing kits
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.720]   from other countries.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.760]   And we're sitting here and they're just approving them now.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.640]   Really, in February, month 11 of the pandemic in America,
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.800]   we're gonna have testing online, really?
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.400]   I mean, even if these tests were 80% effective,
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.640]   and they're 95% effective, mass producing them,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.800]   we should have sent them in every postal,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   anybody with a post office box should have,
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.640]   with a mailing address, should have had 10 of them
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.520]   put in their mailing address,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.920]   just for free from the government.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.560]   And then everybody would be testing
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.680]   and we would have contained it.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.000]   We don't have test and trace here in the United States.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.480]   All the countries that are on the other side of COVID
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   did it by having testing, tracing,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.600]   and closing their borders and masks.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.480]   That's the combination that works.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.400]   - The problem with the coronavirus is,
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.160]   while there's a lot of institutions
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.640]   that did not behave their best,
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.080]   it's also the case that there's a lot of uncertainty.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.640]   So I tend to give a little bit of a pass
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.680]   to everybody involved for the uncertainty.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.280]   We were all--
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.920]   - I give them that until June.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.560]   - I wonder how history will remember this whole period.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.120]   I'd love to ask you,
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.760]   because you were an early investor in Robinhoods,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   and you're in a very nice place of being a huge supporter
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.080]   of the sort of Wall Street bets
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.040]   kind of distributed power of the people.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.200]   And at the same time,
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.520]   because of you being an investor,
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.160]   like intellectually giving a chance to Robinhood
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.840]   in this kind of chaotic time of conversations
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.520]   to think about like, well, what did they do right?
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.040]   What did they do wrong?
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.360]   So you have a kind of a balance view on the whole thing,
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.080]   which is really nice.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.400]   We've talked about what Robinhood did right, I think.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.400]   Can you sort of steel man Chirmoth's arguments
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.560]   of what Robinhood did wrong in the last few days?
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.000]   - Yeah, I mean, communication is always the number one issue
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   with these startups, right?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.400]   And you have to get ahead of any problem,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.240]   and you have to put all the bad news out immediately.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.020]   And in the case of Robinhood, it seems,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.640]   based on what has been in the papers
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.160]   and what Robinhood said publicly,
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.560]   is that they had this kind of liquidity crisis, right?
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.200]   Where they were being, because of these exchanges telling
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.240]   them you have to put up this amount of money in collateral
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.040]   and them being pinned at number one in the app store.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.000]   There were so many people trying to buy five shares
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.700]   of this stock, five shares of this meme stock,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.440]   that it kind of broke their system.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.360]   And then the people who clear the trades for them,
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.140]   they said, you got to put up a billion dollars,
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.280]   $2 billion, $3 billion.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.920]   We can't do that overnight.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.600]   And I think that they were in an uncomfortable situation
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.560]   of going on TV and saying, we have a liquidity crisis.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.880]   Like, that could be like a run on the bank.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.280]   Everybody then logs in at the same time to Robinhood
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.520]   and tries to sell every share they own,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.640]   'cause they're afraid that the whole thing's
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.480]   gonna collapse, right?
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.440]   So I think there was this kind of like black swan event,
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.160]   and they probably didn't communicate it all that well.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.280]   - At the center of that, this is really interesting.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.680]   Maybe you can comment on the nature of communication.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.440]   Vlad, the CEO, the guy you met at the bar,
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.360]   was at the, I think, at the center
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   of the communication, right?
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.200]   - Yep.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.760]   - So Elon is an example of a guy who also is at the center
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.320]   of the communication for his particular set of companies.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.240]   And that, on Twitter, seems to be a really powerful way
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.600]   to communicate.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.160]   And there was something, this is me saying it,
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.800]   there was something about Vlad that sounded
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.640]   like he's hiding stuff.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.720]   As opposed to Elon, it doesn't sound
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.880]   like he's hiding stuff.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.480]   It could be the nature, the beat,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   the timing of the conversation.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.200]   Same thing with Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.840]   Mark Zuckerberg, for some reason,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.080]   often sounds like he's hiding something.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.520]   And then there's like Jack Dorsey is much less so.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.880]   And I don't know what that is about the CEOs
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   that makes you trust them and not--
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.800]   - Might be the point in time,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.480]   like in terms of escape velocity.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.200]   There might be non-disclosures in place
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.320]   that we're not aware of, where they're not allowed
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.680]   to talk about certain relationships.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.520]   - I see.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.520]   And that results, like in Vlad's case,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.760]   and that results in you being like acting weird
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.440]   and nervous. - Or opaque, or nervous.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.160]   Yeah, it could just be the person is nervous.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.400]   So it's really hard to be building one of these companies
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.960]   and you're at scale and, oh my Lord,
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.400]   the entire thing's coming apart
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.240]   and you're the most hated person for that day.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.600]   You know how the rage cycle works
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.560]   and the media is just so crazy
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.360]   when they get their hooks into something.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.640]   I saw it happen with Uber, we saw it happen with Facebook,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.720]   and even Tesla.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.880]   There were times when people did stupid things
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.520]   with autopilot and it's like,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.920]   okay, somebody's watching a movie and sleeping in their car
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.280]   or leaving the driver's seat
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   against all the rules of autopilot
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.840]   and somehow Tesla's responsible for that?
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.960]   It's like, we have people who stand on top
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.680]   of their motorcycles and drive down the road
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.760]   on a motorcycle and we don't blame Yamaha
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.520]   or Harley Davidson for some idiot standing
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.960]   on the seat of their motorcycle on a highway
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.840]   going 60 miles an hour.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.000]   We just say, that person's an idiot.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.160]   But when new technology comes out,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.720]   we blame the technology, not the person operating it.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.520]   And if you are going to operate,
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.000]   we basically vilify it and demonize it.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.400]   I think that is part of it.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.920]   When the person at, I remember Airbnb,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.640]   we always thought, what if somebody trashes your apartment?
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.360]   And then sure enough, a bunch of meth heads
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.960]   rented this poor woman's apartment,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.280]   she left all of her stuff in it,
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.060]   and then a bunch of meth heads had a drug party,
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.840]   destroyed her apartment, ripped up all her photos,
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.320]   and went crazy.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.360]   And we knew that day would happen,
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.320]   but nobody remembers it now.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.420]   But it was the number one story on every news channel
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.480]   because, wow, that's an exciting story.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.240]   And I just thought to myself,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.880]   I wonder if there are any parties in hotel rooms
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.040]   where the hotel room's being trashed
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.360]   and people are doing drugs and crazy things.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.920]   It's like, yes, that's basically every hotel
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.220]   in Los Angeles right now is being destroyed
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.200]   by some rock band that's throwing a TV out the window.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.160]   Like we expect it in a hotel,
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.000]   we just didn't expect it in somebody's house with Airbnb.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.040]   And then Airbnb created rules around,
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.440]   you can't rent an Airbnb for a party.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.360]   And they learned.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.640]   So I think there's a learning curve with these companies,
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   and they do get to scale at a level that is unprecedented.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.400]   It used to take decades for a company
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.140]   to become an international phenomenon.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.400]   Now it happens in two, three, four years.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.440]   I mean, look at Clubhouse.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.040]   This thing went from being a private beta six months ago
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.200]   to being the number one app in Germany and in Japan and here.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.940]   Like just like that, boom.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.160]   And it's because there's an ecosystem
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.360]   that has never existed, the app store.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.200]   Then there's payments online.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.000]   And then everybody has a supercomputer in their pocket.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.120]   When we, the thing people got wrong
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.520]   about entrepreneurship technology and business,
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.720]   you know, over the last couple of decades
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.000]   was just how big the market was
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.320]   and then how quickly you could, you know,
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.220]   achieve relevancy in these markets.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.960]   We thought the market was like
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.900]   the 60 million homes with broadband.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.680]   And originally it was like maybe 10 or 20.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.000]   Then it became 60 million.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.960]   Then it was like, okay, well, how many hours
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.080]   are you at your desktop computer?
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.200]   Well, like probably at our computers for five hours a day,
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.480]   10 hours a day at work, three hours a day on our own.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.320]   And then it was like, yeah,
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.480]   nobody's on their desktop computer.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.760]   Everybody's on their mobile phone.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.480]   And oh, and by the way, they have it with them.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   So the people with mobile phones
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.200]   are now using this high-speed device
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.960]   with an app store with their credit card in it.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.320]   In the early days of the internet,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.420]   people were scared to put their credit card on the internet.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.200]   That was considered a really dumb thing to do.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.360]   If you put your credit card on the internet,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.320]   you're gonna lose all your money.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.240]   They're gonna hack you or whatever.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.920]   And now it's just amazing to me
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.080]   how quickly when a company hits,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.500]   how quickly it can get to a million subscribers
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.120]   or 10 million or a billion users, right?
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.240]   - And there's all these networks,
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.260]   like social networks that allow the spread of,
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.080]   the viral spread of like a new startup,
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.520]   a new company, a new app to be announced.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.720]   - A meme, anything.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.120]   An idea, a podcast, right?
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.800]   Like I mean- - Single thing,
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.160]   a single meme could change the world.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.320]   Speaking of Clubhouse, I just wanna,
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.720]   we're saying so many interesting things,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.940]   but there was a magical moment with Vlad and Elon
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.780]   on Clubhouse.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.620]   - That was wild.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.620]   - Yes, is there, do you have thoughts about that interaction
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:17.040]   which felt like so many aspects of this whole situation
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.120]   feels like totally novel, surreal,
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.080]   like it's defining some new era.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.040]   - It is, yes.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.920]   - Like a billionaire, the richest human on earth
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.240]   is interviewing the person at the center
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.320]   of one of the most interesting mass scale
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   like power battles in finance ever, perhaps.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.720]   - By the way, seven movies have been sold.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.560]   - And just- - Two weeks.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.160]   Just think about how fast things are moving, Lex.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.280]   This thing happens.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.400]   Like people had the idea to short the stock six months ago.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.340]   They start doing their research, they build an army,
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.080]   they execute the trade, the system goes down.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.080]   Robinhood raises three and a half billion dollars
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.580]   in four days.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.220]   Elon is interviewing them on Clubhouse on Sunday
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.480]   after the Wednesday it happened.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.040]   And now here we are, it's 10 days later.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   Doesn't it feel like it's been 10 months?
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.280]   It's been 10 days, Lex.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.280]   - It's been 10 days.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.120]   - 10 days.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.320]   - Plus there's like a new president,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.000]   all these things, and everyone forgot.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.520]   - Oh, and there was an insurrection.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.840]   By the way, we also have a revolution at the Capitol
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.200]   where a bunch of crazy people who have guns
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.640]   and body armor, and then a bunch of them
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.760]   who are just YOLOing in cosplay took over the Capitol.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.280]   - Well, so, and the other more dramatic thing to me is-
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.200]   - That was one month ago.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.160]   - That was one month, and the president
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.880]   of the United States got banned
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.360]   from every major social network,
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.080]   and which I think I'm still deeply troubled by
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.720]   is Parler being removed from AWS.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.480]   That changed the way, that changed a lot of things.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.400]   As somebody who's an aspiring entrepreneur,
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.240]   that changed the way I see the world.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.880]   That little, maybe I'm being overdramatic, but-
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.720]   - No, you're not.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.840]   I think you're paranoid for a reason.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.640]   You're paranoid for a very good reason,
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.880]   which is as big as these companies can become,
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.800]   they are beholden to the mob.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.560]   And if the mob says, "Hey, this person needs to be canceled,"
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.000]   they're going to get canceled
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.400]   because you can't lose your entire audience.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.800]   You could lose your whole customer base,
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.640]   and you could lose all your employees.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.200]   I think what's interesting about your fear
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.920]   about Parler and AWS taking off
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.000]   is we went from being a social network,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.640]   which is the software layer,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.000]   and then we went to the infrastructure layer,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.240]   and they'll even go after Cloudflare,
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.720]   which is a CDN provider.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.680]   They're just a plumbing, it's sort of like the telephone.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.640]   So we're basically holding everybody responsible
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.920]   on the whole chain of events here.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.480]   And what that's going to do is,
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.080]   I'm not a huge believer in crypto,
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.120]   but distributed computing,
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.160]   where nobody, and decentralized
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.360]   and distributed computing platforms, and open standards.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.840]   Podcasting's an open standard.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.960]   The web is an open standard.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   FTP was an open standard.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   But Twitter and Facebook are closed.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.720]   And what's going to happen is,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.760]   we will see a group of individuals
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.960]   create peer-to-peer networks for social media
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.200]   where nobody can control it.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.960]   And the same for cloud computing,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   where there's a crypto project where everybody will,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.120]   and I invested in a company that tried to do this
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.320]   and got sold and it didn't work out.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.160]   But take your hard drive on your computer at home,
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.320]   you give a terabyte of your 10 terabyte drive
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.480]   over to the cloud.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.000]   And then everybody else does their terabyte.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.360]   And then all of a sudden you've got this virtual cloud,
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.720]   and anybody can store stuff on it,
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.920]   and it's all encrypted, and then nobody can stop it.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.680]   And that could be tweets, it could be videos.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.480]   And so this idea that YouTube
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.080]   will be able to tell people,
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.960]   to kick people off because they're skeptics of,
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.640]   I don't know, the pandemic or the vaccine,
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.120]   or they've, you know,
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.240]   they'll make things that are more censorship resistant.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.960]   I think that'll be the reaction to all of this.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.640]   - Well, this is my question for you,
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.720]   going back to that crappy bar and people pitching you.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.680]   Is there, like with Clubhouse, do you see competitors?
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.240]   Do you think it's possible that another,
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.160]   perhaps more decentralized,
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.280]   or another kind of social media will emerge
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.880]   that will take on Twitter and Facebook,
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.320]   and might be able to replace them?
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.120]   If you look at the whole landscape,
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.520]   with Clubhouse and everything else,
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.520]   do you think some other company might emerge?
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.200]   - There'll be 10 versions of Clubhouse.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.400]   We looked at social networking,
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.840]   we thought Friendster was it.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.080]   Like Friendster was so good,
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.040]   nobody would be able to compete with that,
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.240]   it was growing so quickly.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.880]   And then MySpace was a juggernaut,
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.520]   and they hit a hundred million in revenue,
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.600]   and a hundred million users.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.880]   And it was like, well, that's game over.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.000]   And then Facebook, and LinkedIn, and Snapchat,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.440]   and FriendFeed, and countless others.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:50.560]   So there's usually 20 people who will win in a category,
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.320]   and 80% of the category will be owned
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.080]   by the top two or three players.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.400]   - But will those players change, do you think?
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.240]   What's your sense of that?
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.080]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.400]   I mean, if Facebook hadn't bought Instagram,
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.960]   it would be a company in decline right now.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.280]   People would be shorting the stock, right?
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.120]   Facebook peaked and then was sort of heading down,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.280]   and Instagram saved them, and WhatsApp saved them.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.360]   So that's another kind of weird moment in history,
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.600]   that they were able to accumulate that much power,
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.840]   and consolidate that much power.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.280]   Instagram should have never sold to them.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.120]   That should have gone public.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.160]   They had just raised money from Sequoia,
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.200]   and they had raised $50 million
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.760]   at a $500 million valuation,
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.840]   and they didn't need to sell.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.120]   And that was a big mistake to sell.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.960]   They should have kept going,
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.600]   and they should have took on Facebook.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.560]   And if Instagram was a standalone company right now,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.240]   it'd be worth 500 million.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.120]   - Do you think-- - 500 billion, yeah.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.640]   - Do you think Facebook might buy Clubhouse?
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   Has been--
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.760]   - They'll probably copy it.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.760]   Zuckerberg has no moral compass, or ethics, or anything.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.280]   He's a marauder.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.640]   He basically copied Snapchat seven times.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.440]   He did poke, and he just kept trying,
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.600]   and trying, and trying.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.800]   Part of the reason why the WhatsApp founders,
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.920]   and the Instagram founders left,
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.200]   is they found Zuckerberg so distasteful,
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.240]   in terms of his ability to copy.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.760]   - What do you think makes a great leader in that sense?
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.520]   Okay, so when I look at Zuckerberg--
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.960]   - He's a great executor.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.800]   - Is he a great executor?
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.120]   - But I don't think he's a great leader.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.680]   I was bullish on, I was excited about Facebook
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.440]   in the very early days.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.480]   I thought it was an exciting opportunity to connect people,
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.760]   and stuff started going wrong in certain kinds of ways.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.280]   And again, maybe it's our human nature,
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.360]   but I attribute a lot of that to the leadership.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.280]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.080]   I mean, the guy started it because he was unable
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.360]   to ask girls if they were single and on a date.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.200]   I mean, that was his explicit--
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.120]   - That could be a good motivator.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:33.960]   That could be a good motivator.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.080]   - Well, I mean, it does, I mean,
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.760]   the motivation of 18, 19-year-old men is,
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.640]   yeah, pretty clear.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.880]   He was just trying, he had no game.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.640]   He had no game, and he needed to know who was single
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.160]   so he could at least have a shot at getting a date.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.440]   - It's a little creepy, a little creepy, yeah.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.860]   - You know, he, I think, was so obsessed
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.080]   with engagement and winning,
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.320]   and he's kind of like one of those friends you have
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.200]   who's just really good at playing a video game,
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.240]   but maybe doesn't see the bigger picture in life.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.400]   And I mean, there's a reason why everybody
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.520]   who worked for him hates him,
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.760]   and doesn't talk to him anymore,
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.080]   and then actively derides him.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.720]   Like, so many, the people who sold WhatsApp to him
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.360]   then backed other projects like Telegram
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.040]   and said horrible things about him on the way out,
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.720]   these are the people he made billionaires,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.200]   and they really don't like him.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.800]   So I think there is something that he does
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.440]   that does not breed loyalty,
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.600]   but he's very successful in his focus,
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.320]   which is growth is all that matters.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.540]   He's a marauder, and taking friction
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.080]   out of products and processes is the playbook
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.380]   of Silicon Valley for the last decade or two.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.220]   So whatever the friction is--
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.560]   - I love the poetry of what you're saying right now.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.800]   It's like you're speaking so fast
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.560]   that I almost forget that you're dropping bombs.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.720]   But so removing friction,
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.440]   and you're saying Facebook is exceptionally good
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.960]   at removing friction. - He was the best at it.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.360]   I mean, at Uber, they were like,
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.720]   we're gonna take out tipping,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.520]   we're gonna take out the need for you
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   to take out your credit card and do payment.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.260]   It's just gonna be in your wallet.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.080]   You got picked up, you leave, that's it.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.240]   And I was like, we should have tipping,
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.040]   and they're like, it adds a step,
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.800]   and we're trying to have no steps.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.100]   You put your address in, you click the button,
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.580]   and you do nothing else.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.380]   And so we've been obsessed here in Silicon Valley
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.100]   is how many clicks can we take out of the process?
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.980]   - I guess Amazon is incredible at that as well.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.700]   - Absolutely, one click was the start of it.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.960]   And then you look at Clubhouse as an example.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.780]   You open Clubhouse and you see rooms,
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.100]   you click on it, you're listening.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.900]   So in one click, you're listening.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.180]   And then in one click, if you raise your hand,
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.940]   you get invited, and you say yes, you're speaking.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.380]   So it's two clicks to speak, one click to listen.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.780]   I mean, the only way they could make that app work
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.600]   even faster is if you opened it up
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.680]   and your microphone was turned on,
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.760]   which is kind of scary, but that is the next evolution.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.880]   And what happens when you go that fast
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.960]   is you get unintended consequences.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.240]   And so this is why Facebook has had more fines
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.840]   than any company in the history of Silicon Valley,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.120]   just giant fines for doing stuff like this.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.280]   And one of them was, I don't know if you remember
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   when they created groups,
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.320]   or if you have a group for your podcast,
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.440]   but you can just add people to a group
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.240]   without their permission.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.500]   And there was this famous case
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.760]   when they first came out with it.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.700]   Somebody created a Nambla fake group,
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.060]   National Man Love Boy Association or whatever,
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.060]   like pedophilia association.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.420]   And they added Zuckerberg, Mike Arrington, myself,
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.160]   and like 20 other famous people in Silicon Valley.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.180]   And I was like, and then somebody takes a screenshot of it
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.220]   and they're like, you're in Nambla?
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.560]   And I'm like, no.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.020]   Facebook allowed you, and then Zuckerberg's response was,
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.940]   well, if your friends put you in that Nambla group,
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:27.780]   you should get new friends.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.580]   And it was like, you got put in there too.
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:30.820]   - Yeah.
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.460]   - And then the sad part about it was
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.500]   there were a group of young men who were gay
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.540]   and who were in college,
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.460]   and there was a gay choir in their college.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.620]   And the person who was coordinating their Facebook group
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.700]   added them.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   So Zuckerberg, it wasn't enough for Zuckerberg
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.020]   to make it so anybody could add anybody to any group
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.620]   because it will grow faster,
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.780]   let alone you have to confirm
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.500]   you want to be added to the group.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.680]   What it also did was posted it on their walls
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.820]   to increase engagement.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.620]   And what they inadvertently did was
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.100]   they outed a bunch of 18, 19 year olds in college
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:01.940]   to their families
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:06.420]   because they joined the gay men's choir at some college.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.660]   And this is the kind of way,
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.060]   this is where Silicon Valley needs to check itself
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.460]   and to do better,
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.700]   is you have to really think,
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.900]   well, there is my incentive to grow faster,
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.500]   and then there's what's right for society
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.340]   and for the individuals.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.940]   You gotta think it through, think it through.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.780]   - It's sometimes very difficult.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.500]   This is where vision is required
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.500]   to anticipate the unintended consequences.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.940]   It seems like Mark Zuckerberg is not very good at that.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:37.140]   You've talked to so many great leaders in this world,
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.300]   privately and publicly.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.340]   What do you think makes a great leader
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.500]   of these tech companies?
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.260]   Do you have an example?
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:47.300]   Is Elon to you a great leader?
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.500]   He's also a controversial one, right?
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.300]   - Yeah, I mean, he's got a sense of humor.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.820]   - Controversial in the sense that there is,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.100]   and I know a lot of people who've worked with him, for him,
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.220]   that there's also a love-hate relationship.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.660]   The hate comes from the fact
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.620]   that they get pushed extremely hard.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.500]   It's a very competitive environment,
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:12.220]   but it's a positive one because there's a vision
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.060]   that's underlying.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.020]   It's similar to the Steve Jobs thing.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.020]   And it has to do with,
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.860]   back to our Michael Jordan discussion as well,
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.260]   that there seems to be the demons involved in tension
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:27.820]   and just anxiety, all those kinds of things.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.060]   - If you wanna do great things,
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.500]   there will be some suffering,
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.580]   and there'll be some pain,
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.020]   and it's not easy if you wanna change the world.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.980]   And then some people have this expectation
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:40.340]   that it's going to be easy.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.620]   And what you'll typically find for any great leader
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.140]   who's trying to do something super ambitious,
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.620]   like if you wanna be like,
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.740]   if you're a rich guy and you start a restaurant
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.100]   and you don't care about making money,
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.260]   and people have made restaurants before,
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.180]   you could be high fives
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.900]   and everybody could love you or whatever.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.780]   But if you wanna change the world,
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:52:59.900]   you wanna do something hard driving,
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.460]   there's gonna be sacrifice involved.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.340]   And so the problem is people are looking at something
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:10.340]   that is an Olympic caliber sport or a Navy SEALs-like effort.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:13.700]   In other words, an effort that requires massive sacrifice.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.020]   We would not look at somebody who wins a gold medal,
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.380]   like Michael Phelps, and say,
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:20.100]   "Oh my God, he had to get up at 4 a.m. every day,
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.380]   and he had to swim and he had to do an ice bath.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.780]   Oh my God, that poor guy, he suffered, he was tortured."
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.700]   People were super mean to him,
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.540]   they put him in an ice bath.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.260]   It was like, "No, he wanted to be the greatest swimmer
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.180]   of all time, and he knew what the sacrifice entailed."
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:37.180]   And then what happens in work, in business,
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.300]   is that people conflate like,
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.060]   "Oh, well, I went to work to make a living to pay my bills,"
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:47.620]   versus Michael Phelps' approach to getting gold medals,
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.900]   or Michael Jordan, or pick the person, Elon, or Jeff Bezos.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.140]   And when you look at the reviews of a place like Amazon,
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.340]   there was this incredible story in the New York Times
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.700]   where people were, I don't know if you remember it,
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.420]   "This is the worst place you could ever work, Amazon."
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.620]   And we talked to 200 people, and they all told us,
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.140]   they all described for us in the New York Times
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:10.180]   a culture of cutthroatness and brutality
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.900]   that has never before been seen.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.900]   And then you see all these people who worked for Bezos
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.380]   for 24 years, from when they graduated with their MBAs
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.940]   until today, and they've never left the company,
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:23.580]   and they are ride or die forever.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.260]   And what you're seeing there is,
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.300]   there's a mismatch of people going to work
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.780]   in an extreme sport or an extreme endeavor
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.340]   who should not do that.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:37.980]   There are people who should go out into the rice fields
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.940]   and pick rice, and then there's another group of people
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.980]   who are samurai and who wield a sword
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.420]   and who take on missions that are dangerous.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.780]   But if you're a rice picker and that's what you do,
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:54.100]   and you feel safe just getting a couple of grains of rice,
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.740]   put them in a basket, cleaning it, and then whatever,
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.700]   that's valid work, no big deal.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.300]   I'm not deriding it, I am sort of.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.380]   But that is one group,
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.980]   and then there's people who are samurai.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.020]   And you cannot conflate the two,
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.140]   you cannot compare the two.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.740]   And that's what is happening right now in business.
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.340]   Whenever you see these stories about,
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.820]   this person at this company is a tyrant
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.260]   and they're so horrible and they yelled at somebody,
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.340]   like if you're in the field
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:22.300]   and you're taking the beach at Normandy and it's D-Day,
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.940]   or you gotta take the hill
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.860]   or you gotta whack Osama bin Laden
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.460]   and you're the Navy SEALs and a rotor gets knocked off
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.380]   the back of the Black Hawk, this is serious shit.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.580]   Don't do it if you're not serious.
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.700]   And if you're not serious about changing the world,
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.500]   why would you go work for Bezos?
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.900]   Why would you go work for Elon Musk?
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.260]   Don't do it, don't go work there.
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:49.940]   - Let me just sit back and enjoy the beauty of all of that.
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.020]   That's music to my ears,
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.660]   but I'm not sure what to do with it
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:57.660]   because it's conflicting to a lot of the things I hear
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.340]   from the way you're supposed to kind of act.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:05.100]   I think in order to do great things, you have to,
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.580]   I always admired people that lose their shit a little bit
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.340]   because they're so passionate.
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:14.460]   And I apologize and all those kinds of things,
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.900]   but there's a tension,
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.740]   there's a drama to the creative process
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.860]   when especially in the early startup,
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:26.420]   this is not like the work-life balance idea.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.260]   It doesn't even apply.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.820]   - Work-life balance, ridiculous.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.260]   It's a ridiculous concept.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.340]   The idea that there's work-life balance
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.620]   in a startup is ridiculous.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.700]   If you're looking for work-life balance,
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.740]   do not go to a startup or any kind of ambitious company.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:43.340]   There is a series of places you can work in the world
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:46.980]   where you do not need to do anything more
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.460]   than what's put in front of you.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.380]   And you just put the round peg in the round hole
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.220]   and the square peg in the square hole, Paul,
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:59.220]   and you go home and you get your little bits,
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.380]   grains of rice and you go heat them up and eat them.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.300]   That's it.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.400]   And then there's this other thing,
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.620]   which is the extreme pursuit of changing the world
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.120]   and sacrificing.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.220]   And we have a generation of people,
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.300]   multi-generations of people who are soft.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.140]   They're just soft.
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.820]   I mean, what is the big struggle we've had to deal with
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:19.540]   in America in our lifetimes?
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.740]   Like 9/11 and we didn't have the Vietnam War
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.500]   and then we had this weird Iraq Wars
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:26.180]   and Middle East Wars that were kind of like
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.540]   a small number of people went and we sent drones.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.460]   We have not had to sacrifice.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.340]   Gen Xers, maybe the tail-end of boomers
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.760]   experienced the Vietnam War, regrettably.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.900]   But we've had a couple of generations now,
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.740]   three, I guess, that just haven't had to suffer.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.800]   And so we're soft as Americans, we're soft.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.860]   And then you look at people in China and we're like,
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.220]   oh my God, these poor Chinese people
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:49.200]   are living in these tiny cramped apartments.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   They were living in essentially lean-tos in Northern China
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.820]   with no running water or one spigot of ice-cold water
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.300]   for the entire village.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.100]   They're thrilled to be joining the middle class,
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.580]   even if it's the bottom of the middle class.
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.520]   They've taken hundreds of millions of people in China
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.660]   and moved them into the middle class.
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.380]   And we're like, oh my God, these people are suffering.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.500]   It's like, you know, they're up to $4 an hour,
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.620]   three or $4 an hour in the factories there.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:18.020]   And they were just two decades ago at, you know,
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.980]   I don't know, it was probably 50 cents an hour,
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.480]   something crazy like that.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.420]   And now they've improved the quality of life there so much,
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.100]   just like America did 200 years ago or 100 years ago.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.300]   They've improved it so much in China
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.540]   that now they're getting outpriced for factories
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:37.080]   from Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India,
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:41.120]   and people in China are moving the factories out of China
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.520]   into other countries.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.360]   - Yeah.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.200]   - Because the Chinese are now outsourcing to Vietnam
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.040]   and other countries.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.680]   So this is the way of the world.
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.160]   You know, people move up and they get a better lot in life
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.000]   for their families.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.560]   And just in America, we've gotten soft.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.520]   And there's a generation.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.120]   How do people die in America now?
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:01.460]   Suicide, obesity, heart attacks, anxiety.
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.260]   I mean, we're suffering from things
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.000]   that if you told people 100 years ago
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.280]   that the top ways Americans would die
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:13.580]   would be overeating and suicide, they'd be like, what?
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.720]   You're literally killing yourself
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.680]   or eating yourself to death?
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.000]   That's what's happening in America?
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.800]   - And when everybody, not everybody,
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.680]   unmasks there's a large number of people
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.000]   who have become softer and softer.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.560]   Capitalism creates an environment
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.440]   where there's people that still step up amidst that
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.120]   with a big dream and challenge the conventions
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.560]   and that human spirit just arise above that.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.400]   As Elon's example of that, Jeff Bezos' example.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.640]   - Countless, countless examples.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   - And they push the limits of those of human beings
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.280]   that are willing to step up.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.880]   And I think about sort of how to create a company
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:54.260]   that amidst all of this softness
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.140]   still creates a revolution.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.480]   It's not, it doesn't seem trivial.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.460]   It seems like how do you build a culture
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:05.460]   that's once healthy but also unhealthy
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.080]   in the way that an Olympic pursuit is?
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.520]   - It's all top down.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.880]   Everybody just, you asked earlier what leadership was
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.840]   and I never answered the question.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.420]   I think what leaders do is they set the example.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.720]   They set the bar.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.960]   And if you look at someone like Elon,
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.440]   we're personal friends for 20 years
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.760]   and he is indefatigable.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.040]   Like, I mean, the guy has a stamina that is just phenomenal.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.260]   Like he does not get tired, he works relentlessly
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.040]   and he sets that standard for the rest of the team.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.920]   And I think Bezos is very sharp and likes to debate stuff
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.620]   and is very, you know, and Jobs was just incredible
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.140]   at design and figuring out how to bridge that gap.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.940]   So they just, leaders set the standard.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.260]   They set the standard.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.420]   And you know that your time is over as a leader
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.820]   when you can't set the standard
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.740]   and that's when you have to pass the baton, right?
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.180]   And Bezos did that.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.900]   And Bezos now is saying, you know what?
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.660]   I'm 57, I'm the richest guy on the planet,
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.980]   depending on the week.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.620]   And I would like to do some other challenges
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.880]   but I don't wanna grind it out at Amazon
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.340]   for another 25 years.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.420]   I wanna do other things.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.080]   And so he passed the baton.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.380]   And that's the healthy thing to do in that regard.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.220]   I do think there is a time period
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.900]   in which you can run that hot.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.660]   And then at a certain point, you have to then change.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.420]   Just like an athlete might go to be a coach, right?
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.640]   Or a commentator.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.480]   And so, being an entrepreneur is brutal.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.960]   It's seven days a week, 12 hours a day.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.360]   Anybody who says anything differently
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.680]   is kidding themselves.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.600]   You're gonna have to sacrifice.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.200]   And this competition.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.980]   And America has to fight.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.860]   If America does not win capitalism and China does,
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:47.920]   it is literally the end of the human species.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.720]   It's over for humanity.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.640]   Right now, everything has been going really well
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.720]   in terms of the number of people living in poverty
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.920]   is plummeting.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.200]   Lifespans have been rising.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.160]   Science is booming.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.120]   The economy is booming.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:02.960]   All these things are incredible.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.100]   The one thing that's kind of stagnant right now
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.120]   is the number of people living in democracy
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.520]   versus under authoritarian rule.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.360]   It's flat.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.960]   So when you look at all Steve Pinker's charts
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.440]   and he's really excited,
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.040]   there's one you're gonna see that's flat.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.520]   And I think we peaked with 53 or 54% of people
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.360]   on the planet Earth being in a democracy.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.520]   And now it's going below 50.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.160]   And it's because some of the democratic Western countries
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.420]   don't have the population growth
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.320]   of some of the communist and socialist countries
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.640]   and authoritarian countries.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.000]   And we have to make sure that we win capitalism.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.200]   We must win economically.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.640]   That is the battlefield.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.380]   The battlefield of science, technology,
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.360]   and money, and economy, finance.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.620]   That's the battlefield.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.480]   China wins, authoritarians win.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.000]   And at any time,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.280]   Xi Jinping can pull Jack Ma into a room and say,
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.280]   it's time for you to be re-educated.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.320]   Or they can put three or four million people,
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.240]   Uyghurs, into prison camps and say,
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.720]   you know what, this religious thing,
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.600]   that's counter to what is productive for us.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.480]   Therefore, we're gonna shave your heads
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   and we're going to have you
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.200]   literally pick cotton in the fields.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.880]   They have Uyghurs with no sense of any kind of
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.720]   arc of history in the fields picking cottons
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.160]   as slaves in what can only be described
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.140]   by every humanitarian organization
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.320]   as a concentration camp.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.000]   And every Jewish person I know
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.400]   takes great offense when somebody uses
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.240]   the Holocaust as a metaphor,
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.520]   except in the case of the Uyghurs right now.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.480]   And every Jewish person I've talked to
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.500]   has said to me, that is a Holocaust.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.100]   That is millions of people going to genocide
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.680]   because of their religious beliefs.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.160]   And I'm an atheist,
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   but if people wanna believe a certain religion, fine.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.800]   But China's approach is,
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.200]   we need to win capitalism so bad,
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.560]   we need to win on the global stage so bad,
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.560]   we can't have any of this religious stuff going on here.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.440]   That is a distraction from winning and beating America.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.680]   And then in America,
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.080]   the people who are gonna make us win are the entrepreneurs
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.560]   and the scientists and the technology
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.400]   and our education system and finance.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.880]   And we're vilifying those things.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.460]   It's pretty dark.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.320]   - It's dark, but I still believe that
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.600]   the vilification is just in the space of Twitter
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.440]   and the space of ideas.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.260]   - I think that's probably a good--
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:14.560]   - And entrepreneurs win out in the end.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.400]   They don't listen to any of that.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.240]   - I believe we'll win.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.760]   - And they'll build, we'll get the rocks.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.680]   - Some of them do actually, in their darkest moments,
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.640]   I can tell you that they turn off their Twitter accounts
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.280]   and they, I've had to sit down
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.160]   with a number of entrepreneurs and say,
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.560]   "Turn off Twitter.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.340]   "This is not healthy for you.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.680]   "This is not a healthy pursuit."
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.340]   Because don't read the comments.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.120]   If you do, it's like a full contact sport.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.760]   You should just take it as like
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.160]   professional wrestling or something.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.080]   But stay focused on building companies
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.840]   and advancing the human species
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.160]   through science and technology.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.000]   I mean--
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.920]   - As you're describing,
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.080]   you've hosted this week at Startups
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.440]   for how many episodes?
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.200]   - 11 years, almost 1,200 now.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.040]   - 1,200.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:52.860]   - Yeah.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.480]   - So you've talked to some of the great leaders
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.240]   in business in general.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.240]   Is there a common thing that you see or--
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.900]   - Really messed up relationship with their parents.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.360]   Like just, "Find me a great entrepreneur.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.440]   "I will, show me the trauma."
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.400]   Their dad was like, "You're not good enough."
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.280]   - In the teenage years, is that truly, is there something--
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.640]   - There is definitely something to--
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.680]   - A hardship at some point in their life?
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.640]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.000]   I mean, and there's definitely something
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.920]   with immigrant parents.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.840]   That is a bit of a stereotype out here.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.320]   But I've heard from many investors,
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.960]   like that's like their,
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.560]   oh, were your parents immigrants?
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.520]   And did they beat into you that you have to succeed
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.280]   and you feel the need to succeed
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.000]   because they suffered to get you to this country?
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.840]   Like there is an archetype there that I hear.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.880]   When I started investing, I heard from a lot of people.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.120]   It's like, yeah, you wanna find those immigrant founders
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   who are coming out of Stanford
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.840]   'cause they had to fight to get there.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.000]   And their parents had to fight, right?
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.560]   So it's like two huge fights and there's so much at stake
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.440]   as opposed to somebody who's fifth generation
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.920]   and had everything handed to them and they were legacy
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.000]   and got into schools for free.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.320]   But I think in general,
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.680]   the ability to get people to join you on that journey
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.120]   is so critical.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.320]   So you have to be charismatic
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.360]   and it doesn't mean like you're an extrovert.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.240]   There are introverts who are super charismatic.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.640]   Oh, and there are soft-spoken people.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.120]   They don't have to be like super vivacious
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.600]   or rambunctious people.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.080]   They could be just quiet assassins,
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.880]   but you need to be able to get people
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.000]   to come on the journey with you.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.720]   You have to be that storyteller
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.840]   and you have to have that passion
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.760]   and then you have to transfer that enthusiasm to investors,
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.960]   the press, to customers, to all the stakeholders.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.240]   And if you're enthusiastic about it and you're engaged,
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.200]   then it's easier for people to come on that journey.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.680]   And that's why people really start to think about,
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.840]   well, what is the purpose of what I'm doing?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.000]   And it sounds corny.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.160]   And when I first heard that, I was like, it's kind of corny,
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.960]   but then I read this book by,
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.520]   I've got his name, Rick something.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.000]   He wrote "The Purpose-Driven Church"
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.640]   and he had spoken at a TED or something
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.920]   and everybody went crazy about it.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.640]   And he's like, a church should have one purpose,
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.480]   one single thing they do.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.960]   And like his church,
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.400]   which was like one of these mega churches in San Diego,
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:05.760]   just wanted to do education for this specific country
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.800]   and that's all they did.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.360]   And they benchmarked those.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.640]   I think it's very important to have a purpose and a mission,
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.560]   not everything,
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.320]   but a specific purpose of some kind of joy
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.600]   that you want to put into the world.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.360]   You want to solve some kind of big, hard problem.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.040]   And then everybody knows
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.880]   why you're coming to work every day.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.920]   And then for the founder,
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.600]   when you dread going to work that day
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.760]   and you don't feel like solving that problem anymore,
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.160]   that's the tell.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.480]   And a lot of times I meet young founders,
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.320]   I'm like, why are you doing this?
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.240]   And they're like, well, I was looking for an idea
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.360]   and this is the one I came up with
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.560]   'cause I think I'll make a lot of money.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.080]   And it's like, you're gonna quit.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.880]   You're gonna get to month nine or 10 of this
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.400]   and you're gonna run out of money
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.440]   or like your CTO is gonna quit,
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.760]   then your CFO is gonna quit
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.140]   and you're gonna lose your biggest customer
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:51.480]   and you're just gonna say this is not worth it.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:57.600]   And if using Bezos or Elon as examples,
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.600]   they just needed to see the world change
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.360]   for in very specific ways.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.600]   And Steve Jobs, they needed to see a change.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.540]   And it doesn't matter if they made money
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.880]   or they were losing or winning,
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.480]   they just went to work every day and they had to change it.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.280]   - It's almost like they didn't have a choice.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.120]   - No choice.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.360]   - Elon makes it sound like his torture, his whole journey,
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.320]   but he can't help it.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.820]   - Having been a witness to it,
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.320]   just as friends for that long,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.280]   I have never seen an entrepreneur suffer more than him.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.920]   And he's been public about that,
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.320]   like you do not wanna be me.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.560]   He has suffered for those companies.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.200]   He has suffered to get them where they are.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.440]   It has not been easy.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.180]   - Can you psychoanalyze Elon in that aspect?
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:42.060]   Like, is it just he can't help it,
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:46.420]   he must see the change that he hopes for in the world?
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.700]   - He's just incredibly hardworking
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.020]   and he's very talented as well.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.820]   I don't think people understand that.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:56.060]   He actually is a really brilliant engineer.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.980]   At the end of the day, he actually knows what he's doing
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.380]   and he asked the right questions.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.860]   I mean, people were kind of aghast
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.100]   that he was asking Vlad such good questions
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.340]   and they're like, "Oh my God,
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.080]   Elon's the best journalist on the planet."
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.960]   And it was like, kind of anybody who knows Elon
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.040]   knows he has great questions.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.260]   I mean, I used to have dinner in LA
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.520]   and my book agent also was Sam Harris's agent.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.080]   Sam and I met through John Brockman
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080]   and we became friends 'cause we lived near each other
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.640]   and I was friends with Elon.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.840]   And then I used to invite them to both dinner in Brentwood
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.120]   'cause one lived in Bel Air, one lived in Santa Monica
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:30.960]   and I lived in Brentwood.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.360]   And we would go to this place, Popone,
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.640]   this Italian restaurant.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.380]   And every Tuesday for years, we would just,
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.980]   the three of us, every other Tuesday or so,
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.180]   we'd have dinner.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.100]   And I'd sit there and Sam wanted to know about AI
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.980]   and Elon's talking about artificial intelligence
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.220]   'cause he's on the board of DeepMind.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:49.300]   And Elon wanted to know about atheism and meditation
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.660]   and all this other stuff that Sam was an expert on.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.380]   I got to sit there and just listen to these two guys talk.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.720]   - And they have both piercing intelligences.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.460]   But Elon, he goes straight to the gut,
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.220]   the questions that no engineer wants to hear
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.860]   is just the basic stuff that,
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.660]   it's like why the hell are you doing it this way
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:15.940]   when the obvious solution is much easier or this or that?
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.780]   Why haven't you tried this?
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.020]   - He can figure things out.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.420]   I mean, he's a problem solver.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.060]   I mean, and that's another thing,
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.620]   I think the great entrepreneurs can look at a problem
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.860]   with very fresh eyes, almost consistently.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:30.100]   And Bezos described that as day one thinking, right?
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.380]   Like just pretend this is day one every day.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.660]   And then other people use the term first principles.
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.380]   But it basically means like when you see a problem,
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.620]   pause for a second and really think through
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.380]   what is the best possible solution here?
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.740]   What are some alternative solutions and get from everybody,
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.980]   like how do we solve this problem?
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.020]   And what people do sometimes, they get in a rut.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.940]   They just come to work and they just go through their email.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.720]   They do whatever they did the day before.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.460]   They don't think, why are we doing this?
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.940]   And is there a better way to do it?
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.900]   Now you can get so obsessive about that
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.100]   that you can over-engineer stuff
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.420]   and you can never actually ship a product.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.620]   So there have to be some pragmatism and some goals
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.340]   and some dates associated with that.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:11.460]   But it is a very cool thing to really think like,
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:14.660]   I wonder if we actually made the batteries ourselves,
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.500]   what that would look like.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.420]   Or I wonder if we could get to two-day shipping,
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.900]   you know, or I wonder if we could do same-day shipping.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.100]   Like you need to have somebody who's willing to say,
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.300]   you know what, fuck it.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.540]   Let's set a crazy audacious goal,
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.300]   two-day shipping of any product,
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.660]   anywhere in the United States.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.180]   And once you throw the gauntlet down like that,
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.020]   now everybody knows they're rowing in the right direction.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.980]   Two-day shipping, Amazon Prime.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.780]   And that's what people didn't realize about Amazon.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:40.060]   The business wasn't shipping all those products.
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.960]   It was getting you to sign up for Amazon Prime.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.280]   Then they have hundreds of millions of people
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.380]   doing Amazon Prime for 10 bucks a month.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.900]   I think globally it's probably cheaper.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.820]   But that was the driver of that business,
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:54.260]   was all of those people, 'cause they would,
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.940]   you're an Amazon Prime subscriber?
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.260]   Do you know how much you pay?
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:58.100]   - No.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:58.940]   - Exactly.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.260]   It started at $50.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.500]   And I think they even had like 40, 50, $60
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.900]   was like the testing in the early days.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.460]   And now it's, I think $149, 12, $13 a month.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.300]   If you pay for the year,
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.860]   I think it goes down to 10 bucks a month, 120.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.700]   And you're like, wow.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.980]   And it's like, yeah, you're paying $13 a month
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:17.900]   for the privilege of shopping at Amazon.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.700]   But you say it's the greatest thing in the world
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.340]   because anything I need, you know,
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.100]   if you forgot a microphone or a cable goes bad
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.460]   or a camera goes bad, you get it here,
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.180]   you know, within a day or less.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.020]   - Yeah.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:29.840]   - It's pretty amazing.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.060]   - You've already been dropping bombs,
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.500]   incredible advice on startups in general.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:38.500]   But let me maybe go straight in and ask,
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.940]   is there advice for somebody that wants to go big,
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.740]   to build the big startup to help them succeed?
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.620]   - Yeah, it's very similar to the advice I give to investors
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.860]   'cause now I teach angel investing
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.700]   'cause there's so many people who wanna invest.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.980]   And so I wrote a book on that, Angel,
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.900]   and then I do a course called Angel University
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.420]   that I teach six times a year.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.340]   And then I have a syndicate called thesyndicate.com
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.260]   where I invest in companies.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.420]   There's 6,500 people who are members of that.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.140]   It's the largest syndicate in the world.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.780]   In fact, the first deal we ever did was calm.com,
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.620]   the meditation app.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.420]   We put $378,000 into it
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.100]   when it was a $5 million product, a $5 million company.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.900]   So we bought six or 7% of the company.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.100]   It's now worth 2 billion.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:15.980]   So you can do the math on that.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.820]   We still own 5%.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.100]   - What year was it?
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:23.100]   - Six years ago, so probably, yeah, maybe 2015, 2014.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.220]   And nobody else would invest in calm.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.060]   - Yeah.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.140]   - But Sam Harris was the reason I did
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:30.620]   because I asked Sam, "Tell me about meditation."
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.740]   And he's explaining it to me.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:32.580]   And I said, "What about this?
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.700]   "Do you have to have a mantra?
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.660]   "How does it work exactly?
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.500]   "I know positive."
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.000]   He was like, "Well, you should just go to UCLA
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.020]   "and talk to Diana Winston."
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.820]   And there's this whole project there.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.300]   And I'm like, "UCLA does meditation?"
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.700]   He's like, "Yeah, there's a mindful institute.
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.820]   "They're teaching people to teach meditation.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.820]   "And they're doing PTSD,
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.420]   "and I'm doing brain scans."
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:50.940]   And I was like, "Oh."
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.900]   And then I talked to the UCLA people,
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:53.740]   and they were like, "It's real.
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.780]   "Like we taught Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.180]   "and Shaquille O'Neal did."
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.220]   That's how they won their championships, they meditated.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.660]   And I was like, "Hmm, if UCLA's doing it,
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.280]   "Sam says it's cool, well, fuck it.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.980]   "I'll put money into that."
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.900]   And that's the second biggest investment in my career
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.860]   after Uber, and it will in all likelihood become the biggest.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.660]   I mean, it's between Uber, Robinhood, and calm.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.060]   And long story short,
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.540]   when I'm teaching people to angel invest,
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:23.940]   there's really two things that you cannot fake.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.940]   One is a product that is built really well.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.180]   So if you look at calm, Robinhood, Uber, Tesla, Amazon,
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:34.220]   these products are transcendent, they're well-constructed,
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.060]   there's craftsmanship to them, they're great products.
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.460]   - So you're saying not fundamentally like the idea,
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.620]   but the execution of the actual craftsmanship
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.500]   of the construction.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.220]   - The actual product is amazing.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.860]   Then there's customers.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.820]   And every business has ultimately a customer,
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.660]   and that customer, if they are in fact delighted
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.740]   by that product, that's the magic.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:02.620]   Because you need a team to build the product,
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.420]   and then you need customers to use the product,
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.260]   and really those three vectors are undeniable.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:12.340]   Now, you can have great teams that build a bad product,
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.260]   doesn't happen too often,
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.000]   or you can have customers who don't like the product,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.380]   but generally speaking, a great team
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.980]   will build a great product, or a good product and iterate,
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.340]   and then eventually delight customers.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.780]   And so most people say the team is the most important,
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:32.060]   but there's a lot of smart people out there,
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.660]   and let's assume that you can raise money for your idea,
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.340]   or you have money, or you can just convince people
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.580]   to do it for free.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.500]   If you make a great product and it connects with users,
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.340]   that's the magic.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.160]   You look at Clubhouse,
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.660]   it's actually a really well-designed product.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.740]   And that product is connecting with customers.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.020]   And if you were to talk to the customers
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.340]   or look at the product,
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.940]   you would see a well-constructed product
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.580]   and a delighted customer.
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.940]   And you can tell the delighted customer
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.660]   by just the amount of time they use it.
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:58.180]   That's called engagement.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.220]   It's a fancy word for how much they use it.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.900]   And Snapchat, when that was going around,
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.580]   and they were trying to raise money,
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.260]   they had a fraction of the number of users,
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:12.100]   but the top maybe third were opening the app every hour.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.000]   And nobody had ever seen that before.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.140]   People were using Facebook a couple of times a day,
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.100]   the top users,
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:22.500]   but nobody had ever seen people using it every day
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.380]   for 100 days in a row, every hour.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.380]   And I was like, "What's going on here?"
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.780]   It's like, "Oh, the ephemeral messaging."
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.060]   And then the streaks.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.700]   They had created these streaks between people
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.420]   where every day, and then people would be on vacation.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.660]   Like, "I just have to open my streak
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:36.740]   "and keep my streak with Lex
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.620]   "that we chatted every day going."
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.300]   And so they had this addictive nature to it.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.420]   And that's why Clubhouse was able
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.240]   to garner so much investment,
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.800]   is the number of hours people were using it every month
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.500]   was just unbelievably off the charts.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.700]   - Some of that is execution,
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.540]   but some of it is the weird magic of the-
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.620]   - Product market fit.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.140]   - Yeah, so there's something.
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.460]   I mean, Clubhouse, there's a,
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.580]   it's still a mystery to me,
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.660]   'cause I also use Discord voice.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.700]   There's that intimacy to voice.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:04.540]   - Oh, for sure.
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.340]   Well, you've got people's, yeah, tent.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.220]   - But the video gets in the way, actually,
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.100]   in a weird way.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.320]   There's a privacy when you just use voice.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.800]   - People are not taking showers now, Lex.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.520]   I mean, we're in a pandemic,
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.680]   and people just roll out of bed.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.360]   - And the hair thing, nobody's getting haircuts.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.440]   - Nobody's hair is good, nobody's getting haircuts.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.120]   People are wearing gym clothes.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.480]   I mean, Zoom is just horrific
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.040]   to be on Zoom for five hours a day.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.360]   It is exhausting.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.000]   - Well, it does make me wonder what,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.660]   once we emerge from the pandemic,
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:36.200]   whether product market fit,
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.280]   how that evolves with Clubhouse
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.200]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.060]   - Yeah, no, Clubhouse is a beneficiary
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.260]   of the pandemic, for sure.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.820]   When do you think the pandemic,
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.420]   when do you think deaths will be under,
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:48.580]   let's say, 200 a day,
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:50.340]   and we'll have 200 million people
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.260]   on the other side of this?
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.620]   'Cause that's kind of what it takes, right?
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.340]   You gotta get to 150, 200 million people
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.780]   on the other side in America?
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:57.140]   - I haven't, you know,
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.180]   I personally stopped deeply thinking about this
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.540]   because I've been frustrated for so long.
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.380]   - Ah, you checked out.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.660]   - I almost checked out
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:10.080]   because it psychologically allows me to carry on
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.240]   because I thought for many months now
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.600]   that testing needs to be done at scale.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.800]   - And it still hasn't gotten done.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.640]   - It hasn't.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.460]   - So ridiculous.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:20.300]   - We gave up, basically, on testing.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.260]   - We gave up?
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.160]   - Because we're all sitting there
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.560]   waiting for vaccine to come along.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.080]   And the distribution of the vaccine is not,
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.200]   you know, it's struggling from the same kind of things
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.040]   as the testing.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.680]   It's gonna take quite a bit of time.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.940]   So it does, if everything goes great,
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.940]   meaning there's not a second strand of the virus
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:44.000]   that's going to create a second major wave,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.600]   that I am cynical enough to think
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.660]   that it won't be until mid-summer
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:51.340]   that we start opening back up.
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.260]   - Yeah, I think it's gonna be May, June.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.660]   I'm a little bit earlier than you.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:55.500]   I've been tracking it.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.820]   It's like 1.5 million shots in arms a day.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.060]   I think this vaccine's been undersold.
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:00.920]   I mean, it's a miracle.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.580]   Not one person who was in the trials died
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.940]   who took it, and only one went to the hospital,
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.080]   and they weren't even put on a ventilator.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.120]   And the hospitalizations are plummeting,
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.400]   and we're at 10% now in the United States.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.820]   At the pace we're going, at 1.5 a day.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.820]   I think when the Johnson & Johnson one comes out next month,
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.780]   it'll be 3 million a day, maybe, 2 1/2.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.100]   And we already have 100 million people
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.020]   who've likely had it.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:22.940]   So I've been doing the math.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:26.420]   I think we're like 60 days away, February, March.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.120]   Yeah, sometime in April, I think,
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.980]   anybody's gonna be able to get a shot,
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:33.380]   and the number of deaths is gonna go below 200 a day.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:34.420]   And once that happens,
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.260]   I think people have had enough of this.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.660]   They're just gonna go YOLO.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.660]   - But see, the crucial piece for me
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.740]   that I've been focusing on is the social media aspect
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:49.500]   of how it's not just about the reality of deaths.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.780]   It's about the state of the collective intelligence
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.740]   of the human species, which is determined
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.300]   by our communication on social media.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:02.140]   So we can be collectively afraid.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:05.740]   The fear can spread, or it could be YOLO can spread,
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:09.980]   or it could be all different kinds of misinformation.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:12.580]   And of course, during the election year,
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.300]   the politics influences our perception
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.340]   of what is true and not.
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:21.660]   But having real, rigorous, nuanced conversation
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:25.460]   about this kind of stuff is the way out of this.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.580]   And that's where social media really comes in,
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.360]   because social media drives division,
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.660]   where people form tribes and so on.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:37.460]   And it feels like it's honestly a technology problem.
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.420]   People say it's a human problem,
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:42.420]   but it just feels like, I believe humans are good,
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.860]   and technology can enable them to be thoughtful.
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:49.540]   - We talked earlier about the magic of Silicon Valley
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.180]   and then maybe going too far
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.260]   with the Facebook groups example,
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:55.680]   where you take out all that friction.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.520]   What happened was, we used to have something called r/chron,
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.180]   reverse chronological order.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.060]   That's how you consumed a feed.
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.260]   So any kind of social feed, like Twitter,
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.700]   was in reverse chronological order.
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.780]   The newest thing was up top,
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.780]   and you would just work your way backwards.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.560]   And so it gave this really fresh feeling.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.820]   And then a guy named Dave Morin
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.580]   and the team over at Facebook realized,
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.460]   you know, there are some things
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:21.100]   that got a lot of attention two hours ago,
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.380]   and the stuff since then has not been as important.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.820]   But if you missed that, there was a really good tweet
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.620]   where there was a really good update.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:28.840]   Somebody had a baby.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.920]   Can we get the baby one at the top?
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.320]   And it was like, well, how would we do that?
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.680]   How would we know that that's the important one?
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.880]   It's like, well, let's put a like button on it,
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.360]   and let's see how many comments there are.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.800]   So if it gets a lot of likes or comments or retweets,
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.160]   let's show those first,
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.240]   and then we'll kind of mix in the most recent stuff.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.480]   And so when you're on Twitter,
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.800]   and then when Facebook did that,
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.640]   Facebook became so addicting,
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.000]   'cause Facebook was on,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.840]   what has got the most engagement, put that first,
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.400]   so every time you opened up Facebook,
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.020]   you get the dopamine hit.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:02.740]   And then what happens when you see the bar mitzvah photo
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:07.740]   or the enraging story about some injustice in the world?
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.940]   You retweet it, you write a comment,
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:11.900]   you share it on your wall.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.820]   And thus, this addiction to the outrageous,
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:18.860]   the outlandish, the inspiring occurred.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:20.860]   And it used to be like inspiring stuff,
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:23.020]   puppies or some heartwarming story.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.300]   And then it got dark.
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.020]   And then people started to realize,
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:30.180]   if I wanna show up on the top of my friends' feeds,
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.540]   if I say something controversial or I'm outraged,
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.020]   I get to the top.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.780]   And then that's when outrage culture came in.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.420]   And then that's when cancel culture came in.
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.740]   Everybody started to realize,
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:42.860]   if I try to cancel that person for being a racist
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.780]   or a sexist or a horrible human being
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.980]   or whatever they did that's wrong,
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.700]   I get to the top of the feed.
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:51.260]   And we all collectively started playing
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.820]   a very weird video game,
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:55.020]   which is how outraged can we all be?
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.620]   And to get to the top of the list.
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:59.100]   And then of course, with Trump, he realized it.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.140]   And he's like, "Okay, yeah,
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.900]   I'm just gonna make fun of a celebrity
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.500]   and I get more retweets.
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.060]   Okay, I'm gonna make fun of Rosie O'Donnell
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.580]   for being overweight or something."
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.700]   And he just starts attacking people.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.340]   And people are like, "Oh my God, what did he say?"
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.460]   And he copied that from Howard Stern.
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:13.420]   'Cause he was in New York
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.460]   and he used to be on Howard Stern.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.220]   And Howard Stern took over all the dialogue
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.620]   in the '80s and '90s because he was outrageous.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.660]   And then Trump did that.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.540]   And then social media incorporated that
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.780]   into the operating system.
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:26.580]   It became the actual device of social media.
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.740]   Was the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.980]   We've got something incredible for you.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.460]   Everybody salivates like Pavlov's dog.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.700]   Oh my God, I can be outraged.
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.220]   That's what's gotta be undone.
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.440]   And the only way for that to be undone
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.460]   is these things can't be billions of people
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.320]   where the most outrageous thing
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.460]   that happened in the world today,
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.240]   in the last five minutes, is now in front of you.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.700]   And that's why people have anxiety,
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.700]   they don't sleep, and they doom scroll all night.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.500]   It's because the human mind was not meant to process
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.860]   this much suffering, pain, anger.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:59.100]   And that's why we have all this mental health issues.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:02.580]   Also, young girls or even adults
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.140]   watching other people post their private jets
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:10.140]   and their vacations and YOLO adventures on their Instagram.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.760]   To the point at which young people are now faking
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.260]   being on private jets to put on their Instagram.
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:22.260]   And creating this crazy FOMO around their Instagrams.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.460]   We wonder why people are unhappy.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.060]   If you think everybody's on a private jet
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.260]   going to some Michelin star restaurant
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:32.180]   or whatever the coolest thing in the world is today,
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.460]   going to the Grammys, going to whatever,
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:38.340]   Coachella, Burning Man, you're like, "Oh, but I'm home.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:43.100]   "I'm in my house and I'm not at Burning Man."
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.620]   - Getting inadequate. - Exactly.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:47.020]   So this whole system is creating
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:48.300]   the wrong set of incentives.
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.580]   I tend to believe it's possible
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.860]   to still have extremely high engagement
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.660]   and create a successful, profitable business
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:58.460]   while encouraging personal growth.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.260]   Like encouraging people to be the best version of themselves.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:02.980]   I just think we haven't,
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:05.500]   we got the first generation of social networks.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.820]   I think a new generation needs to be built.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.380]   - Is that your plan for a business?
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.860]   - Well, I have a longer term plan
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.220]   in terms of ambition,
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:18.220]   which is I believe in being able to have
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:22.180]   deep connection between human and AI systems,
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.940]   like partners, friends.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:26.220]   There is a connection to there with social media.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:31.220]   I do think AI has a strong role to play
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.700]   in representing us, in guiding us,
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:37.340]   in how we consume social media.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:41.060]   So this algorithm that controls the feed for Facebook
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:43.980]   is a somewhat centralized algorithm.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:47.020]   But instead to give more power to the people,
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.140]   individuals to where each one of us have our own algorithm.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.980]   - Bring your own algorithm. - Bring your own algorithm.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.100]   - B-Y-O-A? - B-Y-O-A, I like it.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.780]   - Instead of bringing your own alcohol,
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.020]   bring your own algorithm.
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:58.300]   Well, I mean, if you thought about it,
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.340]   if we came and said, "I want,
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.080]   "when I look at my Twitter feed,
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.440]   "I would like to see the people
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.320]   "who are the most helpful in the world,
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.120]   "generous, kind, intelligent, considered,
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.040]   "commenting on things that I don't already know about
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.280]   "'cause I wanna open my worldview."
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.160]   That could be a beautiful thing for society.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.640]   And actually Jack was talking about,
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.980]   potentially on Twitter,
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.760]   letting people bring their own algorithms
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.520]   and sort their feeds themselves.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.360]   This would be a wonderful thing.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.340]   I think it's one of the reasons Clubhouse has resonated
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.620]   is it's such a diverse group of people
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.640]   that I've been able to drop in on conversations
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.720]   with people who are nothing like me.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.200]   And listen in and hear conversations
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.040]   that I wouldn't normally be privy to.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.260]   And everybody's like, "Oh, come join as a speaker.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:46.200]   "I wanna do a room with you."
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.720]   I get asked every day, "Can we do a room?
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:48.560]   "Can we do a room?"
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.720]   Ask an angel investor, talk about startups.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.700]   And I'm like, my usage of Clubhouse
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.840]   is going on my Peloton treadmill,
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.000]   putting Clubhouse on, picking a room, and just listening.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.540]   It's so delightful for me as a podcaster
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.560]   where my job is to talk, to sit back
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.160]   and just put in a couple of miles and play chess
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.040]   and listen to a Clubhouse discussion
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.040]   that is about relationships or some fashion or hip hop
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.600]   or whatever it is that I'm not part of.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.100]   I just sit there and I listen and you learn.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.360]   It's like such a delightful thing.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.560]   I always think about these kids who go to college
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.420]   and I've always been so jealous of these Ivy League kids.
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.960]   They go and they're like, "Oh, I gotta go to class."
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.200]   And I'm like, "I would just love to sit there
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:33.120]   "and listen to Professor Lex talk."
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.720]   What a privilege to sit there and let somebody else drive
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.240]   and talk and listen and learn.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.040]   - Yeah, that's the beauty of podcasting.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.440]   But of course, Clubhouse creates a whole nother experience
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.280]   where it's conversations, it's different.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.720]   - I think it's gonna be the in-between.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.040]   I like it as a, you release your podcast.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.080]   You and I are gonna release this podcast, right?
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.480]   And then at some point I'll have you on my pod
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.440]   when you launch your startup.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.640]   And then at some point somebody's gonna be like,
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.720]   you and I will run into, and I ran into you,
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.640]   I saw you were on Clubhouse the other night,
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.000]   and I was busy, but I was almost gonna click on you
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.280]   and say, "Let's start a room together."
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.520]   But you and I will start a room together
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.680]   with Eric Weinstein or somebody,
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.320]   or Sam Harris will jump in or Elon,
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.920]   and we'll have a different experience,
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.200]   which would just shoot the shit.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.820]   And it'll act as like a fabric and a little filler
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.880]   between the tentpole podcasts, right?
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.080]   Like you and Eric, you've done three, I think, with Eric?
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.200]   - Yeah, we did four, but I haven't released the fourth yet.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.420]   - Oh, okay, so I'm gonna watch all three
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.440]   'cause I really thought your U-Way
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.160]   and him giving you advice was very interesting dynamic.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.560]   I thought it was a very interesting dynamic.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560]   And I find him like a fascinating cat.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   We know everybody in common except we've never met.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.920]   It's very weird because you think about the social graph
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.240]   in the real world, this is why I think augmented reality
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.440]   is gonna be such an amazing product.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.240]   I just have one killer feature I want for augmented reality.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:57.000]   We wear our glasses, and when I look at you above your head,
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.440]   I see the relationships we have
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.840]   and the things we've done together, right?
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.160]   So I see, oh, you both know Sam Harris,
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.840]   or you had Elon on the podcast on this date,
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.840]   or you and I were both at Burning Man in 2016.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.760]   - So it's the most meaningful element
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.560]   of our connection in the network, yeah.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.920]   - And then, 'cause we would discover that through small talk,
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.800]   but imagine you're like at a party,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.800]   and you look, and it just, people glow.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.320]   And you just see a glow around a person,
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:27.040]   and green means you have some financial relationship,
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.000]   blue means you have some friendship one,
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.520]   or yellow means you have friendship one,
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.120]   blue means you know nothing about each other,
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.040]   you have no connections.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.960]   You're like, wow, these blue people I have no connection to.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.740]   These people, that one's glowing red,
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.000]   we know seven or more people in common,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.200]   and those are the seven people.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.200]   Oh, we should go talk about how we know each other.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.160]   That could, and that sort of happened with Facebook,
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.520]   remember, or MySpace, where you were like,
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.680]   oh, you know that person, friend of a friend?
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.560]   But that's what is gonna be AR's,
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.560]   this is why I think if Apple figures out AR,
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.960]   or Snapchat, and they just have those glasses,
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.840]   forget about VR, it's just nauseating and whatever,
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.520]   but AR, where you put the glasses on,
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.720]   you see the real world, but you augment it.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.720]   - You make, just like you were saying,
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.320]   you make it frictionless, a very low friction,
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.840]   to make a deep human connection,
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.080]   because you have all the basic elements there already.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.680]   - Now think about the unintended consequences
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.520]   of what I just described.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.760]   It could get creepy and weird.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.200]   - The privacy thing.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.920]   - I mean, people will, here's the thing.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.520]   People, your privacy is an illusion.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.600]   Like, all this information is there,
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.240]   and then people are more than willing
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.920]   to give up privacy in exchange for some value.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.600]   You know, it's a value trade.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:44.360]   And giving, if my Tesla, when I'm driving
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.600]   in the direction of my house, just starts the navigation
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.400]   and saves me three clicks, and that friction's gone,
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.720]   I'm willing to give Tesla my location
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.640]   and my home address, right?
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.000]   I'm not willing to give Zuckerberg anything,
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.960]   'cause I don't trust him, but you get the idea.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.200]   I mean, it will be that way with DNA and other things.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.120]   At some point, we'll just be like,
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.160]   yeah, just take my DNA.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.920]   Like, I don't, yeah, sure, people can look
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.040]   and see that I'm a mental midget,
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.360]   and my IQ's lower than, I don't wanna bring
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.640]   the bell curve up or whatever, but you could figure out,
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.840]   if we all put our DNA in a sequenced online,
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:17.120]   and be like, oh yeah, Lex has got 10 more IQ points
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.040]   than J. Cal, and Sam's got 10 more than Lex,
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.240]   and all of a sudden, people are like,
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.480]   all bedded out of shape about it,
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.280]   but what if we did that, and they were like,
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.200]   and by the way, you also, all three of you
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.400]   are gonna get Parkinson's, unless you do X, Y, and Z,
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.520]   unless you eat more blueberries,
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.840]   or whatever we figure out.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.440]   - They're going to accept it pretty quickly.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.240]   Yeah, that's-- - Brave new world.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.120]   - Brave new world.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.760]   I have to ask you, you're, Justin, you were saying
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:43.600]   you're one of the world experts in investing in--
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.400]   - In startups. - In startups.
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.940]   Yeah, VC and so on.
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.600]   From the perspective of the startup,
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:53.960]   I was always kind of skeptical of raising money.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:57.440]   It feels like people do it too quickly, too easily,
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:00.440]   but I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:04.560]   When is the, when should a startup raise money,
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.160]   and from the perspective of the investor,
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.120]   when should the investor invest in a startup?
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.080]   Like, is there a timing thing here?
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.520]   Is there a, what, yeah, what--
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.560]   - It's a very important question,
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.480]   because the venture capital community
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:24.040]   is only going to fund sub-1% of enterprise
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.080]   that started in the United States every year,
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.840]   like maybe 10 basis points of them, like one in 1,000.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.360]   And the reason is, it's jet fuel.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.080]   You only want to take that money
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:36.880]   if you really want to build something big,
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.400]   and you want to build it fast.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:42.040]   And when you put jet fuel behind a startup,
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.520]   as we've seen with other rockets,
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.880]   things can blow up, and people can die.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.240]   You know, it's not people literally dying,
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.300]   but the business can go up in smoke, right?
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.840]   Like, rockets get blown up all the time at SpaceX
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.120]   as part of their ambitious plans.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:57.200]   And startups, seven out of 10 startups we invest in,
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.580]   go to zero.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.120]   Now, if you were to start the business
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.880]   and only build it off customer revenue,
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.940]   and use your own money, and go nice and slow,
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:07.040]   and grow 10% a year, the chances of you
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.320]   blowing up the rocket are very low,
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.240]   because you're riding a bicycle.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.360]   Like, so, you can go a little faster,
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.520]   but the bicycle can only go so fast.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.240]   And once you start taking that money,
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.600]   the way venture capital is constructed
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:28.120]   in the mix of like MIT or Harvard's endowments is,
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:31.160]   you know, we're gonna put some money into safe things,
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.040]   and then we're gonna have these
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.760]   really binary things over here.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.360]   And they probably put 5% in venture capital traditionally.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.600]   It's grown to 20% just as a function
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.700]   of how successful it's been.
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.880]   So, you know, the Harvards of the world and MIT
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.020]   is probably want 5% or 10% in venture,
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.080]   but it's grown to 25% because, you know,
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.480]   companies like Airbnb and Uber
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.520]   have grown so big, and Tesla.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.640]   But the goal is, in these venture funds,
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.640]   we're gonna invest in 30 names,
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.000]   and one or two of them are gonna return
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.960]   three times the capital we've deployed.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.160]   So, it's a $300 million fund, and there's 30 names,
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.400]   and they each got 10 million.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.320]   That means one of the 10 million
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:11.080]   is gonna return the fund plus.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.480]   So, that means it has to grow 30x,
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.960]   and then 60x to double the fund.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.560]   And you're really supposed to be doing
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.920]   three times cash on cash.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.460]   So, that $300 million fund's expectation
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:25.020]   is in 10 years to return 900 million.
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:27.160]   Triple the person's money, as opposed to the stock market,
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.320]   which doubles your money in the same period.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.700]   So, you're supposed to do 25% annualized returns
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.480]   in order to triple the money.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.920]   And maybe have an outlying chance
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.040]   of four or five times the money,
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.800]   which does happen sometimes when you have an outlier
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.640]   in your portfolio like Uber or Facebook was.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.580]   And what that means is, the venture capitalist behavior
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.420]   in the game they're playing
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:48.920]   is different than you as the founder.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:51.560]   You as the founder, you may really care about this,
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.780]   and it dying really matters to you.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.160]   And then you got a venture capitalist who's like,
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.600]   we're betting on 30 names, we need two of them
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.640]   to hit it out of the park, maybe three.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.340]   And nothing else is meaningful.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:05.840]   So, now you start thinking about the game theory there.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.800]   You're dealing with money that is coming in
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.680]   that only cares about you going 100x.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.640]   - Yes.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:17.100]   - It's a whole different ballgame.
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.580]   Whereas, if you build off revenue,
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:19.420]   you don't have to do that.
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:20.860]   And if you look at a company like Calm.com,
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.080]   we invested at five million,
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.300]   the next round they did was 250.
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.240]   They were so capital efficient
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.880]   that they grew from $10,000 a month in revenue
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.200]   to millions of dollars a month in revenue
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.320]   over those four years since we invested,
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.860]   and they didn't raise money in between.
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:34.780]   - Wow.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.020]   - It was unbelievable.
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.820]   And I've only seen this happen three or four times.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.660]   - So, it doesn't happen,
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:41.020]   all this capital efficient meaning
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.580]   based on customer revenue alone
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:46.080]   plus some small amount of fundraising,
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.420]   you're able to grow.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.500]   How hard is it to do that?
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.500]   - It takes extreme product market fit.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.400]   You have to have a great price for your product
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.700]   that has a great margin.
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:59.280]   Yeah, and if you're doing something in hardware,
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:00.380]   it's probably impossible
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.660]   'cause it's super capital intensive.
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:03.780]   So, it's probably gotta be a software business.
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:05.740]   Hardware businesses take a lot more.
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:08.020]   - Do venture capitalists get in the way at all
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:08.860]   of the business?
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:11.000]   Or is it possible to get out of the way?
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.460]   - Yeah, if you get young venture capitalists
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:14.740]   who are starting their career,
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:16.620]   they're very nervous and scared
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.740]   because they're putting all these bets.
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:21.780]   And then there's a very weird thing that happens.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.820]   The bad news comes first.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.820]   So, companies that don't work out
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:28.620]   go out of business immediately.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:31.820]   So, if it's not gonna be Comm or Robinhood or Uber,
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:32.900]   those take seven,
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.300]   you know you have one of those great successes
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:38.480]   somewhere in your five, six, seven, eight as an investor.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.340]   What is the first five years like?
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:42.160]   The first five years you feel like an idiot
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.720]   'cause you, let's say you make these 10 bets.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:49.580]   In year two, two or three of them come back
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.740]   and they don't have product market fit
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:51.740]   and they're out of money.
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.740]   And they say, "Can we have more money?"
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.540]   And you say, "No, we have to go get it from somebody else
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:56.660]   'cause you have to prove that there's still a market for it.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.140]   We may keep our pro rata.
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:36:59.340]   We may put a little bit in
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:00.900]   to maintain our percentage ownership,
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.900]   but we're not going to give you another big chunk of money."
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.180]   And that company dies.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.740]   So, now you've got 10 million, poof, up in smoke.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.180]   Boom, 10 million up in smoke.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.740]   So, this is called the J curve
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:14.380]   where your performance goes down.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:16.380]   And then it's only in years four or five and six
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:17.220]   it starts going up.
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.180]   And what you're seeing right now
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.980]   is the people who started like I did in 2000,
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:23.460]   you know, just 11, 12 years ago in 2009,
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:24.600]   I started investing.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.300]   We all look like geniuses.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.380]   Why?
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:28.940]   We're at the end of the cycle.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.380]   We invested after when the stock market was on the floor
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:34.020]   after the financial crisis.
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.700]   And it's gone straight up since.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:36.540]   So, everybody look,
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:37.440]   there's a couple of little blips in there,
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.540]   but generally speaking,
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.380]   there hasn't been like a major crash
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:41.540]   with the exception of the pandemic crash,
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.780]   but that bounced right back.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:45.300]   And so, you know, it takes a decade
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:47.340]   to figure out if you're good at it.
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.740]   And then if the market crashes again,
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:50.860]   everybody feels like it again, the cycle starts again.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.780]   So, you are now, as a founder,
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:56.820]   you are now inserting yourself into that casino.
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:58.500]   And now you've got all these other forces
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.860]   pushing and pulling.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:00.860]   And you're growing,
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:03.180]   let's say your company was growing 50%.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:04.420]   You feel like, "Wow, I'm successful.
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.580]   I made a million dollars last year
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:07.380]   and now I'm doing a million and a half."
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.300]   And the first thing a VC is gonna say to you
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:10.260]   is, "How do we triple?
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.100]   We're growing too slow."
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:14.140]   - See, but that's like you said that beautifully,
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.380]   is a rocket fuel.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.980]   It's, in a sense, it's a kind of motivation.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:19.820]   It's a drive.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:20.980]   I mean, it's a positive.
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.020]   - So, if you want that.
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.660]   - Yes, if you want that.
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:24.540]   - If you want that,
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:27.060]   if you wanna go to Navy SEAL school,
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.060]   you're gonna be in pain
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:29.780]   and they're gonna put that hose in your face
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:30.900]   while you're underwater
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.700]   with your hands tied behind your back in the pool
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:33.980]   and you're gonna be choking
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.540]   and they may have to do CPR on you.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:37.020]   And like every couple of years,
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:40.220]   tragically, somebody dies in Navy SEAL school.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.060]   - Yeah, well-
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:42.620]   - Does it mean we're getting rid of the Navy SEALs?
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:43.900]   - Brock, if he dies, he dies.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.460]   I don't know if you know who David Goggins is
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.300]   by any chance.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.140]   - I do.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.780]   I mean, I don't know him personally, but oh my Lord.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:52.220]   - So, I'm running 48 miles together with him in person
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.060]   in a month.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:53.900]   - What?
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.380]   You're doing an ultra marathon?
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.500]   - With him and probably other stuff
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.860]   because he enjoys just breaking people and making them cry.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:03.180]   - Oh my God, I'm so jelly.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.140]   - So, no, I, well, I offered,
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:08.260]   we agreed a while ago to do a podcast
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.980]   and he's like, "Oh yeah, come, we'll do it this day."
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:13.100]   - Is he in the Bay Area?
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:14.340]   - I don't know where the hell he is,
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.020]   but we're doing it in,
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.620]   I don't think I'm supposed to say where it is,
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.500]   but it's not anywhere close to anywhere of this.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.220]   It's in the middle of nowhere.
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:24.220]   But he seems to be in a bunch of different locations.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:27.260]   Like he's in Oregon or something like that.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.260]   - What does he do for,
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.020]   outside of writing books and being inspirational,
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:31.900]   does he actually train people or like-
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:33.860]   - No, he's just,
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:35.620]   he's a full-time insane.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:40.460]   Like he fights forest fires like for a few months a year
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.900]   as a fireman, like unpaid labor.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:43.740]   Like he, you know,
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:46.140]   there's a bunch of people who are like him,
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.700]   like Navy SEALs and so on,
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:50.420]   that kind of make a career out of motivational speaking,
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:51.260]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:53.100]   He's not interested in any of that.
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:57.940]   He's literally interested in just doing hard shit
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:59.060]   all the time.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.060]   - Breaking himself.
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:00.900]   - Breaking himself personally.
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.160]   - He seems like he wants to break himself.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.900]   And that book is amazing.
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:06.340]   And the audio book's amazing
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.180]   when he's talking about how fat he was
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.860]   and how he just had to go and keep running
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:14.380]   and his legs are broken and he's just in super pain
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:15.220]   and he just goes through it.
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:16.540]   It's really inspiring.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:17.380]   - The inspiring thing also-
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.300]   - Are you gonna videotape yourself doing this?
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.580]   I can't wait to see you get destroyed.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.420]   - Yeah, well, you guys-
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:26.900]   - This is gonna be so entertaining for the Lex audience.
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:28.340]   - The pain.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:32.220]   But the other inspiring thing is he's happily married
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:34.260]   and there's a partnership there that's,
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:38.020]   everybody finds this attention as a push and pull
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:40.260]   that's beautiful, I think.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.140]   But in speaking of beautiful push and pull,
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.980]   how about that transition?
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:47.420]   - Yeah, here we go.
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:50.900]   - You and Chamath, he's a friend of yours.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:51.740]   - Bestie.
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:52.740]   - Besties, yeah.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:53.580]   - Yeah, good friend.
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.420]   I mean, there's very few people in my life,
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:58.920]   him, Elon, David Sacks, John Brockmans,
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.180]   very few people have supported me as much as those folks.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.460]   I mean, I'm a huge debt.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.660]   - So he's also co-host on the All In podcast.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:07.420]   - We taped episode 21 today.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:08.260]   - Oh, today, cool.
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.400]   - Yeah, every Friday now, they wanna do every Friday.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.060]   They're addicted like me and you are to podcasts.
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.240]   - So you're going to release it when?
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.260]   - It's probably released as we're sitting here.
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.500]   - Oh, okay, beautiful.
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:18.340]   I can't wait.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.160]   - Special guest on it.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.020]   We had Draymond Green from the Warriors phone in.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.180]   So we had our first guest.
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:24.020]   - Awesome.
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.260]   - Yeah, so it's really funny 'cause he plays poker with us
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:28.100]   and we're all besties, so yeah.
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:32.140]   - Beautiful, so you guys went pretty heated
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:34.900]   against each other on Robinhood.
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:35.740]   - Yes.
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.540]   - There's two things I wanna ask.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:41.020]   First, on the actual Robinhood discussion
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:42.860]   and the Wall Street Best discussion,
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:44.340]   can you steel man his argument?
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.340]   What was the nature of the disagreement?
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:51.340]   'Cause I don't think it's as big as a space
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.940]   as it came off as sounding.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:55.420]   What is the nature of the disagreement?
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:42:00.420]   - He felt that Robinhood turned off trading
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:04.240]   because the hedge funds told them to
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.180]   and that they were bowing down
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.420]   to the pressure of the hedge funds.
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.980]   That's not true, but in a vacuum of information,
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.560]   you know what happens to people's minds,
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.060]   conspiracy theories abound
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.940]   and sometimes there is a conspiracy theory
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:21.100]   and sometimes there's just the appearance of impropriety
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:24.120]   or a bunch of related things.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.940]   Like when you look at the Trump situation with Russia,
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.940]   was Trump trying to coordinate with Russia
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:32.700]   or were the Russians just screwing with a bunch
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:37.700]   of neophyte, idiotic dipshits like Donald Trump Jr.
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.060]   who don't know any better?
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:40.640]   And they don't know that you shouldn't meet
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.820]   with the Russians and if you do meet with the Russians,
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:45.220]   you are probably a useful idiot.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:47.140]   You probably should tell the FBI.
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:49.780]   They're just a bunch of idiots in all likelihood, who knows?
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.300]   - And it's a vacuum of information.
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:52.980]   - And it's a vacuum of information, we don't know.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:55.160]   And the Russians are trying to compromise everybody.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.640]   So would you call it a conspiracy
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.200]   or would you call it an attempted conspiracy?
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.360]   There was no conspiracy here.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:07.260]   What it was was Robinhood needed to raise billions
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.360]   of dollars to say solvent in all likelihood
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.320]   and they weren't allowed to talk about it.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.880]   So they were forced into not talking about it
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.600]   in all likelihood and had to come up
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.120]   with that money or shut down.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.600]   And then what got me upset with Chamath
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.320]   and we had a talk afterwards that people don't know about.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.260]   I'll talk about it here for the first time.
[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:30.960]   On Sunday, we had to have a little, we had to air it out.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.120]   - Yeah, in the episode after,
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.360]   you guys sound like you've had a private, you've made up.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.560]   - We had a private discussion, just one-on-one.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.680]   And we said, listen, we love each other, we're besties.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:41.340]   We've always been there for each other.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.720]   What happened here?
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:46.240]   And what happened there is I'm fiercely loyal to my folks,
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:50.200]   whether it's Chamath or Travis from Uber or Sachs or whoever.
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.400]   I'm just a loyal guy.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.240]   - Yes.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:54.160]   - And I'm always ride or die with my founders.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.120]   If I invest in them, even if they make a mistake,
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.360]   and Uber made plenty of mistakes,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.000]   I always went on CNBC, on my podcast and said,
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.560]   hey, we're gonna fix these things.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.360]   I'm in touch with the team.
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.160]   Mistakes were made, we're gonna solve them.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.280]   This is a group of people with great intent
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.440]   who want to make the world a better place.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.280]   And you know what?
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.360]   I was hated for a period of time with Uber.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.520]   I was hated for it last week with Robinhood.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.440]   I got a lot of blowback.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.720]   But I think in both of those cases, eventually I was right.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.200]   Uber's doing great stuff in the world.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.920]   Robinhood's doing great stuff in the world.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:27.680]   And I like to be loyal to my investments and my partners.
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:30.120]   I feel like if you invest and you're on the team,
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.560]   you have really three choices.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.520]   You can either fight for your team, you can go silent,
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:37.080]   or you can throw your team under the bus.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.120]   And I've watched investors throw the team
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.040]   that they invested in that made them a bunch of money
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.840]   under the bus, not acceptable to me.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.400]   And being quiet's not acceptable to me.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.200]   So I always ask the founder, do you want me to,
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.520]   is it okay if I go out and defend you publicly?
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:49.920]   If they say yes, I do it.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:51.080]   - That's beautiful, by the way,
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:53.680]   'cause what else do we have in this world if not friendship?
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:54.600]   - Loyalty means everything to me.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:57.100]   I grew up in Brooklyn where if you were not loyal,
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:00.840]   and you were not loyal to your crew,
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.600]   then you were a ronin.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.840]   You were out there on your own, flailing in the,
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:09.640]   trust me, you do not wanna be on your own
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:12.260]   in 1970s, '80s Brooklyn, Manhattan.
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:13.360]   You need to have a crew with you.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.760]   I've gotten into, you don't wanna get into a fight
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.240]   with 10 guys and be alone or just be with,
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.920]   you need a crew to survive.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:23.840]   So I just learned early, and my dad, who owned a bar,
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.440]   just drilled into me being loyal.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.120]   And so for whatever reason, I'm a bulldog
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.240]   when it comes to loyalty.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.280]   And Chamath came out and said,
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.240]   these guys need to go to jail, and they're scumbags,
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.080]   and da-da-da.
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.560]   And I'm trying to defend them,
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.680]   and I'm in a position where I can't defend them
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.240]   because I don't have complete information.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.440]   There is no complete information,
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:40.760]   and it's in the heat of the moment,
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.320]   and then it becomes the number one story.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.120]   And it's my number three investment.
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:48.220]   And Chamath has a competing company, SoFi.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:50.980]   And he's killing my guys.
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:53.140]   And then I started killing his guys.
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:54.940]   And then all of a sudden, we're like, wait a second,
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:59.620]   we're best friends, and we're swinging our swords
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:02.540]   at each other, and we're a group of the seven samurai
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.740]   who fight together.
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:06.580]   When did we turn on each other?
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:08.020]   And then everybody else who's on the pod,
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:09.540]   the two Davids, who, you know,
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:10.780]   are both on the spectrum a bit.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.020]   They got a little Asperger's or whatever.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:13.860]   No offense, Lex.
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.220]   (laughing)
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.060]   - Untaken.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:16.880]   - Untaken.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.720]   I'm not saying, you know.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:22.460]   There is a, you're into AI, and you might be somewhere.
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.740]   - It's not a coincidence, yeah.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:24.580]   - Might not be a coincidence.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.180]   Anyway, we upgraded the two Davids' firmware.
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.620]   We're gonna upgrade your firmware after this.
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:30.700]   I'll give you, yeah, you're on the 1.5.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.060]   You have the three emotions now.
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:32.900]   Or should we add a fourth?
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:34.060]   Do you wanna go with joy?
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:35.340]   - I'm on the 2.0 already.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:36.660]   - You're on the 2.0, you got the joy.
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:38.620]   Oh, my God, how's it working out in the joy chip?
[01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:39.460]   - It's difficult.
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.060]   - It's difficult, you'll get there.
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:42.180]   Just let it happen, Lex.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.940]   Just let the joy happen.
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.220]   So anyway, we just talked about it offline,
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:49.220]   and we decided, like, listen,
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:52.020]   we didn't pre-game that episode,
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.860]   and I happened to be skiing with my family.
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:55.500]   I had taken the first vacation
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.540]   since this goddamn pandemic started,
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:58.820]   and I was having a wonderful time,
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:46:59.900]   and then this whole thing blows up.
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.820]   I'm coming off the mountain,
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:04.020]   just having a great time with my daughter skiing,
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:06.100]   and then I'm mixing it up with him,
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.940]   and he had a short fuse about it,
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:09.300]   'cause he was triggered, he told me,
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:13.780]   because he really feels like he's fighting to defend
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:15.060]   the everyman, and I was like,
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.460]   that's what my team's doing.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:19.140]   That's why they named the company Robin Hood.
[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:21.340]   We're on the same side here.
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:22.180]   And then over time,
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.660]   we've started to see the explanation come out,
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:28.100]   and people who are friends are gonna have disagreements.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.540]   In the podcast, it happened to happen very publicly,
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:32.040]   and we didn't know it was gonna become
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:35.180]   the number one story in the world.
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:36.940]   If Trump still had his Twitter handle,
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:39.180]   this would not have been a story.
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:41.500]   Trump would have said something about GameStop,
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:44.180]   and he would have co-opted the entire conversation.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:47.580]   So in a way, going back to our censorship discussion,
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:51.140]   I might actually be in favor of Trump being censored,
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:54.020]   only because, only because,
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:57.260]   how delightful has it been since January 20th
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:00.300]   that we can all focus on something other than him?
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:03.220]   He was exhausting.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:06.580]   I mean, the amount of cycles he took on our processors.
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.900]   - He monopolized the conversation.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:11.980]   And now this is a little bit more of a distributed,
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:13.060]   like this bunch of-- - Yeah, everybody gets
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:14.900]   a chance to be the number one news story.
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:17.340]   Everybody gets a chance to discuss it, but--
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.740]   - So on a scale of one to 10, how much do you love Chamath?
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.180]   - Oh, 11, I mean, I love Chamath.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:24.780]   I mean, we played cards last night.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:27.900]   We're besties, and I would literally jump
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:29.580]   in front of a bullet for him.
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:31.140]   - I mean, what's the lesson in that discussion?
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:32.900]   'Cause it was super, I wouldn't,
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:34.340]   I think the love was felt,
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:35.580]   and the respect was felt throughout,
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:38.740]   even when you guys were going pretty vicious on each other.
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:40.100]   Is there a lesson to be learned?
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.980]   Do you regret any of that conversation?
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:44.420]   - No, I mean, I think he told me
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.740]   that he regretted some of the things he said.
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:47.020]   He said publicly on the podcast,
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.020]   like, "Listen, I was a little hot.
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:50.860]   I may have said things in the heat of the moment."
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.580]   But I don't live with too much regret,
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:54.220]   'cause I always think about intent.
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:56.300]   And it's one of the, nuance and intent
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:58.260]   have been totally lost.
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.140]   The idea that we could have any kind
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:01.860]   of a nuanced discussion about things
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:04.260]   seems to have been forgotten.
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:07.500]   And the fact that people don't look at people's intent,
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.900]   if you hurt somebody's feelings,
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:11.180]   or you disrespect somebody,
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:14.540]   or you do something mean or whatever,
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:15.940]   I always look at the intent.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:19.140]   And I've had people attack me,
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:21.620]   and I look at the intent, and I'm like,
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:23.260]   "That person feels bad about themselves."
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:25.780]   Or maybe I said something, and I insulted them,
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:27.340]   and that's why their blowback's there.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:29.300]   So I always try to think, what's the intent of the person?
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:32.300]   And then almost universally, you talk to somebody,
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:36.220]   and you find out you ascribe some crazy intent
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:37.260]   that's not there.
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:38.540]   And they're like, "Oh yeah, you know what happened?
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:39.820]   "I got in a fight with my spouse,
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:41.460]   "and I didn't sleep last night,
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:44.020]   "and I've had a lot of anxiety about my business,
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:47.500]   "and I just snapped and said something about you."
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:48.580]   And it's like, "Oh, okay."
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:52.580]   Like I literally had somebody on Twitter this past summer,
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:53.740]   I had said something.
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.780]   I was complaining about a New York Times journalist,
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:49:58.780]   and something I thought was wrong.
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.940]   And this person was a fan of that journalist.
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:02.820]   And they went, I kid you not,
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:04.380]   onto my social media account,
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:06.340]   found a picture I'd taken about
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:07.900]   how blue the sky was one day.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:11.620]   They reverse image searched the tree line,
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:15.020]   found the tree line on Google image search,
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:16.220]   somehow with a reverse image search,
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:20.580]   found an old listing that some broker had listed
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:23.060]   on their website of my house,
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:26.140]   and then posted my home address, the value of my home,
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:31.140]   and doxed me on Twitter.
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:33.660]   And I'm like, "What is going on here?"
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:37.020]   So I call the person, and I look them up,
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:40.260]   and they work in private equity in Boston.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:42.700]   And I look, and I'm like, "This person works in Boston,
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.500]   "this is July 4th week."
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:47.460]   So, and I, when I look at the person's LinkedIn,
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:49.500]   we have seven people in common.
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.540]   So going back to the AR conversation a while ago,
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:53.780]   I'm like, "Okay, this person literally just doxed me.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.900]   "I asked them to take it down.
[01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:57.380]   "They told me they won't take it down."
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:51:01.500]   And then I look, so then I DM him back on Twitter.
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:04.460]   And I said, "By the way, your boss, Susan,
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:07.100]   "and I know seven people in common."
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:09.820]   And these are the seven people, here's a screenshot.
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:12.500]   "What is she going to think when I call her on Monday,
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.500]   "and you've doxed me?
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:15.900]   "Here's my phone number if you'd like to talk."
[01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.420]   He calls me.
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.500]   I said, "What's going on?
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.460]   "Why would you do this?"
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.660]   He's like, "Well, I really pissed off
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:21.860]   "about what you said about this person."
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.620]   I was like, "You understand I've had like two
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:25.920]   "or three stalkers, like, and anybody who's high profile
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.940]   "like I am, like, or medium profile,
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:29.420]   "you're gonna have weird things happen.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:30.580]   "You literally put my home address,
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:32.320]   "you put my family at risk.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.300]   "What if I put your home address?
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:36.420]   "On my, I have 400,000 followers,
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:39.040]   "or 300,000 followers, you have like 300.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.940]   "What if I post your address?"
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:42.300]   He's like, "Well, I wish you wouldn't do that."
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.180]   I was like, "Well, I asked you kindly
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.820]   "to take my address down."
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:46.600]   And I said, "Are you married?"
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:50.140]   I said, "How old are you, like 25 or something?"
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:51.860]   He's like, "No, I'm 42."
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:53.220]   I was like, "You're 42 years old."
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:54.060]   I was like, "Are you married?
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:54.900]   "Do you have kids?"
[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.260]   He's like, "Yeah, I just had a baby like six months ago."
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:58.080]   I'm like, "You're home with your wife.
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.540]   "It's July 4th weekend.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:01.220]   "You're doxing Jason Calaganes
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.060]   "because you're upset at me
[01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:05.860]   "because I said something about a New York Times writer."
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:08.140]   He's like, "Yeah, this is the biggest mistake of my life."
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:12.180]   I said, "I tell you what, let's forget it ever happened."
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:13.580]   And he wrote me back.
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:14.620]   And he said, "I just wanted to thank you
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:15.900]   "for how you handled it.
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.220]   "My wife said I'm a complete fucking moron."
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:22.540]   And he literally sent me an email.
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:24.220]   My wife says I'm a complete fucking moron
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.660]   and I'm really sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:27.480]   And I wrote her back.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.700]   I said, I wrote her back and I said,
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.480]   "My wife says the same thing to me all the time.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.860]   "She says, 'Welcome to the club.'
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:32.980]   "It's totally fine."
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:33.820]   - But see, this--
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:36.540]   - But intent, nuance, it matters, right?
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:37.980]   And the person could be having a bad day
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:39.460]   and they do something stupid they regret.
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.460]   And what am I gonna do, cancel the guy?
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.620]   Or if I had called his boss,
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:45.380]   he would have been fired immediately.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:47.860]   And then I gotta live with this guy got fired
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.980]   and he's got a kid.
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.580]   And what is this personal destruction?
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:52.980]   Why are we doing this to each other?
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:54.800]   Life's hard enough.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.060]   Life's hard, right?
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:57.780]   Like just getting through the day is hard.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:00.540]   - Yeah, and that little bit of empathy,
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.740]   thinking about the intent of the person
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:04.780]   allows you to then sort of deescalate
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:05.900]   this kind of conversation
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:08.340]   that social media wants to escalate.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:09.180]   - Yes.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.000]   - So social media wants to escalate.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:10.840]   - Back to what we were saying.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:14.020]   If this, in my younger years,
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.180]   I would have retweeted the guy's home address
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:18.100]   and my address and would have called his boss
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:19.380]   and tried to get him fired or whatever.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:21.280]   And it's like, now I'm just like,
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:23.580]   what, why are we attacking each other?
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:24.540]   Life is so hard.
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:25.580]   I mean, this is what the pandemic,
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:27.620]   I think we should make everybody realize is like,
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:29.840]   look at how hard it is.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:30.680]   Life is hard.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.580]   And then just think about all the people suffering right now
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.860]   who are at home, the single mom or dad
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:38.640]   with two or three kids at home in public school.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.860]   Maybe they've been laid off and their kids aren't learning
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:44.140]   and they're in a tiny apartment.
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:46.740]   I mean, this has been brutal for a lot of people,
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.540]   not to mention people losing loved ones
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:49.980]   or maybe some people got corona
[01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:52.220]   and now their lungs are still not right.
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:53.500]   - Can I ask you about love?
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:54.340]   - Oh, sure.
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:58.580]   - I'm feeling it, you know, like we're an hour or two here,
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:53:59.420]   Lex.
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.260]   - Yeah, you feel you're getting it.
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:01.580]   - We could become besties.
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:02.420]   - We're good.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:05.100]   - I feel like we got a bromance going here, Lex.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:05.940]   - I feel it too.
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.280]   - I don't know if it's Eric Weinstein level,
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.860]   but I feel like it's close.
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:11.420]   - Yeah, I'm feeling the love.
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:13.220]   But you, we talked about the,
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.060]   - Yeah.
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.500]   - There's music to my ears,
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:21.380]   your whole rant on the Olympic nature of a startup.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:22.220]   - Yeah.
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:25.220]   - Is there a role,
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:29.060]   like what role does love, family, friendship
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:34.060]   play in that brutal pursuit of excellence?
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:37.060]   That is building a startup, building a company
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:40.540]   or building any, creating anything new in this world?
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.400]   - Such a great question and totally unprepared for it.
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.900]   'Cause I know nobody would ever ask me about that.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:49.460]   So I think it's why you've got quite a following
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:52.940]   on your podcast is that you're able to ask these questions.
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:56.700]   And I can tell one story because,
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:57.660]   I don't talk about,
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:00.700]   I try not to talk about relationship with Elon that often
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:03.660]   because he's so famous now.
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:06.460]   I mean, when we met, I used to go out to parties with him
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:07.780]   and people were like, "Oh my God, you're Jason Kalka?"
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:08.620]   I was like, "Yeah."
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:09.440]   And like, "Who's your friend?"
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.280]   I'm like, "That's my friend, Elon."
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:11.920]   And they'd be like, "What, he's doing rocket ships?"
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.380]   But he's told this story publicly, so I can tell it.
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:15.620]   I would never talk about anything
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:17.140]   that he hasn't already talked about publicly,
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:18.460]   especially since he's so high profile,
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:20.020]   but it was pretty funny moment.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:23.060]   He, there was a moment in time
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.380]   when Tesla almost went out of business
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.960]   and you've probably heard the story many times,
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.740]   but it was during the financial crisis
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:32.220]   and they were running out of money.
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:36.780]   And I said, "Let's go get a steak."
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:38.420]   And we're in LA, we drove to BOA
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.340]   and I had my orange Tesla Roadster
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:43.700]   and he had his P1 or P2, like the red one
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.820]   that I think is in space now.
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:48.620]   And we drove to the valet and we had a steak together
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:49.840]   and we're sitting there.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:52.900]   And I said, I read the story in Gawker or whatever,
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:56.640]   in New York Times, you only got like five weeks
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:58.420]   of money left in Tesla.
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.260]   He goes, "It's not true."
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:01.020]   I was like, "Oh, thank God."
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.100]   And he goes, "We have two weeks."
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:02.940]   (both laughing)
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.820]   I was like, "Oh God."
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.420]   I was like, "Well, what's going on
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.820]   with the rocket ship company?"
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:08.660]   - Yeah.
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:12.100]   - You know, like, I know you did the one last month
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.340]   and don't you have one coming up?
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.820]   He's like, "Yeah, we've got the third one coming up."
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.380]   I was like, "Well, how's that going?"
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:17.940]   He said, "Well, we blow that one up.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.620]   There's no more SpaceX."
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:22.340]   I was like, "So two weeks of money left in Tesla
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:24.260]   and SpaceX, you blew up the first two rockets,
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.700]   you blow up the third, SpaceX is over."
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:26.620]   He's like, "Yeah."
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:29.460]   I was like, "I can load you a couple million dollars.
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.580]   I don't have like a ton."
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:32.420]   He's like, "It's okay.
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:35.740]   Our friend, beep, has loaned me some money."
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:37.740]   And Elon's been super public about this.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:39.380]   I would never tell the story unless he hadn't been,
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:42.280]   but he was talking, he never said who it was,
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.100]   but somebody had loaned him money to keep him afloat.
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:47.140]   He was functionally bankrupt.
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:48.600]   I mean, he had the equity in the companies,
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.460]   but the equity was quickly becoming worth zero
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:51.420]   and the financial crisis.
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:54.460]   And he's figuring out if he's gonna go on vacation
[01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:55.520]   for Christmas or not.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:00.520]   And he's on the phone trying to save both companies.
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:04.060]   And I said, "Certainly there must be some good news."
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:07.180]   And he takes out his BlackBerry to date this conversation.
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.240]   There are no iPhones.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.760]   Takes his BlackBerry and he starts swiping.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:12.860]   And he says, "Don't tell anybody.
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:14.020]   This is what I'm building."
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:15.880]   And he shows me the Model S.
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:19.840]   And nobody knew that he was working on the Model S.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:22.080]   We knew he was doing the Roadster
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.200]   and he was trying to save the company.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:26.900]   And I looked at it and I was like, "That's gorgeous."
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:29.240]   It was the clay models.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.740]   So it was a full-size clay model.
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:33.080]   So there's human being standing around a clay version
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:34.360]   of this tiny little BlackBerry picture.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.880]   I'm scrolling through on the,
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.640]   remember that little pad or the ball on the BlackBerry?
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.480]   I'm scrolling through it.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.440]   I'm like, "This is fucking great."
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:43.040]   And I just said to him, I was like,
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.840]   "What's the range gonna be?"
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.480]   He says, "Well, I think we get 250 miles."
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.040]   I was like, "250 miles?"
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.880]   He's like, "Yeah, I think it'd be the safest car ever."
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:51.240]   I said, "What is it gonna cost?"
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.840]   He says, "I think this could cost eventually $50,000, $60,000."
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:57.680]   I said, "Elon, if you make that car,
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.240]   you'll change the goddamn world.
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:03.140]   You have to, this company must survive
[01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:06.960]   because the Roadster's for like 2,000 people
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.840]   in the United States.
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.000]   This car is for every person in the United States.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.840]   Every single person in the United States
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:15.120]   will want this car if it's $50,000."
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.240]   And maybe some of the people who have 20 or 30,000 cars
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:20.640]   won't be able to afford it, but they'll all want it.
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:21.880]   It's gorgeous.
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:22.920]   And he said, "You really think so?"
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:23.960]   I said, "Yeah."
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:26.000]   So I got home and I talked to my wife, Jade,
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.700]   and I said, "Do you have the checkbook?"
[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.240]   She does all the finances and stuff like that,
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:30.560]   pays every the bills and whatever.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:33.680]   And I said, "Don't tell anybody,
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.160]   Elon's making this great car."
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:38.040]   And I wrote two checks for $50,000.
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:40.000]   And I just took out a piece of paper and I wrote,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.720]   "E, love the new car.
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:45.720]   I'll take two."
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:48.280]   And I signed it.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:51.200]   I kissed the two $50,000 checks, put them in the envelope,
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.960]   and I FedExed it to him for Monday delivery.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.240]   And I said to Jade,
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:59.600]   "That $100,000 is going to be gone in 48 hours
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:02.120]   'cause it'll pay for one or two days of payroll on Tesla."
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.160]   So we just added like, instead of two weeks of roadway,
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.800]   he's got 12 days.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:09.680]   And the checks don't cash,
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.000]   but then I read a story that he's closed the money,
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.680]   saved the company in like the next week or two.
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:19.240]   And a couple of months later, the checks get cashed.
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:20.920]   And I'm like, "Okay."
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.800]   Three years later, I get an email.
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:25.040]   "Your reservation number," it's from Tesla,
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.680]   "Your reservation number is 0000001."
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:31.560]   And then five seconds later,
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:35.120]   "Your reservation number is 00073."
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.720]   And I forwarded the number one to Elon.
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:40.640]   I said, "You know, I can't take number one,
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.560]   signature number one, I can't take that.
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:43.840]   That's yours."
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:45.280]   And he's like, "Oh, I got five of them.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.240]   And besides, you're the first person who ordered it."
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.080]   And I was the first person who had seen it.
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.960]   - He's gonna get me to be teary-eyed.
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.400]   I mean, that's beautiful. - No, it was a very-
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:53.480]   - That's a beautiful moment.
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.080]   - It was an incredible moment for both of us.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:58.200]   And we talk about it sometimes, those moments in time.
[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.040]   And to your point about love, Elon-
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.240]   - That's like the darkest moment,
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:03.440]   one of the darkest moments in his life, probably.
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.920]   - I think it was, I can tell you,
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:07.200]   it was the darkest period of his life, for sure.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.840]   And he's been very public about how dark that was.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:12.520]   And I think, this is why I have great sympathy
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.880]   for the entrepreneurs of the world,
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:15.520]   like the suffering and the pain.
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.520]   And when he talks about the suffering and the pain,
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:18.840]   that all of these founders have felt,
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:20.400]   and then we're throwing rocks at them,
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:22.520]   and we're criticizing them as they try to change the world
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:23.360]   and save humanity.
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.520]   And in Tesla's case, I mean, they weren't,
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:28.520]   they weren't like delivering pizza.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:31.400]   I mean, they were trying to get us off of fossil fuels.
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:33.120]   Like this was a big, heady mission
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:36.760]   to literally save the environment, the planet, humanity.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:40.200]   And the way they shorted that stock and they attacked him,
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:44.440]   it was always perplexing to me why any human being
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:47.320]   who is standing on God's green earth
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:50.200]   would want to throw rocks at the guy
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:53.960]   who is trying to stem the dam of global warming
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:56.680]   that is about to engulf all of us.
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:00.120]   How dare they throw rocks at that guy?
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.140]   There's so many people you could throw rocks at.
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:05.200]   There's somebody who's making the Juul vaporizer.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:07.920]   Throw rocks at that scumbag, no offense.
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:09.800]   But like whoever's making the Juul things,
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.840]   and is selling pina colada flavor to 12 year olds,
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.140]   like throw rocks at them.
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:19.000]   Somebody's doing something abhorrent, but not E.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000]   I mean, and yeah, anyway, that car is up the road here,
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.760]   sitting under a cover with 20,000 miles on it in my garage.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:32.640]   And then the Roadster number 16 is in the garage next to it.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:34.520]   And every day I walk by the two of them
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:35.960]   and I get a warm feeling in my heart
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:39.080]   'cause I know E did it against all odds,
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:43.120]   against all odds, he pulled it off.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.680]   And it was that moment, that month in that,
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.480]   it was probably December, January,
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.920]   it's December of 2008, I think.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:52.960]   It was just 12 years ago,
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:55.320]   when you think about 13 years ago, it was dark.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:56.280]   I mean, it was dark.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:58.720]   And they almost had the same thing happen
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:01.240]   when the Model 3 production in June of two years,
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:02.320]   three years ago.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:05.320]   And I remember him just trying to get the Model 3
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:07.680]   out the door and the company almost crashed then.
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:10.640]   Most of these companies have these kinds of moments.
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:14.840]   And I think friendship is you get what you give,
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:16.560]   you get what you give.
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.880]   And if you are there for people,
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.320]   you're gonna feel so good about having done that.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:27.280]   And then the reciprocation effect,
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.400]   which you'd probably know very well,
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:30.600]   is so great in the world
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:33.240]   that anytime you're kind to people,
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:34.520]   you build this incredible bond.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:37.080]   And then what are we at the end of the day, Lex,
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:41.240]   besides a series of memories with the people we love?
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.240]   That's all it is.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:45.600]   It's just a series of memories and moments.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:47.440]   It's just moments.
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:48.760]   You ever see "Blade Runner"?
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:49.680]   - Yes, of course.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:52.160]   - Do you remember what Rucker Harris says at the end,
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.040]   "All of these memories gone like tears in the rain"?
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.880]   I mean, that's our existence.
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:59.360]   It just all goes away at some point.
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:01.080]   It's just these drops of rain.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.400]   Each of those memories,
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:05.280]   just like one snowflake or one drop of rain,
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.560]   and they're all lost at some point,
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.320]   but they're here now.
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:10.480]   And that's why we have to be there for each other.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:12.760]   That's why I feel like what I do
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.840]   is so important in this world,
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:16.320]   and I get such great meaning out of it.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:19.000]   Just being a friend, just having these conversations.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.360]   What you're doing on your podcast,
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:23.320]   just talking to intelligent people
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:25.880]   and spreading the word and the disciple,
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:28.600]   the gospel of what they're saying and amplifying it,
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.920]   you're inspiring so many people.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.760]   Every podcast, you get 500,000 people,
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.600]   a million people watch these videos,
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.720]   and there's some kid in Sri Lanka
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.360]   or some little girl in Afghanistan
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.840]   who's gonna stumble upon this on YouTube,
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:42.880]   and they're gonna change the world in the next century.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.760]   Because it's not just about America.
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:48.320]   Our story's almost over, right?
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.080]   We were the story of the last 200, 300 years.
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:51.160]   I hope it keeps going.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:52.720]   But there's all these other places in the world,
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:55.000]   Sao Paulo and Africa,
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.240]   where people now have access to these videos.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:02.040]   And somebody will hear this video and go, "Elon did it.
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:03.860]   "Oh, and that guy Jason was his friend.
[02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:06.500]   "Oh, and Lex does those interviews with the,
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.920]   "oh yeah, I could do it too."
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.200]   - Your little magical moment of love
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:12.380]   amidst the suffering with Elon,
[02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:14.320]   because you've talked about it,
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:15.640]   it'll have these ripple effects.
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:16.860]   It's fascinating to think about,
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:18.480]   and that gets to come. - So weird.
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:20.560]   - And new entrepreneurs being born,
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.400]   new, more love being put out there,
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.600]   and more support through these rough times
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.500]   when people are trying to create new things.
[02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:31.340]   I mean, that's a beautiful thing.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:32.180]   That's a beautiful,
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:35.400]   I'm glad you think of friendship in this way.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:39.440]   I'm deeply grateful that you're loyal
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:41.680]   in the way you are. - Every time you invest,
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:42.840]   here's the thing,
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.400]   it costs you nothing to make this investment either.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:49.920]   The amount of time it takes to be bitter or angry,
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:53.560]   sitting at home, to be disappointed,
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.720]   you could just channel that same amount of energy
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:59.640]   into being loyal, loving, kind, and there for people.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:02.220]   It just only takes the intention, right?
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:05.040]   The water's gonna, those emotions are gonna flow, right?
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.020]   Like Sam would always tell me
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:08.100]   when I was struggling in my life,
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.840]   and I talked to him, he'd say,
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.640]   "Jason, your brain is spewing all these ideas.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:15.120]   "Imagine you're sitting by a river,
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.120]   "and the river is all your ideas.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.900]   "You are not a slave to any one of these ideas.
[02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:20.220]   "They're just whipping by,
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:22.300]   "like each of those little waves in the river.
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.920]   "You can pick one of those ideas out
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.600]   "and look at it and examine it,
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:26.680]   "and either keep it,
[02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:28.860]   "or throw it back in the river and let it go."
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:30.080]   And I was like, wow, Sam.
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:32.820]   That was like, of my entire friendship with Sam Harris,
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:34.600]   that was like the one moment where I was just like,
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:37.420]   "Oh my God, all my life I've wondered
[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:39.580]   "about all these thoughts in my head.
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:43.340]   "Insecurities, you know, imposter syndrome.
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:45.480]   "Like I didn't go to MIT.
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:48.620]   "You know, I'm not the smartest guy,
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:52.560]   "but somehow I made a career writing little 50K checks,
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:54.040]   "and now, you know, $3 million checks,
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:55.320]   "but whatever, you know, little checks,
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.560]   "and being a journalist and doing this little podcast."
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:59.740]   And it's added up to something.
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:01.680]   And I'm proud of it.
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:04.280]   I'm 50 and I'm kind of proud of what I did.
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.160]   And I wake up every morning, I'm super tired,
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:09.280]   I say, "I kind of like what I do.
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:10.840]   "I kind of like having the conversation
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:12.200]   "and writing the check,
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.640]   "and then being on somebody's team."
[02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:16.360]   And I got offered to be in these giant mega funds.
[02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:18.180]   And they said, "Jason, you're an idiot.
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:20.540]   "You invest in 60 companies a year,
[02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:22.080]   "you know, 500K at a time,
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:23.800]   "you put $30 million a year to work.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:25.140]   "Come work with us,
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:27.700]   "write one $50 million check,
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:32.180]   "and then you can go to Aspen and Cabo and Coachella
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:33.020]   "and not work.
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:35.980]   "But why are you doing all this work?"
[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:39.220]   It's like, well, the $50 million check is,
[02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:40.340]   like, it's like a formality.
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:41.420]   It's just like being an ATM.
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:43.880]   Like, the companies are already huge by that time.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:46.580]   I really wanna meet the two people with the idea.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:48.540]   I wanna meet them in year one.
[02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:49.380]   - Yes.
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:51.060]   - I wanna meet them on day zero.
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.540]   I wanna be the guy who wrote the first,
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:53.780]   second, or third check.
[02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:55.780]   I wanna be the guy who wrote the 3,000th check,
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:57.020]   the last check.
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:58.020]   It's fucking boring.
[02:06:58.020 --> 02:07:00.020]   - And make that basic human connection.
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:00.860]   - Totally.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:03.620]   - And also be there, be with them through the rough times,
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:05.440]   be with them with that first,
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:07.220]   I mean, the first early successes,
[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:08.060]   I mean, that's a beautiful--
[02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:08.900]   - Oh, so great.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:13.900]   When a founder and their team get product market fit,
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:16.420]   and you just know it's gonna work,
[02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:18.380]   oh man, Lex, it's,
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:21.540]   when Com would email me and they'd say,
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:24.100]   we added, the company's been growing
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:25.700]   and we're not gonna go out of business,
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:27.260]   but we added some sleep stuff
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:29.780]   and then we added this other function
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:31.340]   and we have a streak now.
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:36.860]   We grew 10X in the last three months.
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:38.540]   And we're good.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:40.220]   I was like, oh, that's nice.
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:41.060]   It's real nice.
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:42.900]   It's a nice feeling when you,
[02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:44.100]   well, because so many of them die.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:45.920]   We talked about that J curve early.
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:47.240]   Imagine it's like,
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:51.700]   it's like all these baby turtles going out to the ocean
[02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:53.580]   and the seagulls are ripping them to shreds
[02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:56.200]   and then the sharks are eating them.
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.700]   But then like a couple of the turtles make it
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:01.940]   and they become wise old, 100 year old turtles.
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:02.780]   You know?
[02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:03.600]   And you're like, yep.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:06.100]   I remember when you catched
[02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:08.260]   and like all of your brothers and sisters
[02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:09.740]   were ripped to shreds by the seagulls
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:11.460]   and you made it into the water.
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:13.500]   And then you made it out to the deep water.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:14.580]   It's a pretty great feeling.
[02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:17.220]   - I think there's no better way to end it.
[02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:18.180]   - There it is.
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:20.260]   - The talk of the cruelty of life,
[02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:22.180]   that suffering that is life
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:24.060]   and the love amidst the suffering.
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:26.840]   Jason, I've been a fan of yours for a long time.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:30.620]   You're one of the most special people in Silicon Valley.
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:31.460]   - Thanks, Lex.
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:34.740]   - And maybe you'll also call me in one of the rough times.
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:35.580]   - Oh yeah.
[02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:36.400]   - I'm sure there'll be many.
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:37.240]   - There will be, yeah.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:39.220]   You know, there's one expression.
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:41.180]   Nobody gets there alone.
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.580]   Nobody gets there alone.
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:45.120]   And anybody who thinks that they got there alone
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.060]   is delusional and kidding themselves.
[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:48.940]   And they will at some point wake up and realize,
[02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:52.580]   oh shit, there were a lot of people helped me get here.
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:54.480]   I need to write a couple of gratitude letters.
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:55.820]   I got a gratitude letter the other day
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:57.900]   from a friend of mine who I helped.
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:59.460]   And I was one of the,
[02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:02.080]   you know about these gratitude letters people are writing?
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:04.220]   It turns out Martin Seligman in,
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:07.940]   was it Authentic Happiness?
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:10.820]   Anyway, the guy who really studied happiness and joy,
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:15.100]   turns out one of the greatest amplifiers of joy in your life
[02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:17.740]   is to thank somebody for doing something for you.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:22.060]   And somebody who I had helped just wrote me a letter.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.460]   And I got in Christmas and I had the stack of Christmas cards
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:25.580]   and I hadn't opened them.
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:27.620]   And it's the second week of January
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:29.980]   and I was just getting to like the last stack.
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:32.660]   And I open it up and I almost missed it.
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:33.880]   It's an incredibly heartwarming letter
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:37.220]   about how meaningful like certain things I had done
[02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:38.860]   to help along the way
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:41.700]   and how he'd always appreciated my counsel.
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:46.460]   And I was just like, well this happened 25 years ago.
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:48.420]   And you wrote this letter now.
[02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:50.300]   And it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.980]   And I was just like, wow, you know,
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:53.460]   if you're hearing this,
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:54.660]   there's probably 10 people
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:58.080]   who are really instrumental in your lives, in your lives.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:00.420]   Go ahead and call them on the phone,
[02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:02.220]   write them an email, or even better,
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:05.340]   just write a letter and send it to them
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:06.980]   and just tell them you're thankful.
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:08.500]   And let me tell you something,
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:13.180]   the amplification of joy in your life will go 100X, 100X,
[02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:15.380]   when you tell somebody you love them
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:16.980]   and that you really appreciate them
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:18.540]   and that what they did for you was magical.
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:21.400]   So just, and you can look it up, gratitude.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:23.860]   Gratitude is like one of these incredible forces.
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:24.700]   - Amen.

[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:28.300]   (Lex laughing)
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:29.860]   You wasted all this time with me.
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:30.700]   I love it.

[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:55.700]   from the man himself, Jason Kulakanis.
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:58.420]   The number one reason a startup shuts down
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:00.600]   is not running out of money.
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.420]   The number one reason a startup fails
[02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:05.980]   is that the founder gives up.
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:09.980]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
