[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.060]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.300]   Today, we are discussing meditation.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.700]   We are going to discuss the science of meditation,
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.820]   that is, what happens in the brain and body
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.460]   while we are meditating,
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.540]   and we will talk about the science of meditation
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.060]   as it relates to how the brain and body change
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.800]   as a consequence of meditation.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.420]   That is, what you export or take from a meditation practice
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.680]   that can impact everything from your sleep to your mood.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.440]   For instance, meditation has been shown
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.940]   to alleviate symptoms of depression,
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.280]   and we will also talk about how meditation can be used
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.980]   to enhance focus and other states of mind
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.000]   that are useful for work and other aspects of life.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.420]   Now, of course, most of you have probably heard
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.680]   of meditation, and when we think of meditation,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.020]   most often we think of somebody either sitting
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.940]   or lying down.
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.580]   If they're sitting, we might imagine them
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.040]   in the so-called lotus position, you know,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.780]   sitting with legs crossed, very upright,
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.580]   with hands on the knees or, you know,
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.900]   crossed in our lap or something of that sort.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.580]   Typically, we think of somebody who's in a very calm state,
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.080]   eyes closed, focused on their so-called third eye center.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.180]   The third eye center is the area just behind one's forehead.
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.960]   There's no third eye there, at least there shouldn't be,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.800]   but I'll tell you why it's called the third eye center
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.100]   and what the origins of that are
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.180]   and why it's relevant, actually, for a meditative practice.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.700]   With all that said, it turns out that meditation encompasses
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.360]   a huge variety of different practices.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.460]   Some of those practices indeed are done sitting
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.220]   or lying down with one's eyes closed,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.920]   focusing on the third eye center.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.100]   Other of those practices are focused on a body scan,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.340]   you know, really focusing on one area of the body
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460]   and its contact with whatever surface you happen
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.020]   to be sitting or lying on, or can be done walking.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.200]   In fact, there are walking meditations done with eyes open.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.080]   So there are many different forms of meditation,
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.560]   but today we are going to focus mainly
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.740]   on how specific types of meditation
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.700]   and specific areas of the brain that are activated
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.660]   during those meditations change our way of being
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.860]   in fundamental ways, not just during the meditation practice
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.900]   but afterwards as well.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.460]   So if you're somebody who's interested
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.940]   in changing your default state of mood or of thinking
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.360]   or enhancing your ability to focus or improving your sleep
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.400]   or improving performance in some cognitive
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.140]   or physical endeavor, meditation is powerful,
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.100]   but you want to make sure
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.520]   that you pick the right meditation practice.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.420]   So we will talk about picking a meditation practice
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.620]   that isn't just feasible because you'll do it,
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.400]   but is actually directed at the goals specific to you
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   and what you need most.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.480]   So to give you some sense of the contour of today's episode,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.020]   first I'm going to talk about some of the underlying biology,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.600]   the mechanisms and the brain areas,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.260]   and also the areas of the body that are activated
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.880]   during certain forms of meditation,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.900]   and equally important, which areas of the brain and body
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.040]   are shut down or reduced in their activity
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.300]   during specific types of meditation.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.640]   Then I'll transition into
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.100]   how to best do a meditation practice,
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.940]   how to get the most out of that meditation practice.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.180]   And then I will talk about
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.800]   how to change or alter your meditation practices
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.400]   according to your specific goals
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.480]   and as you get better at meditation.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.180]   And this can get a little bit counterintuitive,
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.500]   but in a positive way.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080]   What I mean by that is for instance,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.140]   a lot of people think that as you meditate
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.240]   and get better at meditating,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.580]   you need to meditate more and more and more.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.020]   Sort of like if you get better at running endurance races
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.940]   that you need to keep running longer and longer,
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.500]   first a 5K, then a 10K, then a marathon, then ultras.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.660]   With meditation is actually quite the opposite.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.180]   The better that you get
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.180]   at dropping into a particular brain state
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.660]   and the more your so-called traits of brain state shift,
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.820]   not just states as they're sometimes referred to,
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.720]   but traits, this is a theme that I've picked up
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.860]   from a terrific book that I'll refer to later.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.140]   But the more that you can get
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.420]   into specific neural circuits quickly,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.240]   actually the less you need to meditate
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.060]   in order to derive the benefits of meditation.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.460]   So that's a wonderful aspect of meditative practices
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.260]   that's unlike a lot of other forms of mental exercise
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.280]   and cognitive enhancing exercises.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.780]   So we'll talk about all of that today.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.140]   And I promise that by the end of today's episode,
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.520]   you will have a rich array of meditative practices
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.360]   to select from.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.880]   You'll know why each of them work
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.300]   and why they can be directed toward particular goals
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.540]   and how to do that.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.380]   And you'll also know
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.920]   how to modify those meditation practices
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.800]   under conditions where you might get busier
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.900]   or where you're suffering from lack of sleep.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.460]   I think a lot of people will be excited to know
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.860]   that today we're going to discuss
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.340]   a specific form of meditation
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.240]   that can indeed reduce your need for sleep
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.940]   and still allow you to enhance your cognitive
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.340]   and physical abilities.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.060]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.420]   that this podcast is separate
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.740]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.920]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.860]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.880]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.140]   to the general public.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.260]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.980]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.220]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.660]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.260]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.940]   to help you better understand your body
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.480]   and help you meet your health goals.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.520]   Now, I've long been a believer
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.160]   in getting regular blood work done
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.420]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.540]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.000]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.480]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.900]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.160]   is that you get information back about hormones,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.500]   blood lipids, et cetera,
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.220]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.700]   InsideTracker makes understanding all of that very easy
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.640]   and even better points to specific directives,
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.820]   that is, things you can do in terms of your lifestyle,
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.980]   your nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.860]   in order to bring those numbers related to metabolic factors,
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.300]   lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.560]   into the ranges that are optimal for you,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.620]   your immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.300]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.140]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.620]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.340]   to get 20% off.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.840]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.620]   And to be honest, I am not a fan of the word nootropics.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.580]   I've said this many times before on this podcast
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.540]   and other podcasts.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.460]   And the reason I don't like the word nootropics
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.740]   is that it means smart drugs.
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.460]   And as a neuroscientist,
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.160]   I'm aware that there are neural circuits,
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.240]   that is, connections in the brain and body
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.900]   that underlie things like focus
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.960]   or our ability to switch tasks or creativity, et cetera.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.580]   There is no neural circuit for being smart.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.380]   And so Thesis understands this, and as a consequence,
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.980]   they've developed custom nootropics
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.920]   that are designed to bring your brain and body
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.420]   into specific states to become, for instance, more focused
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.180]   or to engage in creative work
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.500]   or to have more energy for workouts and things of that sort.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.000]   At Thesis, you can go there, you take a brief quiz,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.580]   and they will design a kit
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.840]   of four different custom nootropics that you can try
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.780]   and then modify along with their help
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.120]   so that you can develop a kit of custom nootropics
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.180]   that are perfect for your needs,
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.620]   perhaps one for creativity, another one for motivation,
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.940]   another one for focus, and another one for energy.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.400]   They'll build those for you.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.340]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.100]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.740]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.300]   and use the code HUBERMAN at checkout
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.400]   to get 10% off your first box.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.760]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.940]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.900]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.420]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.340]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.160]   Now, I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.060]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.980]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.740]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.020]   Roca understands this and has designed their sunglasses
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.380]   and eyeglasses to be worn
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.080]   in any number of different conditions
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.940]   and for you to still be able to see with crystal clarity.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.260]   They were designed for things like cycling and running,
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.140]   so they won't slip off your face if they get sweaty.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.180]   They're extremely lightweight.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.660]   In fact, most of the time, I can't even remember
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.480]   that they're on my face.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.320]   They're so lightweight.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.280]   However, they also can be worn anywhere,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.780]   to work, to dinner, et cetera.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.860]   They have a terrific aesthetics.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.120]   Unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.540]   you can only find in designs
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.200]   that really make people look like a cyborg.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.680]   Roca makes the cyborg versions.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.180]   Some people like those, but they also make versions
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.340]   of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with frames
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.980]   that you can wear out to dinner, to work, et cetera.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.160]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.880]   go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.260]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.500]   with Momentous Supplements.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.820]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.040]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.660]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.240]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.620]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.800]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.920]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.280]   Let's talk about meditation.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.880]   As I mentioned earlier, we are going to talk about
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.800]   what areas of the brain and body are active
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.140]   during meditation and after meditation,
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.180]   and why that can be so beneficial.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.440]   We will also talk about when and how best
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.460]   to meditate.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.880]   This is a topic I've long been interested in.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.660]   I was first given a book on meditation
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.160]   when I was in high school,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.120]   'cause to make a long story short,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.080]   it was a bit of a wild one early in my high school years.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.820]   And as a consequence of a program that I was in,
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.320]   somebody handed me a book on meditation.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.280]   That book is still available now.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.720]   That book is called "Wherever You Go, There You Are"
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.400]   by Jon Kabat-Zinn.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.280]   He was one of the first, not the only,
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.980]   but one of the first people to really start popularizing
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.640]   meditation mindfulness practices in the United States.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.320]   So this was in the late 1980s.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.980]   And it was really only until recently
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.580]   that there were very few studies of meditation,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.920]   although those really picked up in the '90s.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.500]   Now you can find many, many thousands of studies
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.460]   on meditation and their mechanistic basis
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.380]   of brain imaging studies, changes in hormones in the body.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.720]   But in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.680]   because functional imaging of the brain,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.800]   so-called MRI or FMRI was really just starting to emerge
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.640]   as a popular tool in laboratories and hospitals,
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.740]   there really wasn't that much mechanistic understanding
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.220]   about how meditation worked.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.540]   But of course, there was a deep understanding
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.160]   from cultures outside the United States
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.600]   that meditation was extremely useful.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.440]   I should just mention,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.940]   as long as we're talking about the history of meditation,
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.080]   any discussion about meditation
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.740]   is going to be a discussion about states of mind.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.740]   And any discussion about states of mind
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.220]   invokes the word consciousness,
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.900]   a kind of a dangerous topic to get into in any format,
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.960]   because a lot of people talk about consciousness,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.600]   but people use consciousness,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.140]   the word, to mean different things.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.660]   It doesn't have one standard operational definition,
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.420]   as scientists call it.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.160]   However, discussions about consciousness
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.060]   are often part and parcel with conversations
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.960]   about things like psychedelics
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.860]   and kind of alternative therapies.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.980]   And so in the 1960s, and especially in the 1970s,
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.880]   meditation and psychedelics were actually close cousins
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.180]   in the conversation about consciousness and states of mind.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.900]   That conversation started to split
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.500]   into two different divisions,
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.580]   and I'll explain why in a moment.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.540]   It gets to a little bit of interesting academic sociology,
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.220]   but what happened was there were a couple of guys at Harvard
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.180]   including Timothy Leary and others
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.540]   who got really interested in psychedelics,
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.140]   in particular, LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.180]   And at that time, that was part of the whole
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.340]   counterculture movement.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.380]   It was considered very anti-establishment,
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.540]   and they were really encouraging students at Harvard
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.600]   to take LSD.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.780]   They were also very interested in meditation,
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.000]   but what ended up happening is they essentially got kicked
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.900]   out or fired from Harvard.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.580]   And there's a book that I'll refer you to
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.660]   in the show note captions,
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.300]   if you're interested in learning more about all this,
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.680]   but they got kicked out and fired
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.740]   for their emphasis on psychedelics.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.700]   Nowadays, there's a lot of interest in psychedelics.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.020]   We've had episodes with Dr. Matthew Johnson
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.300]   from Johns Hopkins University,
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.300]   who's running clinical trials on psychedelics
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.600]   like psilocybin and LSD
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.020]   for the treatment of depression and PTSD.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.700]   We've also had Dr. Nolan Williams on the podcast,
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.420]   my colleague at Stanford, who's doing incredible studies
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.060]   on some of those compounds as well.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.980]   So nowadays, the conversation about psychedelics
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.620]   is coming back, and it's somewhat divorced
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.700]   from the conversation about meditation.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.460]   But in the 1960s and 1970s,
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.860]   the conversation about psychedelics and meditation
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.480]   was sort of one in the same.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.740]   That changed in the late 1980s and early 1990s
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.700]   when people like Jon Kabat-Zinn started writing books
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.220]   that were purely about meditation
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.020]   and suggesting that people explore meditative practices
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.660]   for the utility to bring calmness, adjust stress,
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.860]   improve sleep, et cetera,
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.460]   divorced from the conversation about psychedelics.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.620]   Now, that's not to say that the scientific community
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.300]   immediately embraced the conversation about meditation.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.680]   In fact, it took quite a long while
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.140]   for schools like Harvard and Stanford
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.780]   and other universities around the world
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.020]   to start embracing and funding studies of meditation,
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.040]   asking what sorts of brain areas are involved,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.260]   how it changes the body,
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.900]   and perhaps most importantly,
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.560]   how a meditation practice can shift the brain and body
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   when somebody is finished meditating
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.700]   and is off in their life doing their everyday things.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.680]   In the late 1980s and especially within the 1990s,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.460]   the advent of brain imaging technology
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.180]   like magnetic resonance imaging, MRI,
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.060]   or functional magnetic resonance imaging
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.580]   was a way to look at the brain while it was active,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.380]   not just to get an image of its structure,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.740]   but also how it's functioning,
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.500]   the areas that so-called light up.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.580]   When all of that technology became accessible and popular,
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.740]   well, that allowed a large number of laboratories
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.500]   to start asking how specific patterns
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.020]   of thinking and breathing,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.680]   maybe people sitting in the lotus position,
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.640]   but more often than that,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.020]   it would be people inside of an MRI magnet,
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.860]   because it is a magnet,
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.140]   sort of put you into a little tube
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.420]   and push you into the tube,
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.500]   not against your will, of course,
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.980]   but put people into the tube,
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.000]   have them meditate and then look at how the brain changed
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.580]   and to do that over time.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.080]   When those studies were done,
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.660]   what was discovered was really quite miraculous, really.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.640]   And now we don't think of as surprising,
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.580]   but what was discovered was a huge laundry list
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.820]   of brain changes.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.220]   And then when people were evaluated in their outside life,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.100]   so when they would fill out reports
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.780]   of their subjective feelings of happiness,
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.040]   or they would report their sleep,
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.380]   or even if objective measures were taken,
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.260]   like changes in hormones or markers of inflammation, et cetera,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.260]   a large list of information fell out of that,
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.020]   which revealed that indeed there are many,
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.700]   a dozen or more clear benefits
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.600]   of a regular meditation practice.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.900]   And some of those meditation practices could be quite short.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.840]   So nowadays we think of meditation
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.180]   as pretty commonly accepted.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.780]   And in fact, that has a lot to do with the fact
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.900]   that many of the major tech companies in the Bay Area
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.200]   during the 2000s, such as Google and Apple
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.640]   and any number of different social media companies
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.140]   and other companies and business ventures, et cetera,
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.540]   and investment firms all over the world
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.020]   started hiring people to train meditation
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.560]   or had online courses for meditation.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.820]   So nowadays we think of meditation as this thing
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.180]   that almost everybody understands can benefit us,
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.240]   but we now sit at an interesting frontier
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.500]   where most people think of meditation as one thing,
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.780]   sort of like the word exercise,
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.340]   which of course could mean weight training.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.180]   It could be running.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.380]   It could mean high intensity interval training,
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.900]   all of which, as you know, will get you different results
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.060]   depending on what you do, how often you do it,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.740]   and the specifics of what you actually do.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.520]   So too, meditation can give you very specific results.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.260]   It can give you more focus.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.580]   It can give you better sleep.
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.100]   It can give you a combination of results
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.020]   just like exercise can, depending on the exercise.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.580]   So what we are going to talk about next
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.380]   is the specific changes that happen in the brain
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.640]   with specific aspects of meditation.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.180]   That is, what happens when you close your eyes?
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.900]   What happens when you focus your attention inward
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.540]   versus focusing your attention outward?
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.940]   Because as I mentioned before,
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.820]   there's third eye meditation where you close your eyes
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.100]   and focus on that spot just behind your forehead,
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.580]   and you focus on your breathing.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.100]   There's also meditation practices
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.580]   where you're focusing on what you're eating
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.240]   with a lot of so-called mindfulness,
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.140]   being very present to whatever's happening,
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.140]   not letting your mind wander or think about yesterday
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.820]   or tomorrow, what's happening next,
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.220]   but really focusing on the present.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.420]   There are also meditation practices, of course,
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.720]   where you are in a format of interpersonal communication,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.800]   where you're really listening very intensely.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.620]   That too is a form of mindfulness.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.300]   So we're going to parse each of these things,
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.420]   and we are going to ask,
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.860]   what's happening in the brain and body
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.960]   during each of these meditation practices
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.860]   so that you can develop specific meditation practices
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.260]   that you can invoke in your real life on a daily basis,
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.120]   or thankfully, I would say for some who are pretty busy,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.900]   that you could even do once a week or even once a month
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.340]   that will still clearly benefit you in specific ways.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.500]   I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.100]   talking about the neuroscience of meditation.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.000]   I promise you, I'm not going to just list off
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.220]   a bunch of different brain areas
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.660]   that are active during meditation.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.720]   That wouldn't be useful to you.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.580]   In fact, I don't believe in throwing out
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.860]   a lot of nomenclature
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.840]   without also giving some mechanistic explanation
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.140]   as to what different brain areas do.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.660]   And you could say, well, what good is it
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.760]   knowing what different brain areas do in their names
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.940]   if I can't actually manipulate those brain areas?
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.080]   But the good news is you actually can manipulate
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.300]   those brain areas.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.180]   As I'll tell you today,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.280]   you can turn up the activity in certain brain areas
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.020]   and turn down the activity in specific brain areas
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.840]   with specific elements of a meditation practice.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.300]   So that's quite exciting and quite different really
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.920]   from other aspects of neuroscience
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.100]   that we might discuss on this podcast.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.060]   So there are a few different brain areas
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.220]   whose names I'd like to arm you with.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.220]   And again, the names themselves aren't essential,
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.240]   but if you can grasp even the top contour
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240]   of what I'm about to say,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.540]   you'll be in a much better position
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.840]   to parse and use the information that follows.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.340]   There's an area of your brain
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.260]   that sits right behind your forehead
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.240]   that's called the prefrontal cortex.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.620]   Basically, it's the front bumper of your head
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.660]   just behind the bone, okay?
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.960]   That area just behind your forehead
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.680]   that we call the prefrontal cortex
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.840]   actually encompasses a lot of different things.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.780]   And actually you have two of them.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.440]   You have one on the right side of your brain
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.220]   and you have one on the left side of your brain
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.460]   and they're connected to one another,
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.400]   but they actually do different things.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.060]   The area that I'd like to focus on today for a bit
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.940]   is the so-called left prefrontal cortex.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.780]   So if we were going to get really specific,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.660]   we'd say the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.420]   Dorsal means up, lateral means to the side.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.500]   So if you want to touch the left side of your head
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.820]   and move your hand just toward the midline,
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.000]   toward the sort of top of your head a little bit,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.020]   so that's dorsal, and then lateral.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.580]   As long as your hand is still on the side of your head,
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.580]   you're in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, okay?
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.620]   So you've got your hand probably right over
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.500]   your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.240]   That area of the brain we know from lesion studies
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.940]   where it's been damaged in animals or humans,
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.880]   and we know from stimulation studies
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.080]   where it's been selectively stimulated in animals,
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.780]   or yes, indeed, also it's been done in humans,
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.440]   has an incredible ability to control your bodily senses
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.300]   and to make sense, that is to interpret what's going on
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.440]   in terms of your emotions and your bodily sensations.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.780]   So from now on, unless I say otherwise,
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.500]   if I say prefrontal cortex,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.700]   I'm specifically referring
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.940]   to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.060]   but I'm going to shorten that up
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.940]   just for sake of simplicity and ease of communication.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.260]   If I'm going to talk about another area
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.160]   of prefrontal cortex, I'll talk about another area.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.940]   But if I say prefrontal cortex today,
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.920]   what I mean is left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.740]   Stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.480]   or I should say more appropriately,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.320]   when your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is active,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.940]   you are in a great position
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.220]   to interpret what's going on with you emotionally,
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.540]   to interpret your bodily signals of comfort or discomfort,
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.340]   and then to make really good decisions
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.260]   on the basis of that interpretation.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.980]   And that's because the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.820]   is in direct communication with and is directly connected
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.620]   to another brain area
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.020]   called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.460]   Now I'm just going to refer to it as the ACC, okay?
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.300]   The ACC is an area of your brain
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.300]   that is interpreting a lot of different things
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.700]   about bodily signals.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.280]   For instance, how fast you're breathing,
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.840]   whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly,
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.980]   and more importantly,
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.480]   whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.620]   for the circumstance that you are in.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.500]   So for instance, if you're running up a hill
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.020]   and you're even in great shape
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.060]   and your heart is beating very fast,
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.820]   it's unlikely that you are going to be concerned
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.500]   about your heart beating fast
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.740]   because that is appropriate for the circumstance.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.660]   However, if you're just walking along
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.500]   and all of a sudden your heart starts beating very quickly
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   for no apparent reason,
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.460]   well, then you are going to interpret that
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.060]   as either pathologic or uncomfortable,
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.140]   inappropriate for the context that you happen to be in.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.040]   The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.420]   is the area of the brain that actually has some control over
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.460]   and especially can interpret
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.660]   what's going on in this ACC region.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.140]   Now, most of you probably haven't heard of the ACC.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.460]   Most of you probably have heard of a brain area
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.300]   called the amygdala.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.700]   It's an almond-shaped structure
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.760]   on the two sides of the brain.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.100]   People talk about it as the fear center, et cetera.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.180]   But your ACC, the intercingulate cortex,
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.180]   gets input from areas like the amygdala,
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.340]   your threat detection centers,
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.580]   but it also gets input from an enormous number
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.460]   of other areas of your brain and body,
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.900]   including your heart, your gut.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.700]   So it gets information about how full that is distended
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.680]   or how empty your gut is.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.980]   It gets information about how quickly you're breathing
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.460]   from input from your lungs and related structures.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.980]   It's an absolutely critical station
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.220]   for making sense of what's going on in your body.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.340]   And it works very closely along with one other structure.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.500]   And I promise it's going to be the third structure
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.980]   in this triad, and then I'll stop listing off names.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.480]   We have dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.960]   Think of that as sort of the interpreter
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.860]   of what's going on inside of you.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.860]   You have the ACC, or anterior cingulate cortex,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.060]   which is the area of your brain
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.060]   that's bringing in all this information
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.220]   about what's going on inside your body
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.100]   and even on the surface of your body.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.500]   If you have any pain or an itch or a mosquito bite
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.340]   on the surface of your body,
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.740]   your ACC would definitely register that.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.740]   And then there's this other
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.400]   absolutely incredible brain structure,
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.780]   which is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.100]   And the insula has a bunch of different parts to it,
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.340]   but the insula is another area that is interpreting signals
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.180]   of what's going on in your brain and body.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.300]   So the ACC and the insula are working together
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.260]   to try and figure out what's going on inside me.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.240]   And in addition to that, the insula is interpreting
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   information about what's going on outside of you.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.820]   So your insula is saying, for instance,
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.900]   hey, this is a steep hill that I'm running up.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.020]   And as a consequence, whatever heart rate increase
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.540]   that I'm experiencing or heavy breathing
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.860]   or burning in my lungs, this all makes sense.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.620]   I don't have to be worried, I don't have to be scared.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.100]   I might want to slow down, but this makes sense.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.840]   Whereas it, for instance, in the example I previously gave,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.420]   where if you're sitting in a room
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.060]   and everything is pretty calm, and all of a sudden,
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.600]   you start feeling really uncomfortable,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.960]   like your stomach doesn't feel right,
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.220]   or you start breathing quickly,
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.360]   or you start having a so-called anxiety or panic attack,
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.780]   in large part, that's because the shift
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.340]   in your bodily sensations doesn't match
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.220]   or doesn't correspond to something in the outside world.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.900]   So there's this incredible triad,
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.760]   which includes the left or lateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.900]   the cingulate or anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.940]   And those three are working together
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.180]   in a kind of conversation.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.100]   It's a neural conversation, but a conversation nonetheless,
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.700]   trying to figure out, okay, what's going on inside me?
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.860]   How do I feel?
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.140]   What am I thinking about?
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.600]   And this could be thoughts about the past
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.100]   or the future or the present.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.140]   They are also in a conversation
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.140]   as to whether or not the sensations
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.340]   that you're experiencing, meaning how quick your breathing is
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.900]   or how slow your breathing is,
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.020]   how your heart feels, how your skin feels,
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.600]   any sensations of pain or pleasure for that matter,
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.980]   whether or not that makes sense for the situation you're in
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.980]   and trying to determine whether or not
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.620]   you are doing the right things
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.500]   as a consequence of those sensations, okay?
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.180]   So again, if you can't remember the names
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.940]   of these different neural structures in the brain,
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.860]   don't worry about it.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.340]   It's really not that critical.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.600]   What is critical is that you understand
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.940]   that there's a conversation that's constantly occurring
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.720]   as long as you are awake,
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.060]   trying to figure out what's going on inside of you,
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.340]   whether or not it makes sense
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.520]   relative to what's going on outside and around you.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.900]   Now, humans are smart.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.780]   That is, we are to some extent conscious of the fact
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.800]   that we have memories of the past,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.360]   awareness of the present and anticipation of the future.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.300]   So we do realize, for instance,
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.100]   that we can be seated at the dinner table, excuse me,
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.820]   and have a thought about something tomorrow,
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.920]   maybe an exam that's stressing us out
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.760]   or something like that,
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.960]   and that will change our bodily state
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.820]   in a way that is not optimal
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.560]   for what we're doing in the moment,
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.040]   but that can still make sense to us
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.420]   because that exam is important.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.640]   Maybe we're feeling some pressure
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.320]   about a hard conversation we have to have,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.980]   or maybe we are very excited about the next day
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.460]   and we can't eat because we're so excited,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.820]   and that can make perfect sense to us
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.100]   because we do have access to this knowledge about self
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.900]   that we can think about the past,
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.580]   the present, or the future.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.860]   So that makes the conversation
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.860]   these three structures are in
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.840]   even more interesting and dynamic,
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.800]   because what it means is that we can be doing something,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.280]   eating, talking, running,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.420]   any number of different activities,
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.100]   and our bodily state may or may not match what we are doing
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.540]   in a way that's adaptive for that,
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.100]   and yet that can be completely okay
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.420]   or at least understandable for us.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.820]   Now, a major emphasis of a meditation practice
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.060]   is to make us so-called more mindful.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.020]   What is mindfulness?
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.660]   Well, again, there isn't one perfect
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:29.320]   universally accepted operational definition of mindfulness.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.940]   That's basically nerd speak for saying
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.700]   people can't agree exactly what mindfulness should be,
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.060]   is, and means for everyone,
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.540]   but most people assume, and I think agree,
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.840]   that mindfulness includes something about being present,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.900]   and when I say present,
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.620]   that doesn't necessarily mean present to one's surroundings
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.760]   because, of course, a lot of meditation practices
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.160]   that are designed to make us more mindful and present
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.780]   are designed to make us more mindful and present
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.500]   to what's happening internally
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.940]   while ignoring everything that's happening externally,
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.340]   but they are designed to make us more present
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.500]   to our bodily sensations and, in particular,
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.940]   our breathing and our thoughts in the moment.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.420]   So let's now explore
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.580]   what a generic meditation practice looks like,
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.060]   and let's evaluate how that tends to change the activity
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.900]   of these neural circuits in the brain and body,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.440]   and then from there, we can split the conversation
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.100]   into a couple of different bins,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.680]   that is meditation practices
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.660]   that are ideal for enhancing focus,
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.860]   meditation practices that are ideal for improving mood,
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.480]   meditation practices that are ideal for improving sleep,
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.020]   and meditation practices that, believe it or not,
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.060]   benefit all of those things in one fell swoop.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.260]   Okay, so what happens during a meditation practice
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.860]   at the neural level?
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.580]   In order to answer that question,
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.900]   we are going to be scientists.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.460]   That means you and I are going to be scientists now.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.460]   We are going to break down a practice
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.020]   into its different component parts
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.100]   and address what we know for sure
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.500]   about the brain activation states
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.700]   that occur with those different component parts.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.520]   In order to do that,
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.940]   let's use a somewhat generic form of meditation,
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.340]   but it's generic and pretty far-reaching
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.480]   because I would say that for most people,
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.260]   about 75%, let's say,
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.560]   a meditation practice is going to involve stopping,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.560]   meaning getting out of motion, sitting or lying down,
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.080]   and in most cases, closing one's eyes,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.000]   although it is absolutely not required
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.640]   to close one's eyes during meditation.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.240]   There are many forms of meditation that are done eyes open,
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.160]   but for most people,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.660]   it's going to involve stopping our movement,
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.100]   that is not ambulating, not walking or running,
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.100]   so seated or lying down with eyes closed.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:42.940]   When we do that,
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.080]   meaning when we sit or lie down and close our eyes,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.780]   as trivial as that shift might sound to you,
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.260]   it actually is a profound shift
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.880]   in the way that your brain and other neural circuits
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.920]   in your body function for the following reason.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.060]   When we close our eyes,
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:05.060]   we shut down a major avenue of what's called exteroception.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.040]   What do I mean by exteroception?
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.820]   Well, very briefly,
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.600]   we are sensing things on our body
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.240]   and in our body all the time.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.900]   We are also sensing things from outside of us all the time,
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.880]   so these could be sights or sounds, touch on our body,
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.420]   sensations with inside our body, et cetera.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.040]   Now, sensation is distinct from what we call perception.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.640]   Perception is, put simply,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.080]   the sensations that we happen to be paying attention to.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.960]   So at any given moment, you are sensing many, many things.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.460]   There are sound waves hitting your ears,
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.860]   there are pressure receptors on the bottoms of your feet
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.960]   sensing your shoes or your sandals or the floor, et cetera,
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.380]   but you're not perceiving them
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.840]   until you place your attention on them.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.580]   Now, the way perception works
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.540]   is that you have so-called spotlights of attention.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.200]   You can't perceive everything all at once,
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.180]   every sound, every sight, every touch.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.180]   That would be overwhelming.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.620]   In fact, that would be terrible.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.540]   Rather, you have spotlights of perception
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.500]   that can either be very narrow,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.020]   so for instance, you could focus all of your perception
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.740]   right now on your big toe of your right foot
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.780]   and really pour all of your awareness, your attention,
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.260]   into what you're perceiving there,
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.900]   what it feels like if there's tingling or pressure,
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.940]   heat or cold, et cetera.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.040]   Or you can broaden that spotlight to include both feet
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.620]   or all your toes on both feet
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.860]   and then your legs and your whole body or the entire room.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.760]   Perception is like a spotlight, and I should mention,
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.620]   there are very good data that we can split our attention
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.520]   into two but probably not more than two spotlights,
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.420]   and we can make those spotlights of perception
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.460]   either very broad and diffuse or very narrow.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.000]   You can practice this now if you like.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.580]   You can pick a spot on the wall away from you anywhere,
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.480]   or if you're driving, you can look at some location,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.140]   and you can focus intensely on one small location,
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.980]   for instance, a tree in the horizon
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.480]   or a person on the street
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.740]   or any number of different things outside of you,
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.280]   or you can broaden that spotlight
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.300]   to include the entire scene at once.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.700]   You can also focus a spotlight of perception on your body,
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:12.100]   say on the left upper portion of your chest,
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.700]   and of course, you can focus
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.460]   on the left upper portion of your chest
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.860]   and something outside of you.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.020]   You can split your attention
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.560]   between those two perceptual spotlights.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.300]   It's very hard, although not impossible,
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.620]   to have three perceptual spotlights,
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.020]   but most people can split to two points of attention
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.220]   or perception pretty easily.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.680]   The other thing that most people can do pretty easily
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.120]   is merge those two spotlights,
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.560]   or rather to have just one spotlight of attention.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.600]   So you don't always have to have
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.080]   two spotlights of attention on,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.360]   and here I'm using the word attention
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.080]   and perception interchangeably,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.980]   but you could, for instance, have two points of attention.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.600]   So you're talking to somebody and you're paying attention
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.960]   to whether or not somebody's walking in the door or not,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.340]   so that's two, or you could be completely focused
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.420]   on the person you're talking to,
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.720]   or you could be completely focused on the stomachache
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.600]   or the great sensation of hunger that you have in your belly
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.640]   while talking to somebody.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.880]   In fact, you're not even listening
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.240]   to what they're saying at all.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.420]   Okay, so you have two spotlights of perception.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.520]   You can split them or merge them into one,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.480]   and this is very important.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.000]   Those spotlights of perception can intensify or dim,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.720]   and there I'm using analogy.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.660]   What I mean by that is your perception of what's happening
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.880]   within those spotlights can be very, very high acuity.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.080]   That is, you can register very fine changes in detail,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.400]   like tingling on one side of your big toe
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.440]   of your right foot versus the other,
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.120]   or it can be somewhat more diffuse.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.640]   You're just thinking about your whole toe,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.460]   which in that case seems like a small area,
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.760]   but the point is that you can consciously adjust the acuity
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.800]   that is the fineness of your perception.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.560]   All of this is under your power
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.400]   because of the incredible ability of a brain structure
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.940]   whose name you now understand and know,
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.840]   which is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.020]   although there are other areas
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.600]   of your brain involved as well.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.920]   Your ability to direct your attention
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.480]   to specific things in your environment or within your body,
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.600]   or to split those points of attention or merge them,
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.200]   or dial up the intensity
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.320]   of how closely you're paying attention
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.680]   to every little shift or ripple
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.900]   and change in sensation there,
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.760]   or to kind of dissociate, if you will,
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.840]   for lack of a better word,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.160]   to disengage from that perception.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.880]   All of that is under control because of your ability
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.960]   to engage this area that we call the prefrontal cortex
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.800]   and in particular,
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.440]   the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.960]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.880]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.320]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.700]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.600]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.280]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.500]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.080]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.160]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   once or usually twice a day
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.080]   is that it gets me the probiotics
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.760]   that I need for gut health.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.880]   Our gut is very important.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.440]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.200]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.600]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.240]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.120]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.920]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.120]   In addition, Athletic Greens
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.400]   contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.280]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.740]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.200]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.600]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.560]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.880]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.160]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.460]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.880]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.560]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.920]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.960]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.600]   Okay, so now if we look at the example of what happens
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.460]   when you sit or lie down and close your eyes
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.200]   and decide to meditate,
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.280]   you should immediately realize that that's a tremendous shift
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.240]   in your perceptual ability.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.080]   Why?
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.200]   Because that spotlight of attention,
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.800]   while it can be oriented toward, for instance,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.720]   what you hear in the room,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.080]   or maybe the feeling of wind moving trees
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.980]   in the environment that you happen to be in,
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.560]   when we close our eyes,
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.400]   we shut down one of the major avenues for sensory input,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.380]   which is vision.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.680]   And when we do that,
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.780]   there's a tendency for those perceptual spotlights
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.160]   to be focused more so on what happens
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.840]   at the level of the surface of our skin
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.440]   and inside of our bodies.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.540]   And that informs us about something very important,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.880]   which is that there are actually two axes
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.840]   or two ends of a continuum of perception.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.420]   Up until now, I've been talking about perception
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.060]   and intention as kind of the same thing,
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.180]   and indeed they are, at least for sake of this conversation.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.360]   But within that word, perception,
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.720]   or within that word, attention, there's a continuum.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.500]   And that continuum has, on one end,
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.420]   something called interoception.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.760]   Interoception, spelled with an I,
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.060]   is everything that we sense
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.600]   at the level of our skin and inward.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.280]   So the sensation inside our stomach,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.960]   the sensation of our heart beating.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.020]   Some people can sense their heart beating pretty easily.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.500]   Other people have more challenge doing that.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.680]   What we are feeling on the surface of our skin,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.100]   how hot or cold we feel, that's interoception.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.440]   In contrast, at the other end of the continuum
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.680]   is so-called exteroception, spelled with an E.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.760]   Exteroception is perception of everything
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.800]   that's outside or beyond the confines of our skin.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.000]   So by shutting our eyes,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.040]   and in particular in a meditative practice
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.680]   where we direct our attention
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.420]   toward our so-called third eye center,
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.960]   this area right behind our forehead,
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.520]   which not so incidentally is the prefrontal cortex,
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.200]   or in some cases where people
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.580]   will focus on their breathing,
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.080]   so the movement of their stomach,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.420]   or the movement of their diaphragm,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.760]   or the lifting of their chest,
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.040]   or the extension of their belly while they breathe.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.480]   By doing that, we are taking what ordinarily
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.160]   is a perceptual state that's split
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   between the outside world, exteroception,
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.960]   and usually also toward our inner state.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.540]   Most people are generally in touch
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.900]   with how they are feeling from the skin inward
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.560]   while they are also paying attention
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.000]   to what's outside of them.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.560]   You can think about somebody, for instance,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.060]   at a restaurant or sandwich shop,
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.960]   about to order a sandwich, and you're reading the menu,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.360]   so that's exteroception, right?
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.560]   The menu is outside the confines of your skin,
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.920]   and little ideas or maybe big ideas come to mind
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.280]   about what the roast beef sandwich
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.700]   or the vegetarian sandwich will taste like,
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.820]   what it will do for you, what's in it,
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.060]   what you like, what you don't like, et cetera.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.560]   That's splitting interoception and exteroception.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.120]   But when we close our eyes, we stop, we slow down,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.280]   we focus on our breathing or that third eye center.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.080]   The majority of our perception then shifts to interoception.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.360]   And when we shift down to that end
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.880]   of the continuum of interoception,
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.920]   something very important happens.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   What happens is that those two regions,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.440]   the ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.480]   really ramp up their levels of neural activity.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.880]   And that should make perfect sense to you
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.180]   because those are areas of your brain
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.320]   that are registering and paying attention
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.760]   to the various sensations of how full
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.940]   or empty your stomach feels,
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.420]   whether or not the surface of your skin
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.720]   feels hot or cold, and on and on.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.400]   So by just sitting down or lying down
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.920]   and closing your eyes, your brain undergoes a massive shift
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.540]   from exteroception to interoception.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.280]   Now, that's not to say you can't be distracted
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.620]   by external events, and in fact, many people are,
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.400]   but the early stages of transitioning
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.680]   into a meditative state involve this shift
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   down the continuum, or I should say
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.920]   to one end of the continuum, 'cause there's no down up,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.040]   there's just the continuum.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.640]   Shift along the continuum
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.380]   to heightened levels of interoception.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.920]   Now, I mentioned this briefly before,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.920]   but many people are very interoceptively aware,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.360]   just naturally, even if they don't do a meditation practice.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.000]   Other people are not, and there's a pretty good measure
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.660]   of whether or not you have high levels
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.040]   of interoceptive awareness or capability,
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.420]   and that is your ability to count your heartbeats
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.780]   without placing your fingers anywhere
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.340]   with any pressure to take your pulse.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.480]   You can do this if you like.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.080]   You can actually try and estimate your number of heartbeats
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.300]   simply by trying to feel your heart beat.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.740]   Some people are very good,
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.660]   meaning they're very accurate at doing this.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.880]   Other people are not.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.640]   It does seem to be an ability
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.560]   that can be trained up quite a bit,
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.060]   and in fact, meditative practices
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.480]   will improve your interoceptive awareness,
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.640]   but, and this is a very important point,
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.680]   heightened levels of interoceptive awareness,
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.640]   while that might sound attractive,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.820]   oh, but to be really in touch with your body,
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.580]   that is not always beneficial.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.420]   Why?
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.760]   Because many people who, for instance,
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.640]   have excessive levels of anxiety
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.720]   have excessive levels of anxiety
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.120]   because they are very keenly aware
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.000]   of any subtle shift in their heart rate or breathing
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.200]   or change in the sensations within their stomach,
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.000]   whereas other people who are less aware
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   of their bodily state, that can be beneficial, right?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.960]   It can be adaptive or not, depending on the circumstances.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.640]   It's probably not adaptive to be very, very aware
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.240]   of your internal state.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.920]   If, for instance, you're doing public speaking,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.160]   you don't want to be thinking about what's going on
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.920]   in your stomach or how quickly you're breathing.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.560]   I'm certainly trying to ignore all those signals,
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.320]   those sensations now,
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.680]   but for somebody who has no awareness of what's going on,
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.000]   very little interoceptive awareness,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.840]   that can be problematic too,
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.500]   because these are the very people
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.460]   who can ignore the fact that they're having a heart attack
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.380]   or can ignore the fact that they have high blood pressure
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.200]   and are caring about life focused on everything external
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.880]   with no awareness of their own body.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.680]   They're "out of touch" with their body.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.940]   So we want to be very careful about placing valence,
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.240]   which is a sort of value of good or bad
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   on interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.840]   More importantly, we want to emphasize
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.600]   that when you undergo a meditation practice,
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.880]   if it's of the sort where you stop your movement
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.300]   and close your eyes,
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.340]   you are training for interoceptive awareness.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.220]   This becomes important later.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.880]   We get into discussions about meditation
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.020]   for reducing anxiety.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.400]   Some people may opt,
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.680]   in fact, I would say some people ought to opt
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.840]   for a meditative practice
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.800]   which involves more exteroceptive awareness,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.040]   actually a meditation like a walking meditation
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.520]   or even a seated meditation
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.000]   where they are bringing their focus
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.640]   to a place outside their body
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.520]   as opposed to inside their body.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.680]   And in fact, there are examples of people
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.380]   who have meditated quite a lot
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.100]   who develop such a heightened state or awareness
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.440]   of their interoceptive components,
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.400]   that is just fancy again, nerd speak
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.360]   for so aware of their breathing and of their heart
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.180]   and of the state of their gut
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.180]   that it actually is intrusive for daily activities.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.240]   So I will ask you to ask this question of yourself now.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.040]   Are you somebody who tends to be very in touch
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.880]   with your bodily sensations?
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.380]   So for instance, from the skin inwards,
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.100]   or are you somebody who tends to be less in touch with
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.320]   or aware of your interoceptive state?
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.800]   There is no right or wrong answer.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   You don't get an A or an F or a D or a C
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.840]   depending on your answer.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.360]   It's just a good question
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.120]   for each and every one of us to answer.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.240]   And I think most people will answer that it depends.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.640]   It depends on whether or not you are in a social setting
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.060]   or whether or not you're alone,
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.940]   but we are going to return to that answer.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.280]   So keep it in mind because it will become very beneficial
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.640]   in building an optimal meditation practice for you.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.480]   But for now, just know there's this continuum of perception
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.180]   interoception and exteroception.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.160]   Closing your eyes increases interoception,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.480]   opening your eyes dramatically increases exteroception
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.920]   just automatically,
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.800]   just automatically because so much of your brain,
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.340]   in fact, 40% or more is dedicated to vision.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.440]   And this, I should say,
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.320]   for those of you that are low vision or no vision,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.000]   and those of you that are blind or have poor vision,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.720]   this entire process is translated to the auditory,
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.820]   to the sound domain.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.960]   So it's true for people that can see
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.880]   and it's true for people that can't see.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.920]   Of course, people that can't see,
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.620]   closing the eyes doesn't have this huge shift
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.480]   towards interoception,
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.520]   but there have been a few studies,
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.040]   not as many as I would have liked to find,
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.180]   but a few studies of, for instance,
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.400]   people who are blind or have low vision,
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.240]   don't see very well.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.120]   And when they close their ears
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.020]   and they can't hear the external world
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.440]   or they put headphones on or noise canceling headphones,
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.900]   then the world inside of them becomes very prominent
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.600]   relative to the world outside of them for obvious reasons.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.040]   So I asked you to ask yourself
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.180]   whether or not you are somebody
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.720]   who tends to be more interoceptively aware or not,
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.520]   more exteroceptively aware or not.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.740]   And some of you might not be able to answer that question.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.780]   And if you can't,
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.120]   chances are that you are effectively
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.720]   sliding along that continuum
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.880]   depending on the activities that you're doing.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.480]   So you're probably the kind of person
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.640]   where if somebody comes over to you and starts talking to you
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.440]   you will engage in that conversation
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.180]   and you don't feel so inside your body
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.920]   that you're thinking about your heart beating
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.560]   and whether or not you're flushing red, et cetera,
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.320]   you're going to pay attention to what they say.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.580]   Many people, however, when somebody talks to them,
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.280]   if they have social anxiety
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.580]   or even a slight bit of social anxiety
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.200]   will be thinking about
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.480]   whether or not their cheeks are flushing
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.880]   or whether or not they look right or sound right
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.460]   or whether or not they have something in their teeth.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.260]   These are normal responses,
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.240]   but they really speak to this issue
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.040]   of whether or not you tend to shift more
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.760]   towards interoceptive awareness or exteroceptive awareness.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.360]   And of course it's context dependent.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.700]   It will depend on whether or not you're out on a date
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.800]   with somebody that you would loathe to find out later
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.720]   that you had food in your teeth
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.460]   or whether or not you're with somebody you're more familiar
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.520]   with where that would not really matter much
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.880]   or the other person would tell you this kind of thing.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.340]   What does it mean to be at one location
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.840]   or another location along this continuum
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.040]   of interoception or exteroception?
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.280]   Well, we know what it means neurally, right?
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.460]   We know that if you are more interoceptively aware
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.100]   your insulin, ACC are active, but that's not very useful.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.980]   That's not helpful as a tool, that's just a fact.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.080]   Now there have actually been studies
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.900]   of what a meditation practice can do
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.960]   in terms of moving you along this continuum
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.480]   from where you naturally sit in order to help you function
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.560]   not just during the meditation, but at all times.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   And in order to illustrate this,
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.700]   I want to start with a description
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.040]   of what is now a classic study.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.560]   It's a very cool study, has a very cool name.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.620]   It talks about something very important
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.720]   that will come up again and again in today's conversation.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.400]   That's something called the default mode network.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.960]   The default mode network is a collection
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.560]   of different brain areas that essentially are active
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.520]   when we're not doing much of anything.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.140]   And certainly is active when we are not focused
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.680]   on one particular task or conversation or activity.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.980]   The default mode network can be thought of more or less
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.200]   as the network that generates mind wandering
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.480]   or our thoughts drifting from the past
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.760]   to the present to the future.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.440]   Remember earlier, I talked about how
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.380]   your perceptual spotlight can either be two spotlights
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.760]   or they can merge.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.980]   Well, similarly, human beings can think about the past,
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.200]   surely, the present, definitely, and the future.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.400]   And it turns out we can also split our thoughts
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.420]   just like we can split our perception
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.660]   into two of those three things.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.280]   So I can think about the past, a past event,
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.500]   and I can think about the present.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.220]   I can split my thinking and my memory in that way.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.120]   I can also think about the present and the future.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.140]   I can also think about the future and the past,
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.700]   although it's very difficult, although not impossible,
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.640]   to split one's thinking and memory into the past,
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.580]   the present, and future simultaneously.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.100]   Not easily done, but pretty easy to split one's attention
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.880]   and thinking into two of those three things,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.340]   either the past, the present, and the future,
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:34.080]   or any two of those three things, okay?
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.880]   Just like with attentional spotlighting,
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.740]   you can place your mind, your thinking, and your memory,
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.580]   your cognition onto one of those things
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.780]   that'd be very, very present or the past and the present
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.280]   and so on and so forth.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.520]   The default mode network,
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.580]   while it involves a lot of different brain areas,
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.740]   can be thought of simply as the network of brain areas
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.440]   that are active when your mind is wandering
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.180]   between these different time domains.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.740]   And the paper I'd like to share with you,
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.860]   as I mentioned before, is now a classic paper,
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.180]   has a wonderful title, which is,
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.180]   "A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind."
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.900]   Now, that sounds almost like a news article
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.580]   or a news article about a scientific paper,
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.780]   but that's actually the title of the scientific paper,
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.900]   which was published in the journal Science,
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.440]   which is one of the three apex journals.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.180]   Scientific publishing is competitive,
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.900]   but it's especially competitive to get manuscripts accepted
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.020]   into science, into nature, and into the journal cell.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:31.220]   So it represents kind of one of the Super Bowl,
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.300]   NBA championships, and Stanley Cup, if you will,
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.640]   for you sports aficionados of scientific publishing.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.540]   This is a paper from Matthew Killingsworth and Dan Gilbert.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.580]   It was published in 2010,
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.060]   but it's still considered a classic.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.680]   And this paper, "A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind,"
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.100]   has a number of very important points.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.620]   I'm going to paraphrase certain elements of it for you,
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.220]   because they say essentially what I would like you to know,
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.920]   far better than I could say.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.400]   So first of all, they start out with a statement,
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.680]   which I confess I disagree with,
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.440]   which is, "Unlike other animals,
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.280]   "human beings spend a lot of time thinking
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.560]   "about what is not going on around them,
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.640]   "contemplating events that happened in the past,
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.800]   "might happen in the future, or will never happen at all."
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.680]   I agree with their assertion that human beings do that.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.260]   That's certainly my experience.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.500]   Although I must say,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.900]   I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.540]   that other animals don't do it also.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.840]   So my apologies, Killingsworth and Gilbert,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.560]   but I'd be happy to go toe to toe with you on that.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.160]   I am not aware of any data that prove one way or the other
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.920]   what other animals are thinking.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.980]   So let's set aside other animals
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.440]   and let's focus on the human animal.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.040]   Now, their point is still a very good one,
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.400]   which is that humans have this wandering of the mind
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   that they call stimulus-independent thought.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.220]   That is, there's nothing happening to create these thoughts
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.720]   or anything happening in the immediate environment.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.420]   These thoughts are just happening on their own internally.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.880]   That's the default mode network.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.240]   This study was important.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.540]   In fact, it was a landmark study
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.260]   because they did it right about the time
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.260]   that smartphones became widely available and in use.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.600]   So again, 2010.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.740]   So they basically pinged people.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.740]   They contacted people on their iPhones many times per day.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.960]   And they did this for well over 2,200 adults.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.780]   They had a mix of male and female people in this study.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.240]   The mean age was 34 years,
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.640]   but there was a mean, of course, mean average,
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.560]   but there were a range of different ages and so forth.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.120]   And at any moment they asked people,
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.920]   "What are you feeling right now?"
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.540]   And they also asked them, "What are you doing right now?"
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.600]   So they were looking for the match or mismatch
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.720]   between what people were doing and what they were feeling.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.160]   They were essentially trying to probe
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.720]   what people were thinking about.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.360]   And they also addressed that.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.560]   And they came up with a kind of a bubble chart, if you will,
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.320]   where the bigger the bubble,
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.420]   the more answers came back about one particular thing.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.880]   And they assessed whether or not people were happy or not
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.280]   in that moment or sad or not,
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.220]   whether or not they were focused
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.660]   on what they were doing or not.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.040]   There are a lot of bubbles in this chart,
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.440]   so I'm not going to read them all.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.320]   But the important points that came from the data,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.240]   and again, there's a very large data set,
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.100]   was that, and here again, I'm paraphrasing,
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.180]   first people's minds wandered frequently
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.100]   regardless of what they were doing.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.340]   In nearly half of the samples taken,
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.680]   people were generally thinking about something else,
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.900]   except it turns out there's just one little bubble
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.540]   sitting way far out on the horizon here.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.780]   People claimed, and I'm inclined to believe them,
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.140]   that they tend to be very focused on making love
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.840]   if they were making love in the moment
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.040]   where they were pinged on their iPhone.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.460]   Now, why their iPhone was there with them at that moment,
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:34.300]   I don't know.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.380]   That wasn't included in this description of the study.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.820]   But all the other activities, grooming and self-care,
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.200]   listening to the news, watching television,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.380]   relaxing, working, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.700]   during all those activities,
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.900]   people claimed that their mind wandered a lot.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.340]   And then they also assessed, of course, their mood
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.920]   and how those people felt at any given moment,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.100]   depending on what they were doing
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.900]   and how well their mind and their emotions
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.300]   matched what they were doing.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.960]   And what they say here is second,
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.860]   they revealed that people were less happy
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.300]   when their minds were wandering than when they were not.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.420]   And this was true during all activities.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:16.940]   And then third, what people were thinking at a given moment
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.460]   was far better a predictor of their happiness
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.880]   than what they were doing.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.900]   So this is interesting,
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.460]   and I think matches a lot of people's experience.
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.460]   In fact, I think as you hear about this study,
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.860]   many of you will probably just say, well, duh.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.060]   I mean, if you're working and you don't like your work
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.200]   and you're thinking about something bad that happened,
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.060]   well, then of course you're not going to be happy.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.540]   But the key point of this study is that
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.660]   it did not necessarily have to be the case
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.920]   that people were thinking about something unpleasant.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.700]   In fact, if people were working
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.460]   and they were thinking about something else
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.660]   that was pleasant, that also made them feel unhappy.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.300]   In other words, the mismatch between being in an activity
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.980]   and having our mind elsewhere led people to report
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.640]   themselves as feeling more unhappy in that moment.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.620]   And when you total this up,
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.480]   what you find is that people are often not present
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.660]   to what they are doing,
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.760]   and that is a great source of unhappiness,
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   even if their thoughts are those of happy, joyful thoughts.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.920]   So this is interesting,
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.580]   and I think runs counter to what most of us have heard
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.300]   or have been taught, which is think good thoughts,
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.660]   try and suppress bad thoughts,
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.220]   have a good internal landscape, create a good narrative.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.000]   That is all true.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.140]   But equally, if not more important,
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.060]   is to have the ability to be fully engaged
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.980]   in what you are doing at a given moment.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.980]   That is the strongest predictor of being happy.
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.580]   And there were several other studies
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.540]   that followed up on this,
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.680]   but their conclusion that they put
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.380]   in the final short paragraph of this paper,
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.140]   I think really captures it beautifully.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.580]   They say, and here I'm quoting directly,
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.900]   in conclusion, a human mind is a wandering mind,
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.620]   and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.180]   The ability to think about what is not happening
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.620]   in a moment, I added the in a moment part,
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.900]   is a cognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.920]   So I know I'm not alone in believing that this paper,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.380]   a wandering mind is an unhappy mind,
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.840]   and we will provide a link to this paper
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.140]   in the show note captions,
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.780]   is absolutely key in understanding
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.080]   why a meditation practice is so important,
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.380]   because a meditation practice
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.940]   is really about adjusting your place
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:26.180]   along that interoceptive, exteroceptive continuum
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.540]   to what you happen to be experiencing in that moment.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.800]   And while most people think of a meditative practice
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.460]   as focusing on what's going on internally,
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.060]   with your eyes closed, third eye center,
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.520]   focusing on your breathing, et cetera,
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.460]   for any number of minutes, or maybe even an hour or longer,
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.180]   there are other forms of meditation
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.460]   in which your exteroception dominates,
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.380]   in which you are actively focusing on things outside
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.620]   or beyond the confines of your skin and internal landscape.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.180]   And that too is meditation.
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.700]   And if we are to take the work of Killingsworth and Gilbert,
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.860]   this wandering mind is an unhappy mind, seriously.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.860]   And I know a number of other laboratories have
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.280]   and have supported this research with their findings
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.840]   again and again and again.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.620]   What this means is that meditating
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.180]   is not necessarily a practice
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.180]   that we do divorced from the rest of life.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.260]   Meditation and mindfulness in particular,
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.000]   being present to what we are doing in a given moment,
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:27.420]   is one of the essential keys to happiness and improved mood,
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.300]   even if what we are doing is unpleasant.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.820]   So that brings us to a tool,
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.860]   and it's a tool that any and all of us can use,
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.140]   whether or not you tend to be interoceptively dominant,
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.600]   that you tend to pay more attention
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.120]   to your bodily sensations, or exteroceptively dominant.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.420]   And again, if you don't know the answer to that question,
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.140]   there's a simple test that you can do.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.380]   You can just sit down or lie down, close your eyes,
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.980]   and you can ask yourself or assess
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.620]   whether or not your attention tends
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.820]   to fleet to things outside of you, right?
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.100]   Cars honking or going by, people in the room,
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.940]   or whether or not you tend to be able to focus
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.860]   on your internal landscape to the exclusion of exteroception
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.680]   and attention to things outside the confines
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.100]   of your skin easily.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.740]   Now, of course, this will depend on context and situation,
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.820]   even how well rested you are, et cetera,
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.540]   but that's exactly the point.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:19.180]   This is the sort of thing you want to do
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.400]   every time you decide to do a meditation practice.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.300]   In fact, I would suggest that you use this
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:30.100]   to determine what meditation you do at any given moment.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.620]   So let's say you are somebody who is a regular meditator,
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.620]   or let's say you're somebody who's never meditated
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.220]   and you'd like to develop a meditation practice.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.900]   I suggest that you do a test of whether or not
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.900]   you are more interoceptively dominant
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.340]   or exteroceptively dominant in that moment, okay?
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.460]   Again, this is not a personality trait.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.260]   This is a question about where you happen to be in a moment.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.740]   So let's say you're on a plane or you're in the car.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.020]   If you're in the car, please don't close your eyes
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.300]   while driving, that's sort of obvious,
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.460]   but do this in a safe way, please.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:04.420]   But stop, close your eyes, and assess whether or not
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.080]   you can access and focus your attention
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.740]   primarily on your internal state
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.160]   or whether or not your attention and perception
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.900]   gets pulled to something external, to exteroception.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.020]   And again, that will vary depending on circumstance
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:19.980]   and who you are.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.060]   Then I suggest opening your eyes
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.880]   and trying to focus your attention
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.060]   to something external to you
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.760]   and seeing or evaluating the extent to which
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:32.620]   you can divorce your perception from sensations
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.620]   that occur at the level of your skin or internally.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.700]   Now, I should say that there's no technology,
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.780]   at least not that I'm aware of,
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   absence of fMRI machine,
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.860]   in which case you are inside an fMRI machine
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.700]   while you do this,
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.420]   but unless you are in that experiment,
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.280]   and most of us aren't,
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.420]   there's no technology that can tell you, for instance,
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.480]   whether or not you are interoceptively dominant
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.860]   or exteroceptively dominant
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.140]   and whether or not the ratio is 75 to 25
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.880]   or what have you at any given moment.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.980]   You have to assess this subjectively.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:04.520]   However, if you sit down, for instance,
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.600]   and you notice that you can equally split your attention
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.780]   between internal sensations and external sensations,
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.940]   or whether or not you find yourself
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.480]   pulled into external sensations
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.280]   when you're trying to focus inward,
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.740]   or you find yourself pulled inward
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.200]   when you're trying to focus outward,
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.160]   well, that will dictate the sort of meditation
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.300]   that you perhaps ought to perform in that moment.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.420]   Let me give an example of how you would do this.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.060]   You would stop in some way,
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.900]   so sit or lie down,
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.180]   close your eyes,
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:35.100]   and evaluate whether or not you can essentially rule out
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.500]   or eliminate attention to all outside events.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   Most people won't be able to do that entirely,
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.120]   but try and focus your attention, for instance,
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.080]   on your breathing or the typical third eye center,
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.420]   you know, focusing at a spot right behind your forehead.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.180]   If you feel you can do that reasonably well
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:50.600]   to the exclusion of what's happening around you,
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.620]   well, then an important question arises.
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.220]   Should you meditate in a way
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.700]   to enhance that interoceptive awareness?
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.020]   Or rather, should you meditate in a way,
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:01.600]   for instance, with your eyes open
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.380]   and your attention on a particular portion
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.420]   of the landscape you're in,
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.860]   like a tree or maybe even an object or a plant
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.920]   or something else in your immediate environment,
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.780]   to try and cultivate or enhance
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.780]   your exteroceptive awareness?
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:15.740]   That's up to you,
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.260]   but my bias would be one in which
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.580]   you work against your default state.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.380]   Again, the default mode network
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.380]   is where you land on this interoceptive,
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.440]   exteroceptive continuum
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.720]   is going to lead to more mind wandering,
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.880]   whereas when you encourage,
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.160]   or we could even say force yourself a little bit
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.780]   to anchor your attention
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.280]   to either inside your body or outside your body,
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.520]   and you make that decision
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.780]   according to what you are doing less easily,
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:48.660]   well, then you are actively training up the neural circuits.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:50.640]   You are engaging so-called neuroplasticity,
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.900]   the brain's ability to change in response to experience.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.900]   You are deliberately engaging a shift along that continuum.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.260]   To make this crystal clear, what I mean is this.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.760]   Let me give an example.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.980]   If I were to sit down and I want to do some meditation,
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.600]   let's just say three minutes of meditation,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.020]   there's good evidence that even three minutes of meditation
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.900]   can be beneficial for a variety of things,
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.140]   including enhanced focus and enhanced anxiety management.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.500]   Let's say I sit down and I notice
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.940]   that I can really focus inward on what's happening
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.800]   at the level of my skin and my internal organs,
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.960]   and I can rule out everything.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.340]   Maybe that's 'cause the room is quiet,
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.920]   or maybe it's just because my brain is in a state
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.900]   that I'm particularly good at that at that moment,
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.900]   or maybe it's just a natural ability.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.980]   Well, then I would opt for a three-minute meditation practice
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.020]   in which I deliberately exterocept
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.840]   that I build up the circuitry
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.380]   to focus on something external to me,
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:47.180]   because I want, and I think most people would like,
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:50.340]   to have an adaptive mechanism within them
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.460]   so that they can slide along that continuum,
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:55.860]   and they don't default to whatever happens to be easiest
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:57.700]   for them in that moment.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.060]   Now, if I were to sit down
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.060]   and try and focus on what's going on internally,
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.980]   and I kept getting distracted by things happening
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.540]   outside of me, opening my eyes,
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.240]   or feeling like I need to reach for my phone,
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.300]   or paying attention to the sounds in the room,
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.180]   well, then I would actively engage a meditation practice,
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.040]   in this case, a three-minute example, but it could be longer,
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.780]   where I'm deliberately trying to focus my perception
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.540]   on events at the level of the confines of my skin
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:21.760]   and internally.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.600]   Why do I say this?
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:26.880]   Well, I love to use the phrase anytime with kids
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.280]   when they say, "This is really hard,"
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.320]   or "Something's challenging,"
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.120]   or adults will say, "That's really tough."
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.560]   Well, as my graduate advisor used to say,
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.080]   "That means you're learning."
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.220]   If something were easy,
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:39.180]   if you can perform any activity or thought, et cetera,
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.580]   well, then there is absolutely zero reason
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.620]   for your neural circuits to change.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:46.340]   It's the friction, it's the feeling that something is hard
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.520]   that turns on the enormous variety of mechanisms
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.160]   at the level of cells, et cetera,
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.100]   that allow you to potentially change your neural circuitry.
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:58.200]   So challenge and discomfort is the signal
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.020]   to your brain and body that something needs to change.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:05.180]   So I'm encouraging you to embark on meditative practices
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.560]   that are not your default, okay,
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.300]   to essentially go against the grain
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.540]   of where your interoceptive bias
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.640]   or your extra receptive bias happens to be
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.700]   at a given moment.
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.700]   And again, this will change.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.980]   For some of you, this will change across the day
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.240]   where early in the day, you are very, very good
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.120]   at doing an interoceptive biased meditation,
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.420]   and later in the day, you aren't.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.560]   I actually believe based on the data that I've covered
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.060]   and we'll get into a few more papers about this,
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.580]   and my lab is actively working on this as well,
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.580]   that a meditative practice can be made far more effective.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.060]   That is, it can invoke more neuroplasticity,
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.020]   more shift in brain states and brain circuitry
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.700]   if we do not take the easy path.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.740]   That is, we go against the grain
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.780]   of what our brain would naturally do in a given moment.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.220]   So if you're in a crowded airport
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.600]   and you're finding that everything's very distracting,
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.140]   well, then that would be a great time
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.860]   to do some interoceptive focused meditation.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.060]   Whereas if you are really in your head,
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.160]   you're looping thoughts about the past and present,
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.100]   maybe you're even in obsessive thought,
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.400]   well, that would be a terrific time, an ideal time really,
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.640]   to do a short meditation
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.840]   focused on something external to you.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.800]   In both cases, whether or not you're focused
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.000]   on interoceptive bias or extra receptive bias,
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.160]   you are going against, or I should say you're pushing back
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.300]   against your default mode network.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.260]   I would argue it's going to be far more effective.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.380]   That is, you're going to reduce or shift the activity
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.420]   of that default mode network far more
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.840]   and in a far more beneficial way
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.180]   if you actively try and suppress your bias
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.740]   toward being more interoceptive or extra receptive.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.940]   Now, I think that's immensely beneficial
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.340]   both for the immediate changes that you experience,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.820]   what others have called a state change,
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.280]   'cause that's what it is.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.820]   And it also can lead to, as we referred to earlier,
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:03.920]   more neuroplasticity, more changes in the brain circuits
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.420]   that underlie your default mode network
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.380]   and lead to what are called trait changes.
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.100]   And I want to be very clear that I am not the first
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.820]   to make this state versus trait distinction.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.640]   That's a distinction that was raised
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.100]   in a really wonderful book.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.120]   In fact, I can't recommend this book highly enough.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.580]   The book is "Altered Traits,
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.600]   "Science Reveals How Meditation Changes
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.940]   "Your Mind, Brain, and Body."
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:28.000]   This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.180]   They've done a terrific work in many writings
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.620]   and many TED Talks, et cetera, about meditation.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.340]   I would say that circa 2016, 2017,
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.620]   this book really captured what I believe to be
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.460]   the most essential elements of the science of meditation
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.620]   and a lot of the history of it as well.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.820]   Today, we are focusing on much of what's covered
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.020]   in this book, but also a lot of things
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.780]   that have happened since 2017.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.940]   In fact, most of the papers that I'm going to talk about
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.780]   are papers that were published after 2017.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.880]   But again, there's a wonderful book
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.000]   where they very clearly distinguish
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.080]   between state changes and trait changes,
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.840]   trait changes being the more long lasting ones.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.320]   My read of this book and the literature that follows
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.060]   is, again, that when you sit down to meditate,
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.200]   it is going to be most effective
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.740]   to do that interoceptive, exteroceptive bias assessment.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.140]   Ask yourself whether or not you are more in your head
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.260]   or outside your head, if you will.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.260]   And then to do a meditation practice
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:27.020]   that runs counter to where you happen to be at.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.300]   That is, that pushes you more externally
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.500]   if you're in your head.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.060]   And if you're more focused on what's going on around you,
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.020]   that pushes you more internally.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.440]   Now, I think most people are familiar
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.240]   with how to do an interoceptive biased meditation.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.580]   Again, that would be setting a timer.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.880]   Maybe you don't even set a timer.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.320]   You just sit or lie down, close your eyes,
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.120]   focus on that third eye center behind your forehead
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.940]   or focus on your breathing or your bodily sensations.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.540]   That's typical and often discussed.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.600]   Exteroceptive based meditations,
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.820]   you pick a focal point outside
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.620]   or beyond the confines of your skin.
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.020]   So that could be, for instance, a point on the wall.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.440]   If you are indoors, it could be a plant.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.360]   It could be a point on the horizon far away.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.240]   What you will find is that your visual system
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.280]   will fatigue a little bit
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.720]   when you concentrate your visual focus at that location.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.080]   I want to remind you that it is perfectly okay
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.100]   and in fact necessary to blink.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:17.940]   So you should blink.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.840]   You can relax your face.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.960]   You can change your expression.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.600]   There is no rule that says that you can't do those things.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.040]   This is not just beaming a particular location in space
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.580]   and holding your eyelids open.
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.060]   I've been accused many times of not blinking very often.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:30.980]   That's for other reasons.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.140]   It's part of the way I access memory
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.160]   about what I want to say.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.440]   I don't use a prompter here.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:40.220]   So I'm accessing from a sort of an internal image in my head.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.360]   That's how my memory works.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.580]   But in any case,
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.800]   if you're going to do an exteroceptive biased meditation,
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.180]   there is absolutely no reason
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.380]   why you wouldn't look away from that location
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.220]   every once in a while.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.360]   In the same way that if you're focused on internal thoughts
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.420]   with your eyes closed and focused on your breathing,
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.520]   every once in a while,
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.520]   your thoughts will skip away from that breathing
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.640]   or from your third eye center.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.140]   In fact, and this is discussed in the book "Altered Traits,"
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.540]   but by many other people as well,
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.100]   one of the key elements of any meditative practice,
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.260]   whether or not it's interoceptively focused
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.200]   or exteroceptively focused,
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.600]   is that it's really a refocusing practice.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.960]   The more number of times that you have to yank yourself
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.080]   back into attending or perceiving one specific things.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.120]   In other words, the more times your mind wanders
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.500]   and you bring it back,
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.840]   actually the more effective that practice is.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.080]   Again, if you can just focus on one location
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.320]   with laser precision and your mind never darts away
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.720]   from that and you don't have to bring it back,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.440]   well, then there's no neuroplasticity.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.100]   Nothing needs to change because your nervous system
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.300]   will effectively know it's performing perfectly.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.160]   So if you're somebody who tries to do meditation,
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.580]   you find that your mind just wanders,
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.660]   just remember every time you scruff yourself
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.620]   and pull yourself back
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.820]   to focusing on some location externally,
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.440]   or focus back on your breath or your third eye center,
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.740]   each one of those are just opportunities to do better.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.260]   They are essential to the improvement process.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.460]   Think about them as ascending a staircase of refocusing.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.500]   Every time you refocus, you're going up one more level,
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.900]   another stair, another stair, another stair.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.980]   And I think that will move you away
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.380]   from the kind of judgmental process of thinking,
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.880]   oh, like I can't focus on anything.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.280]   Pretty soon, what you'll notice is
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.520]   that the refocusing process will happen so quickly
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.140]   that you don't even perceive it.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.900]   And again, this is something that's borne out
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.900]   in the neuroimaging data.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.700]   A lot of people think that
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.960]   they can focus with laser precision,
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.600]   but actually what they are better at doing
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.040]   is refocusing more quickly and consistently over time.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.960]   There's a classic study about this
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.280]   in very experienced meditators that was done in Japan
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.920]   where they had people
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.400]   with varying levels of meditation ability.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.280]   So some who had never meditated,
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.020]   others who are really expert meditators
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.840]   with many hundreds, if not thousands of hours of meditation
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.680]   under their belt.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.860]   And they had those people listen to 20 tones
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   repeated over and over, the same tone.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.860]   And they found that the expert meditators
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.160]   could really focus, and they did this by brain imaging,
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.400]   they could really focus on all 20 tones.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.260]   Whereas most people kind of attenuate
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.740]   or what's called habituate to the tone
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.060]   so that by the 10th or 11th tone,
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.500]   their mind is really going to something else.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.220]   Now that's wonderful,
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.380]   but that really just tells us
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.280]   that expert meditators have better focus.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:18.000]   But it turns out that the more modern neuroimaging studies
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.600]   have shown that they don't have better focus
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.400]   such that they're staying in a very narrow trench of focus.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.100]   What they're doing is they're exiting focus
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.260]   and going back in more quickly, more quickly, more quickly,
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.480]   over and over again.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.060]   So rather than think about your ability to focus,
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.040]   think about your ability to refocus.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.180]   And the more number of times you have to refocus,
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.720]   the better training you're getting.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.120]   So earlier I mentioned doing this interoceptive biased
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.420]   or exteroceptive biased meditation for three minutes.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.500]   Why did I say three minutes?
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.220]   Well, three minutes seems like a reasonable number
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.380]   for most people to do consistently, you know, once a day.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.260]   And in fact, there are some studies of one minute meditations
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.680]   and three minute meditations and 10 and 60.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.060]   My laboratory has been studying
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:56.780]   a five minute a day meditation,
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.660]   and that clearly has benefits.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:02.900]   But I think it's also clear that by three minutes,
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.140]   many of the benefits are starting to arrive.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.300]   And so, well,
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.420]   I'm not pointing to any one particular data point here.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.980]   It's very clear that forcing oneself
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:17.220]   to direct one's perception, that is your attention,
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:20.900]   to your internal state or to something external to you
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.220]   is immensely beneficial if you do it consistently
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.540]   and is, again, especially beneficial
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.660]   if you're focusing your attention
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.520]   on the portion of your experience,
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.420]   either internal or external to you,
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.780]   that is not the one that you would default to
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.100]   in that moment.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.660]   And some people have taken this to the extreme to say that,
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.260]   you know, you can even just move about your day
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.220]   and then every once in a while,
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.380]   just do a one breath meditation.
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:46.080]   To be honest, when I look at the whole of the data,
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.720]   it seems as if it doesn't really matter
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.780]   in order to derive most of the benefits
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.180]   of a meditation practice.
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.260]   Now, I'm a big fan of some of the newer meditation apps
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.100]   that are out there.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.840]   One in particular that I've been using
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.160]   and that actually I started using
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.020]   because my dad is a big fan of it
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.180]   and he does now fairly long meditations.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.060]   He's doing about 10 or 20 minutes
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.180]   at least every other day and often every day.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.860]   And he convinced me to check out the Waking Up app
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:12.400]   that Sam Harris has put out.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.740]   I looked at it.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.000]   I think some of it sits behind a paywall,
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.180]   but you can access much of it
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.480]   or at least do a trial and try it out
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.980]   without having to get behind that paywall.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:25.260]   They're not a sponsor of this podcast, I should mention,
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.020]   but I decided to use the Waking Up app.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:28.140]   I think it's terrific.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.920]   And I think one of the reasons it's terrific
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.140]   is that Sam includes short descriptions
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.940]   of what meditation is doing
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:36.580]   and what a specific meditation can do for you
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.700]   just prior to doing that meditation.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.380]   So those meditations can be quite brief.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.260]   Some of them are a minute long, two minutes long,
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.100]   some are longer or even quite a bit longer.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.080]   That app I think includes a variety of meditations
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:52.020]   that really encompasses the huge range of possibilities
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.700]   that are possible with meditation
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.200]   and that at least by my experience of the Waking Up app
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.820]   has led to my most consistent meditation practice.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.100]   And of course, I would love to get Sam on the podcast
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.320]   as a guest so we could talk about the sort of underpinnings
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.240]   of the Waking Up app
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.500]   and his views on everything from meditation
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   to I know he's big in the discussion
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.940]   about free will and consciousness,
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.700]   some of the very deep and somewhat abstract discussions.
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.420]   Really hope to get Sam on the podcast
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:18.980]   at a time not too far from now.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.340]   Meanwhile, we've never met in person,
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.260]   but I absolutely love the Waking Up app, Sam,
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.160]   and I know my father does as well
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.700]   and I know many of you already use it.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:28.820]   If you haven't tried it already,
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   I really do encourage you to check it out.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.960]   I want to talk just briefly
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.980]   about this Third Eye Center business
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.360]   because it turns out to be pretty interesting.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.260]   The third eye is actually a name
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.360]   that's been given to another neural structure,
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.720]   or I should say structure because it's not strictly neural,
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.400]   and that's the pineal gland.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.260]   And this has an interesting history.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.560]   I promise I'm not taking off on a tangent here
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.960]   that isn't relevant to meditation.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.260]   So you have a brain, of course,
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:55.760]   and on both sides of your brain,
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.600]   you tend to have mirror symmetric representations
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.440]   of the same things.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.260]   What do I mean by that?
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.600]   Well, you have a prefrontal cortex on the right,
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.060]   you have a prefrontal cortex on the left,
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.780]   and they actually do slightly different things.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.980]   Language is sometimes lateralized to one side,
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.820]   but in general, for every structure
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.400]   that you have on one side of the brain,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.240]   you have the same structure
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.980]   on the opposite side of the brain.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.880]   There's one clear exception to that,
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.300]   and that's the pineal gland.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.800]   The pineal gland is the gland that makes melatonin,
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.280]   which at night when it gets dark secretes melatonin,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.840]   and that melatonin makes you sleepy,
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.520]   it helps you fall asleep but not stay asleep.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.820]   Descartes, right, the philosopher Descartes,
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.400]   asserted that the pineal was the seat of the soul
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.100]   because it was the one structure in the brain
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.160]   that he saw was not on both sides of the brain.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.780]   It was only one of them and in the middle.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.960]   Now, I don't know if it's the seat of the soul or not.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.840]   I'm not in a position to make assessments like that,
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.540]   but what do we know about the pineal?
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.740]   The pineal, as I mentioned,
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.340]   is involved in releasing melatonin.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.320]   It does a few other things as well,
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.780]   but it is also considered the third eye
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.980]   for a couple of reasons.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:03.100]   One is that it responds to light,
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.920]   although in humans, not directly.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.620]   So in birds and lizards and snakes,
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.260]   they actually either have a thin skull
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.600]   or, believe it or not, two holes in the top of their skull
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.580]   that allow light to go directly in.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.540]   If you look at the head of a snake,
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:18.260]   light can go directly into their brain through these holes
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:21.460]   and activate the pineal to suppress melatonin
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.940]   and control their wakefulness, sleep rhythms.
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.780]   In birds, they don't have holes in their skull,
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.220]   but they have very thin skulls,
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.320]   and believe it or not, light can penetrate
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.740]   the thinness of the skull in many birds
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.820]   and communicates information about time of day
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.100]   and even time of year,
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.180]   and that's translated into hormonal signals
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:42.380]   such as melatonin release from the pineal.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:44.980]   And so the pineal has been called the third eye
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:48.260]   because it's a light-sensitive organ inside the brain.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.140]   In humans, the pineal sits deep, deep, deep to the surface,
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.540]   and light cannot get in there.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.220]   In fact, if light can get into your brain,
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.420]   unless you are part of a specific experiment
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.220]   where that's the intention,
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.640]   or you're having neurosurgery or something of that sort,
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.440]   then you've got serious issues happening.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.620]   That pineal sits deep, deep, deep
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.860]   near what's called the fourth ventricle,
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.760]   and it absolutely should not see light directly.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.220]   So the idea that the pineal is the third eye in humans
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.740]   is not true.
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.580]   It just isn't true.
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.260]   So anytime someone says, "Oh, the pineal is your third eye,"
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.360]   that's not the third eye center
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.420]   that people are referring to when they talk about meditation.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:32.520]   Now, you'll see a number of different forms of art
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.680]   where somebody will, it will be a picture of a face
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.760]   and the eyes will be closed,
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.580]   or sometimes open, there'll be literally a third eye,
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.520]   like a cyclops eye in the middle of the forehead.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.780]   That has been proposed for many thousands of years
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:47.980]   to be "the seat of our consciousness."
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:51.280]   Now, that's interesting because that real estate
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.920]   behind the forehead actually turns out
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.120]   to be the prefrontal cortex,
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.200]   which we know from lesion studies and stimulation studies.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.760]   If you remove that brain area,
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.920]   people become very reflexive.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.520]   They are not thinking intentionally.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.660]   They don't become deliberate.
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.660]   In fact, and this is kind of an eerie result,
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:12.660]   but if you inactivate, you turn off the prefrontal cortex
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.380]   and you give somebody the opportunity
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.920]   to play a shooting game, for instance,
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.520]   their accuracy goes through the roof.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.920]   They become essentially like a machine.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.160]   They see a stimulus, they shoot out.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.780]   They see a stimulus, they shoot at it.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.620]   Their accuracy is exceptional,
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.620]   but their ability to distinguish between enemy and friend
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.120]   completely disappears.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.200]   So they become a highly effective motor,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.160]   or I should say sensory motor machine,
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.680]   but their assessment and their judgment
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.020]   about right or wrong completely disappears.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.720]   This is also true for people that have prefrontal damage.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.920]   They often will have inappropriate behavior
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.400]   or a hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.840]   So the third eye center as the seat of consciousness
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.240]   and our intention is something that makes sense generally
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.720]   with what we know about the neuroscience and neurology,
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.000]   but there's something more to it
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.200]   that I think is especially important for all of you
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.560]   that goes beyond anything about ancient traditions
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.160]   or pineals or birds or snakes
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.960]   and pits in the top of the head, and here's what it is.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.420]   The brain itself, meaning the brain tissue,
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:21.400]   does not have any sensory neurons.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.280]   What do I mean by that?
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.560]   Well, if I touch the top of my hand, I can feel that.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.480]   If I want to sense my heartbeat,
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.000]   if I work at it, I can feel that.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.960]   If I want to sense how I feel internally
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.260]   at the level of my stomach, is it full, is it empty,
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.320]   am I hungry, is it acidic, does it ache,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.680]   or does it feel pleasant, et cetera, I can sense that.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.160]   And that's because we have sensory neurons on our skin
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.280]   and in our body, et cetera.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.680]   We also have sensory neurons in our eyes
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.560]   that let us perceive things externally.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.180]   We have no sensory neurons on our brain.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:54.160]   This is one of the reasons why you can remove the skull
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.480]   and do brain surgery on somebody who's wide awake
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.500]   and be poking around in there,
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.200]   and they don't need any anesthetic on the brain itself.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.920]   They need anesthetic for the incision site,
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.400]   but they don't need anesthetic on the brain
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.720]   because it has no feeling.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.360]   You have emotions, but there's no feeling.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.180]   So normally we are perceiving and paying attention
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:16.140]   to what we are sensing, either externally, sights and sounds,
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.120]   again, exteroception, or internally,
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.700]   interoception, touch, et cetera.
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.060]   But by focusing our perception and our attention,
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.280]   not on our bodily surface, like a body scan,
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.800]   but to a point a couple centimeters
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.360]   or inches behind our forehead,
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.720]   we essentially are bringing that attentional,
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.120]   that perceptual spotlight,
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.160]   to a location in which there is no sensation.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   There's nothing to feel there.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.040]   And when we do that, by closing our eyes
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.560]   and focusing on that "third eye center,"
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.320]   which is the prefrontal cortex, to be quite honest,
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.200]   when we do that, something else happens.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.460]   And what happens is when we are not thinking about
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.760]   and perceiving our sensations, because there are none there,
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.820]   our thoughts and our emotions and our memories
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.500]   sort of mushroom up.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.380]   A better way to put it would be that they geyser up
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.840]   and take on more prominence in our perception.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.400]   What I mean by this is that normally,
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.040]   I'm not thinking about the contact point
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.780]   between me and this chair,
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.720]   but as I'm speaking, I'm in contact with the chair
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.480]   and those neurons are firing.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.500]   But if I focus my energy and attention on them,
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.760]   they're going to fire the same,
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.440]   but more of my perception goes there.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.360]   Similarly, I'm thinking things all the time, you are too,
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.000]   and I'm perceiving things all the time,
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.420]   and I'm remembering things all the time,
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.240]   and I'm anticipating things all the time about the future.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:42.760]   But by focusing my attention on the one organ
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.520]   for which I have no sensation, that is my brain,
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.100]   well then, thoughts, feelings, and memories,
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.740]   feelings meaning emotional feelings,
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:58.060]   start to grow in their prominence,
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.320]   in my awareness and in my perception.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.640]   And so this is why,
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.600]   when you sit down to a meditative practice,
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.620]   if it's a meditative practice where you close your eyes
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.680]   or you're focused on that third eye center,
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.500]   where you're focused on your brain,
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.960]   as opposed to your bodily surface
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.900]   or something external to you,
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.880]   the thoughts seem to come by in waves,
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.240]   and they can almost be overwhelming.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.400]   It's very hard to, as it's often described,
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.160]   just sit back and watch your thoughts go by
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.840]   because there are so many of them.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.380]   Actually, the best way to stop thinking
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.660]   is to really focus on something external
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:31.840]   or to focus on sensation.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.040]   That's less thinking than it is perceiving senses, okay?
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.380]   So I don't want this to get too abstract.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.860]   When people talk about the third eye center,
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.080]   they're not talking about the pineal,
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.400]   they're talking about prefrontal cortex.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.360]   And when you direct your own attention
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.280]   to the very area of your brain that directs attention,
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.460]   there's nothing to sense there.
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.200]   The only things that will become present to you
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.200]   are feelings, emotions, that is, thoughts, and memories.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.340]   And they will often arrive
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.740]   in what seems to be a very disorganized fashion.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:06.760]   And the reason they arrive in somewhat disorganized fashion
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.520]   is because normally we just don't perceive things that way.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.820]   Normally we are splitting our attention,
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.240]   our perception, that is,
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.420]   to multiple things, our sensation and our thoughts.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.080]   When we put all of our perception into our thoughts,
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.320]   we see how disorganized, how wandering they are,
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.480]   and how, in fact, how random and intrusive those can be.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:29.360]   Again, random and intrusive.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.020]   And much of what we talked about in that paper earlier,
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.280]   the one where they asked people,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.580]   "What are you doing and what are you feeling
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.640]   and how happy or how unhappy you are?"
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.300]   What they discovered was that most people
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.120]   are sort of in their head a lot.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.480]   They're not really present to what they're doing,
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.920]   which leads me to the statement that I believe,
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.360]   at least based on the data, that paper included,
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.680]   that most people have an interoceptive bias.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.960]   They're focused more on what's going on internally
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.560]   than they are focused on what's happening externally.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.120]   There are certainly people who, for the opposite, is true,
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.720]   but I think that this is an issue
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.720]   because we hear so often about the need
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.600]   to do a meditation practice that allows us to focus inward
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.840]   and that we're getting yanked around
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.040]   by all the stressors of life, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.480]   And we are, we're getting yanked around
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.660]   by all the stressors and demands of life.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.340]   But as we do that, we tend to be very focused
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.900]   on what's happening with us.
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.880]   The data clearly point to the fact
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.160]   that being mindful and being aware
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.000]   can enhance one's level of presence and happiness,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.880]   but we can go so far as to say
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.040]   that being mindful and aware of what's happening,
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.360]   not just with us, but external to us
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.440]   in our immediate environment,
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.760]   that includes what other people are saying and doing,
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.100]   that also can really enhance
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.720]   our sense of wellbeing and happiness.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.460]   At least that's what the data point to.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.240]   Let's briefly recap where we've been so far.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.760]   We've talked a little bit about the brain networks
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.680]   that are activated during meditation,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:57.280]   which include prefrontal cortex, ACC, the insula.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.440]   We also talked about the difference
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.040]   between interoception and exteroception
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.400]   and the importance of assessing
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.760]   where you are along that continuum.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.960]   And I should mention, of course,
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.640]   that you can be right in the middle of that continuum.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.140]   You might sit down to do meditation
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.440]   and find that you are smack dab in the middle
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.040]   of being able to attend to things outside of you,
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.880]   but also attending to things inside of you,
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.880]   in which case I suggest doing a meditation
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.400]   that is either exteroceptive biased or interoceptive biased.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.240]   But as I mentioned earlier,
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.240]   if you find that you are more, quote unquote,
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.840]   in your head or in your body,
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.520]   well then focus on an exteroceptive biased meditation
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.960]   to build up that set of circuits,
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.600]   whereas if you are more exteroceptively focused
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.680]   at any given moment, well then I encourage you
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.880]   to do an interoceptively focused meditation practice.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.500]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.120]   there's this issue of how long to do a practice.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.640]   There are a lot of different data on these,
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.900]   but some of the practices we've covered on this podcast
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.800]   before when we had guests, for instance,
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.160]   highlighted the 13-minute meditation
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.480]   that Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University's laboratory
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.760]   has popularized, and they popularized it
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.080]   because they have a wonderful paper
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.760]   that we will provide a link to,
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.220]   which shows that a daily 13-minute meditation,
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.320]   which is of the traditional third eye,
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.640]   interoceptively biased, focused on breathing
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.040]   and focused on that location
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.060]   directly behind one's forehead or both,
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:19.980]   that meditation done daily for about eight weeks,
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.720]   maybe shorter, but in that study, eight weeks,
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.500]   greatly improved mood, improved ability to sleep,
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.160]   improved cognitive ability and focus, memory.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.720]   A huge number of metrics were looked at very specifically.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.780]   So that's a terrific one, and you may be asking yourself,
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.420]   do you need to do the full 13 minutes?
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:37.340]   Could you get away with five minutes or three minutes?
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.420]   Well, my laboratory has shown benefits
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.040]   in stress reduction, improvement in sleep, et cetera
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.080]   with a five-minute-a-day meditation.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.100]   However, in trying to establish how long you should meditate,
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.720]   I would ask yourself a couple of questions.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.440]   First of all, what is a practice
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.120]   that you can do consistently?
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.720]   And by consistently, that doesn't necessarily mean every day.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.380]   If you answer the question about consistency honestly,
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.000]   and you find that you can only do
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.020]   one meditation session per week,
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.020]   well, then I would encourage you to go a little bit longer,
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:08.480]   maybe 10 or 15 minutes, maybe even 30 minutes.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.880]   Again, understanding that you're going to have
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.820]   to refocus repeatedly throughout that meditation,
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.220]   regardless of whether or not you're focusing
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.160]   on internal perceptions or external perceptions.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.160]   If, however, you can set aside five or 10
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.560]   or 15 minutes per day, and you can meditate every day,
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.300]   well, then I think you have a bit more flexibility
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.560]   in terms of how long you meditate.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.240]   Maybe it's three minutes one day, one minute the next day,
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.480]   10 minutes the next, and so on and so forth.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.940]   Just like with exercise, the key component is consistency.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.540]   And this is borne out in all the data
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.540]   that's covered in "Altered Traits."
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:42.040]   It's also borne out in all the recent studies
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:42.880]   that have come out.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.500]   Since that book was published, consistency is key.
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.860]   So ask yourself what you can do consistently,
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.740]   and also don't necessarily burden yourself
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:53.000]   with always having to do the same amount
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.560]   or duration of meditation.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.100]   So earlier, we decided we were going to parse
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.600]   or fine slice the meditation practice.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.000]   And indeed, we've been doing that.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.700]   We've talked about interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias,
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.200]   and we've been talking about
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.240]   where you place your perception or your focus.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.880]   Another key component of meditation
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.340]   is the pattern of breathing that you embrace.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:17.040]   In fact, the pattern of breathing that you embrace
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.740]   during your meditation practice
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:22.520]   can itself be its own form of meditation.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.600]   What do I mean by that?
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.340]   Well, these days, we hear a lot about breath work.
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.480]   Breath work has really grown in popularity
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.980]   in the last five, 10 years,
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.540]   and there are a number of reasons for that.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.480]   First of all, I think we need to credit Wim Hof,
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.240]   or can we call him, I think appropriately,
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.700]   the great Wim Hof.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.360]   Certainly, there were people before Wim
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.720]   who were doing deliberate breath work
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.560]   and talking about deliberate breath work,
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:46.160]   but it was really about 2015 or so
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.360]   that Wim Hof started to grow in recognition and popularity
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.200]   for a particular style of breathing,
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.340]   which in the laboratory we call cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.820]   I know there are other names for it
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.420]   that come from ancient traditions.
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:02.520]   He named it, or people named it after him, Wim Hof.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.640]   Wim Hof, for those of you that don't know,
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.400]   is a Dutchman who is known to hold many world records
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.280]   for deliberate cold exposure,
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.860]   including swimming under icebergs,
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.800]   longest period of time,
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.020]   buried in ice up to his neck, et cetera,
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.560]   but who's also expert in the use of breathing
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.520]   in particular ways in order to manage
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.720]   and maneuver through those challenges.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.840]   And he started speaking
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.480]   about different patterns of breath work, in particular,
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.880]   the use of cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.540]   deep, deliberate breathing, so big inhales, exhales,
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:37.140]   big inhales, exhales.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.020]   In the laboratory, again,
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.540]   we call that cyclic hyperventilation.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.280]   It's very clear from studies both done on Wim specifically,
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.960]   but on the general population as well,
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.500]   by my lab and other labs,
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.640]   that that pattern of cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.480]   of deliberately breathing deeply and repetitively,
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.020]   typically in through the nose, out through the mouth,
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.440]   generates a lot of adrenaline
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.520]   or causes adrenaline release from the brain and body.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.200]   It, quote unquote, heats up the body.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.040]   Indeed, it raises body temperature,
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.580]   but the liberation of adrenaline does a number of things
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:08.520]   to shift the state of the brain and body.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.900]   That more or less is what Wim Hof breathing is,
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.260]   although Wim Hof breathing,
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.240]   or some people will call it Tummo breathing
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.120]   or cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.500]   is not a pattern of breathing typical of most meditations
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.360]   that have been discussed,
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.320]   at least not in the research literature.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.640]   Now, that's not to say that cyclic hyperventilation
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.200]   can't be incorporated into a meditation practice,
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.640]   but Wim Hof breathing,
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.080]   AKA cyclic hyperventilation Tummo,
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.600]   is typically considered its own practice, okay?
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.860]   Its own breath work practice divorced from meditation.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.320]   It might have a meditative component,
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.880]   but it's not often discussed as meditation
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.560]   or as part of meditation.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.020]   More typically, a meditation practice
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.400]   involves slowing one's breathing,
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.520]   and this could be in the form of cyclic breathing
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:56.120]   of inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, which is cyclic,
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.620]   or in some cases, doubling up on inhales and then exhaling.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:02.340]   So inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale, exhale,
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:06.180]   or controlling the duration of inhale, breath, hold,
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:09.480]   exhale, breath, hold, repeat, so-called box breathing,
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.960]   where the inhale, the hold, the exhale, and the hold
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.520]   are of equivalent durations.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.680]   Any number of different breathing patterns,
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:20.200]   slow cyclic breathing, box breathing,
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.240]   a cadence of three to six seconds in,
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.740]   holding for two seconds, and seven seconds out.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.300]   Regardless of what cadence of breathing one uses,
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.820]   there is a tendency during most meditative practices
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:36.640]   to slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.440]   in deliberate fashion.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.260]   This is essential because when we default our breathing,
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:44.840]   that is, when we don't pay attention
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.800]   to how long we are inhaling relative to our exhales,
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.080]   when we don't deliberately exhale,
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.340]   that is, normally we just passively exhale,
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:55.600]   but we actively inhale.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.440]   I repeat that.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.720]   Normally, when we're not thinking about breathing,
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.640]   we deliberately inhale.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.680]   There's a motor command that's sent to inflate the lungs,
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.160]   and then we passively exhale,
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.360]   but in many breath work practices or meditation practices,
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.800]   we actually actively exhale as well.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.000]   Well, when we do that, a number of things happen.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.880]   First of all, it forces us into interoception.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.720]   Why?
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.320]   Because it's the diaphragm, the muscle that helps
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.040]   move the lungs, essentially,
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:27.040]   and create a specific cadence of breathing
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:30.560]   or depth of breathing, as one would with box breathing
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.440]   or deliberately slow breathing.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.840]   Well, that muscle resides inside of us,
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.580]   and so when we focus on our breathing,
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.520]   more often than not, we aren't focused on the actual air
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.400]   leaving our nasal passages or mouth, maybe a little bit,
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.980]   but more typically, we are forced to focus,
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.520]   or we just default to focusing on the movement
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.280]   of our diaphragm or of our belly
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:52.280]   or the rising and falling of our chest.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:56.660]   All of that is to say that by deliberately focusing
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:01.020]   on our breathing, we shift to interoception.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.240]   So breathing and specific patterns of breathing
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.120]   sort of along for the ride in meditation,
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.120]   but the reverse can also be said
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.000]   that when we focus on our breathing,
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.940]   we shift to interoception and away from external events.
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.800]   Doesn't mean we can't still pay attention to external events.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.000]   We can still exterocept, but at least some portion
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.520]   of our perception of our attention shifts to interoception.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.160]   So we, of course, need to breathe to stay alive.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.420]   We have to breathe at least every so often
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.420]   in order to stay alive.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:36.660]   So of course, breathing is part of any meditative practice,
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:40.840]   just like it's part of any living activity, even sleep,
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.080]   but if the first component of meditation
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.820]   is to direct our perception in a deliberate way,
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.320]   using that prefrontal cortex to a specific location,
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.640]   either on the surface of or within our body
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.100]   or external to our body or both,
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.720]   but typically one or the other,
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.380]   then we can say that the second element
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:04.860]   of a meditative practice is the pattern of breathing.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:07.080]   And we can ask ourselves,
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.240]   can it and should it be deliberate or not?
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.600]   In other words, we just default
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.280]   to however we happen to be breathing,
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.360]   or should it be deliberate?
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.300]   That is, should we be controlling the depth and the cadence?
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.900]   And I do believe that based on what we know
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:23.520]   about the capacity for specific patterns of breathing
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.980]   to shift our brain state,
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.480]   that controlling one's pattern of breathing
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.960]   during meditation can be enormously useful.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.280]   And that is true regardless of whether or not
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.280]   one is focusing on interoceptive perceptions
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:41.680]   within our body or exteroceptive perceptions.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:42.720]   So that raises the question,
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.800]   how should we breathe during meditation?
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:49.800]   Well, there's again, no simple one size fits all rule there,
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.600]   but there are some general rules of respiration physiology
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.200]   that can help us access and develop a meditation practice
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.580]   that is going to best serve our goals.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:03.000]   And since this is not an episode all about respiration,
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.140]   and we will do one,
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.880]   but I simply want to give you the basics
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.360]   of what respiration can do
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.500]   to shift your brain and body state.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.920]   Before I do that, however,
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.000]   I want to give a very specific instruction,
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.200]   which is when you sit down to meditate,
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.560]   or if you're going to do your meditation walking,
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.800]   that's fine too, I should just say,
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.280]   when you are about to begin your meditative practice,
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.080]   you need to ask yourself a question.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:33.320]   Do you want to be more relaxed than you are at present?
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.480]   Or do you want to be more alert than you are at present
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:39.040]   when you exit the meditation practice?
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.480]   Do you want to calm down?
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.220]   Or do you want to become more alert?
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:46.480]   Simple question, you can decide from session to session,
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.280]   you could even switch within a session,
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.180]   but just as you need to assess whether or not
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:54.620]   you are leaning more interceptively or exteroceptively,
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:56.500]   you also need to ask yourself,
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.420]   do you need to calm down or want to calm down?
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.820]   Or do you want to be more alert
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.680]   at the end of your meditation session?
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.900]   Or maybe you want to go into a state of deep relaxation
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:06.640]   and then exit with more alertness.
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.620]   The way to do that is very simple,
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:12.080]   using breath work and specific patterns of breathing.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.060]   And here is the general rule that is supported
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:18.740]   by all the respiration physiology that I'm aware of.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:19.940]   I'm oversimplifying here,
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:22.220]   but I'm oversimplifying intentionally
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.840]   so you can simply apply the tool.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.180]   And then, as I mentioned before,
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.060]   we will do an episode all about respiration physiology
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.900]   in the future.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:35.080]   Essentially, if your inhales are longer
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.540]   and/or more vigorous than your exhales,
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.740]   then you will tend to be more alert,
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:43.020]   where you will shift your brain and body
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.540]   towards a state of more alertness.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.880]   This is simply based on the way that the neural circuits,
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.180]   like the pre-Botzinger nucleus and the parafacial nucleus,
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:53.140]   they govern respiration physiology and alertness.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:54.200]   It's simply the way they work.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.440]   They communicate with brain areas
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:58.300]   that release noradrenaline, norepinephrine, et cetera.
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:05.120]   In contrast, if you emphasize longer duration
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:10.220]   and/or more vigorous exhales relative to your inhales,
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:12.420]   you will tend to relax more.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.840]   You will tend to calm your nervous system.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.820]   Now, you might be saying, okay, I understand what it is
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.440]   to make an inhale longer than my exhale,
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.080]   but how do I make it more vigorous?
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.900]   Well, it simply means drawing more air
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:24.840]   into your lungs more quickly
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.540]   than you allow yourself to exhale that air.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:32.360]   So an example of inhale-biased breath work would be,
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.800]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.800]   so there's an active emphasis on the inhale,
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.680]   and it's a little bit longer than the exhale,
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:41.760]   which is passive.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.460]   Conversely, if you want to relax,
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:48.240]   then you want to extend your exhales relative to your inhales
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.500]   and you can even make them active exhales.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.920]   So it can be inhale,
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.300]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.140]   exhale.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.780]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.700]   That's going to shift your nervous system
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:02.660]   in a direction of more calm.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.940]   And of course, if you would like to stay
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:08.300]   at the level of alertness, aka calmness,
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.540]   because those are two sides of the same seesaw
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:11.860]   or the same continuum,
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.860]   if you'd like to be right where you're at
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.340]   at the end of your meditation as where you started,
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.860]   at least in terms of levels of alertness and calmness,
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:21.980]   well, then you would just keep your inhales and your exhales
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.760]   relatively balanced in terms of duration.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.680]   Now, the introduction of things like breath holds
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.340]   with box breathing or Wim Hof breathing
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:33.060]   typically it's 25 or 30 deep inhale exhales,
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:35.740]   deep inhale exhales, and then exhale all your air,
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:38.620]   hold your breath for 15 to 60 seconds and then repeat
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.220]   and so on, sometimes some inhales and holds.
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:43.540]   Well, that's a whole business into itself,
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:46.040]   but for sake of meditation,
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.580]   the key thing to understand is that
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:51.660]   if you are going to do a complicated breathing practice,
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:54.620]   it will by design, by necessity,
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:57.860]   shift much of your attention to the breathing practice,
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:59.140]   especially if it's not cyclic,
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.020]   if it's not inhales, follow exhales.
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:03.380]   Cyclic breathing is where inhales always follow exhales,
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.620]   follow inhales, follow exhales.
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:06.940]   It actually relies on a specific brain center
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:08.260]   called the Prebot-Singer complex
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:10.020]   discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:12.160]   He was a guest on this podcast previously.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.660]   However, if you are doubling up on your inhale,
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:18.180]   so two inhales and then an exhale,
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:22.940]   a pattern of breathing my laboratory has studied extensively,
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:25.060]   well, then that relies on a different brain center,
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:26.140]   the parafacial nucleus.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.980]   The point is that if you are engaging
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.780]   in non-cyclic breathing
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:35.300]   or you are deliberately emphasizing inhales or exhales
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:38.300]   or the vigor of inhales and exhales, et cetera,
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:41.620]   well, then some portion of your attention will be devoted
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.960]   to making sure that you follow that breathing practice.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:47.420]   We are very good at going into cyclic breathing practices
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:50.500]   by default and our attention can drift to other things,
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:53.820]   interoceptive or exteroceptive, doesn't matter.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:56.440]   We can just drift into how our body feels
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.320]   or something we see or hear in the room, et cetera.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.780]   When we are focused on our breathing
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:04.060]   and the breathing pattern is non-cyclic or complex
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:07.060]   in some way in that it involves
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:09.260]   deliberate voluntary commands,
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:12.240]   again, from those so-called top-down mechanisms
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.640]   of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:18.580]   well, that by design requires some portion,
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:20.660]   often a significant portion of our attention
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:23.540]   to be devoted to the breathing practice itself.
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.380]   So what does this mean?
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.460]   This means that breath work itself
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:28.260]   can be a form of meditation
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:31.820]   and meditation can involve breath work,
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:35.660]   but one should know that the more deliberate
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:40.140]   and unnatural that pattern of breathing is,
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:43.220]   the less you will be able to focus on other things.
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:44.900]   Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:46.020]   You can actually leverage this.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.860]   So for instance, if you're somebody who's very much caught
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:51.300]   in your own head, right, we talked about this earlier,
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:52.780]   you happen to be, or you're in a moment
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:53.820]   where you're really stuck in your head
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:55.300]   and you want to get out of your head,
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.980]   well, then that meditation practice that you do
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:59.320]   really should be focused on exteroceptive bias.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320]   You should really focus on something external to you.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.540]   And I would encourage you to use
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:05.440]   a natural cyclic pattern of breathing
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.820]   where inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:12.020]   If, however, you are finding that you're sort of caught
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.340]   in the landscape of things happening around you
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:17.020]   and you want to ground yourself as it's sometimes called,
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.320]   that's a loose language, not a scientific language.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.900]   I know there's this practice of grounding
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.580]   and that's a whole thing people always writing to me
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.320]   is grounding a real thing, walking barefoot on the earth
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.340]   and magnetic fields and gravitational fields.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.740]   Gravity is real, but grounding,
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.420]   there isn't a lot of science for it, to be frank.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:35.720]   Does feel nice to walk on the ground, however.
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:39.700]   But if you are somebody who's kind of feeling pulled out
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.420]   of yourself a lot or in a moment
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:44.860]   and you want to bring your awareness into your body
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:48.200]   and sort of calm down, well, then I would encourage you
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.300]   to, yes, use a deliberate, somewhat unnatural
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:55.560]   or non-default pattern of breathing,
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.880]   which by definition will force you to attend
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.840]   to what's going on interoceptively.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.220]   Again, I'm not aware of any place
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:05.960]   that this has been discussed in detail such as this before.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.560]   If there is a research literature on this,
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:09.400]   please let me know.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.140]   My laboratory has been working on this extensively.
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:13.720]   I'm always looking for new colleagues and collaborators.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.220]   We, we meaning Dr. David Spiegel,
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:17.760]   who's an expert in hypnosis, again,
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.140]   who's been a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:22.860]   and my colleague at Stanford Psychiatry.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:24.700]   In fact, he's our associate chair of psychiatry,
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:25.860]   world expert in hypnosis.
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.140]   He's been on this podcast before.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:30.820]   We have an active research program focused on these issues.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.140]   We are very much of the belief
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.400]   that a breath work practice itself can be meditative.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.420]   A meditation practice can include breathing,
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:40.740]   but the more that that meditative practice
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:42.580]   focuses on the breathing itself,
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:45.200]   the more interoceptive biased it will be.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.940]   Now, it's very important to understand
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:51.140]   that an interoceptive biased breath work practice
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.120]   will have a specific effect,
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.060]   which is to make you more interoceptively aware.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.500]   And if you think back to earlier in the episode,
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.740]   for many people, that will be a wonderful thing
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.340]   and something that they are actively seeking
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:06.940]   or ought to seek because it can help people gain awareness.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:09.240]   For instance, if they're stressed
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.960]   and they're not realizing it till the end of the day,
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.220]   they're just exhausted,
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.080]   more interoceptive awareness throughout the day
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.060]   can be very beneficial.
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:19.220]   If, however, you are somebody who is overly focused
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.740]   on your bodily sensations,
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.460]   well, then more exteroceptive awareness is important.
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:26.220]   And this brings us to a yet larger theme,
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:29.120]   but a theme that I think really emphasizes
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.300]   what particular types of meditative practices
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.620]   are going to be best for certain people,
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:36.000]   especially people who are using meditation
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.720]   to combat certain challenges,
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.500]   in particular, mood-based challenges
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:43.140]   or sleep-based challenges or focus-based challenges.
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:47.700]   I haven't listed off all the positive benefits of meditation
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.820]   yet in this episode, but they are many, many, many.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.200]   In fact, there are now tens of thousands
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.860]   of scientific studies showing, for instance,
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:59.820]   there are known benefits of doing meditation
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.320]   for enhancing sleep.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.600]   There are known benefits of a regular meditation practice
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.900]   for enhancing focus.
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.280]   There are known benefits of a regular meditation practice
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.940]   for reducing inflammatory cytokines,
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:13.420]   even improving outcomes in cancer, reducing pain,
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.060]   improving mood, reducing the symptoms of ADHD
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:19.980]   and clinically diagnosed ADHD and on and on and on.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.980]   And again, rather than focus
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.180]   on all those beautiful studies today,
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.600]   which all basically point to the fact
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.760]   that some meditation practice done regularly,
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.880]   even if it's very brief,
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.760]   has tremendous, even outsized benefits on our health,
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.160]   even relative to some drug treatments that's been shown,
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.420]   rather than focus on all that,
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:40.180]   I've been more focused on what sorts of brain
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:42.660]   and body changes occur when we do a meditation practice,
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.800]   and perhaps more importantly,
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:46.620]   what really constitutes a meditation practice.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:49.660]   We have this thing about a continuum of perception.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.540]   We also now are talking about breathing.
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.620]   Well, there's another component that I'd like to raise now,
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.460]   which we could say is the third major component.
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:59.100]   The first one that I raised was interoceptive
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:02.340]   versus extroceptive bias or continuum.
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.140]   Second being breathing.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:07.100]   Is it going to be default or deliberate breathing?
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.700]   Is it going to be natural cadence or unnatural cadence?
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:12.040]   Again, no right or wrong.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.920]   It just depends on what your goal is.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.940]   There's a third component.
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:17.340]   And this is a component, again,
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.260]   that hasn't really been formalized in the literature,
[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:22.260]   but that Dr. Spiegel and I are working hard to formalize
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:25.660]   through some research and through an upcoming review
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.500]   that we will provide links to once it's out.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.680]   And that's a separate continuum,
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.700]   which is the continuum
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:35.140]   between interoception and dissociation.
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:37.960]   So now all of you know what interoception is,
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.060]   but most people probably don't know
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.780]   or don't realize what dissociation is.
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:45.120]   Often we hear about dissociation,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.220]   sometimes called disassociation.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.460]   Some people pronounce it dissociation.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:50.960]   Guess what?
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.460]   Despite being corrected many times
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.980]   for each of those pronunciations,
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:56.140]   I checked with my colleagues who are experts
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.240]   in dissociation or disassociation, and guess what?
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.180]   They're the same thing.
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.740]   Tomato, tomato, potato, potato.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:05.660]   So I'm going to say dissociation.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:09.480]   Some people will say disassociation, like I disassociate.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.300]   Other people will say I dissociate, okay?
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.540]   Both of those refer to essentially the same thing.
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:19.180]   Dissociation is often talked about
[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:21.240]   in the context of a negative event.
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.440]   And indeed dissociation is unfortunately,
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.220]   or I should say is adaptively associated
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:29.860]   with traumatic events.
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:32.000]   In particular, violent or sexual trauma,
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000]   people report feeling out of body or out of the experience,
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.220]   during the experience
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.320]   or during a recollection of the experience.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.580]   Dissociation has also been described
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:46.940]   in terms of people who are in a traumatic accident
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:49.220]   or they see someone killed right in front of them.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:51.240]   First responders will talk about dissociating
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.440]   when they arrive on a scene.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.360]   I don't want to provide gruesome imagery here
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:55.980]   'cause I know people can be pretty sensitive to this,
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:59.540]   but showing up on the scene of a car crash
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:04.240]   and just seeing carnage or incredible damage to bodies
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.000]   or this sort of thing.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.040]   Dissociation lies at the opposite end of a continuum
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:10.520]   with interoception.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.440]   Now, earlier I said the interoception
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:15.220]   is on the opposite end of a continuum with exteroception,
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.880]   but it also is on the opposite end of a continuum
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:20.100]   with dissociation.
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.400]   We can provide some better definitions perhaps
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.020]   to make this crystal clear.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:26.540]   And here I'm actually reading from an upcoming review.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:27.640]   I feel comfortable reading from it
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.080]   because I'm an author on the review,
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.900]   but nonetheless, interoception refers to a process
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:33.180]   by which your nervous system,
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.840]   meaning your brain and connections with your body,
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:37.860]   senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates signals
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.500]   originating from within the body
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.800]   and thereby provides moment-to-moment mapping
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.480]   of your internal landscape
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.440]   at both a conscious and unconscious level.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:49.000]   Okay, that's a lot of words to describe
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.040]   basically the process of perceiving what's happening
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:54.100]   at the level of the surface of your skin or inward.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.280]   Dissociation can be thought of
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.460]   as the opposite of interoception.
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:02.240]   It's a lack of bodily awareness
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.000]   or a removal of one's conscious experience
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.320]   from one's bodily experience and awareness.
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:11.200]   Again, this is most often talked about
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.200]   in the context of something traumatic,
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.720]   but really, if we think about health and mental health
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.040]   and physical health,
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:20.720]   the optimal place to reside on the continuum
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.760]   between interoception and dissociation
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.900]   is somewhere in the middle.
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.700]   We don't want to be dissociated from life's experiences,
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:30.460]   but we also don't want everything that happens in the world
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:33.060]   to profoundly impact our heart rate and our breathing.
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:35.880]   We'd be yanked around by every experience.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.760]   Okay, there are instances in which being yanked around
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.280]   or pulled into an experience
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.640]   is something that we desire and want,
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.000]   like seeing a movie that we want to see,
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.400]   or for instance, clinical hypnosis,
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.500]   or falling in love, wonderful experiences,
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.660]   and sometimes also sad experiences, right?
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:55.000]   Being able to feel one's feelings
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.060]   depending on life's events is important,
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:02.240]   but being too dissociated or being too feeling,
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:04.980]   that is feeling so much in response
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:07.680]   to everything that happens is also problematic.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.980]   There are certain people, for instance,
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:13.060]   that have challenges with what's called narrative distancing.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:15.120]   That is, they see someone in a movie getting hit
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.280]   and they almost flinch as if they are getting hit.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.820]   They see someone who's scared or happy in a movie
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:23.640]   and they feel scared or happy in a way
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.080]   that seems like they're along for the ride
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.140]   a little bit too much.
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.480]   This is important because what it speaks to
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.160]   is the ability for that,
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.040]   remember way back at the beginning of the episode,
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.240]   that ACC, that anterior cingulate cortex and the insula?
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.840]   We've got a prefrontal cortex that can say,
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:42.360]   "Hey, let's be rational."
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.080]   That movie, that person who's happy or sad,
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.400]   that person in your environment who's breaking down crying,
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.820]   yes, they're sad, it's important to be sympathetic,
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:52.920]   maybe even empathic towards them,
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.880]   but let's not get pulled into the experience
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.680]   so much that we lose ourselves.
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.520]   And then, of course, there are areas of your brain
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.160]   that are also leaning on, and here I'm using metaphor,
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.640]   but they're leaning on the insula and ACC and saying,
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.020]   "Hey, there's somebody that I care about that's upset.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:11.160]   I'm also going to be upset."
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.400]   Or, "Somebody I care about is happy.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.700]   I'm also going to be happy."
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.300]   Or, "They're scared, so I'm also going to be scared."
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.480]   So it's a push-pull between our recognition
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.700]   that we are each distinct entities
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:23.120]   and also, of course, the very healthy desire
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.380]   to be attached to others' experiences
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:27.160]   and the experiences around us.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.980]   So why am I raising yet another continuum, right?
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:31.900]   We already have the one continuum
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:35.400]   of interoceptive/extroceptive awareness.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.540]   Well, if we want to think about how meditation
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:42.700]   can serve our mental health and our ability to focus,
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:47.980]   there's a very particular mental model that we can arrive at
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:52.340]   that incorporates this interoceptive/dissociative continuum.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:54.660]   Again, if you are extremely interoceptive,
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:57.780]   you're feeling everything in your body,
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.300]   and those feelings in your body nearly completely account
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:01.380]   for all of your experience
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:03.460]   if you're that far into the continuum.
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.700]   On the dissociative end of things,
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.540]   you can see what's going on,
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.660]   you can react to what's going on,
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:13.220]   but your bodily response to that is essentially shut down.
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:15.040]   You could either be paralyzed, shut down,
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.060]   so in kind of no movement,
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:20.060]   or you could still be engaging in behaviors,
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.620]   but you're dissociated.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:25.300]   Again, sadly, this is often what victims of trauma report,
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.100]   that they are able to just go through the motions
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.620]   but just shut off their emotions
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.440]   or their emotions just shut off.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:33.080]   They aren't feeling the elevated heart rate or breathing.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.740]   Sometimes they can even be quite scared,
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:37.020]   but they're not even perspiring
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.480]   or showing any signs of autonomic arousal,
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:43.280]   that is, fright or stress or panic.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.500]   So let's talk about this model
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:47.220]   of interoception and dissociation,
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.260]   and then a meditative practice that can be used
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.980]   to try and anchor us at the right location
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.220]   or the healthy location along that continuum.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:59.980]   Let's first imagine the ideal mental health state,
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:03.500]   and here I want to acknowledge nobody achieves
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.980]   or at least maintains this mental health state.
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:08.260]   Once you do imagine that where you are
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:10.940]   along this interoceptive to dissociative continuum
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.220]   is like a ball bearing,
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:16.140]   or you represent a sphere that can roll back and forth
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:17.220]   along the continuum.
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:19.260]   At one end, you have pure interoception.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.380]   You're just feeling everything.
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:22.620]   At the other end, you're completely dissociated.
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:25.940]   Well, in this one version of mental health,
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:29.220]   we take that continuum and we fold up the sides
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:31.820]   so that it looks like a V, okay?
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:34.020]   On one end, you have interoception.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.980]   On the other end, you have dissociation.
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:37.520]   I realize a number of people are listening to this,
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.740]   not watching this on YouTube,
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.140]   so they can't see that my hands are now,
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.540]   the heel of my hands are together,
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:46.180]   my fingers of my hands are apart, so it looks like a V,
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.800]   and you are like a ball bearing.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.180]   Your state is like a ball bearing at the base of that.
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:54.180]   You are in a trench of perfectly balanced interoception
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:56.420]   and dissociation, so you can feel things,
[01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:59.080]   you can register what's going on in the outside world,
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:02.580]   but your feelings are not overwhelmed or overtaken
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.000]   by what's happening in the outside world.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.180]   You are in a perfect place
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:06.980]   of being able to make rational decisions
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:09.500]   and yet still feel your feelings.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.940]   Wouldn't that be lovely?
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.380]   Wouldn't that be lovely if we could be like that
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:13.600]   whenever we wanted to?
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:16.060]   And frankly, nobody is like that all the time.
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:20.320]   More typically, the model of mental health
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.980]   and mood and wellbeing and perception
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:26.580]   of self versus others and internal versus external states
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:30.260]   is one of more of a U, a U shape,
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:32.180]   where at one end, we have interoception,
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:33.880]   and at the other end, we have dissociation,
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.340]   and it's kind of U-shaped,
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:39.900]   and your state is more or less like a ball bearing
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.100]   at the base of that U that can, you know,
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:43.500]   it gets pushed from side to side.
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.020]   Maybe your heart races a little bit
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.940]   because of something bad or good,
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:49.060]   and that ball bearing shifts
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.380]   towards interoception a little bit more,
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.420]   and you notice that your heart is racing.
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:56.160]   Or perhaps at any given moment, you know,
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.120]   your mind drifts a little bit while watching a movie
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:00.660]   or while talking to your partner
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:03.660]   or while your child is complaining about something
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.820]   and you're thinking about something else,
[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:05.740]   and that ball bearing shifts
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.860]   towards the dissociative state a little bit.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:10.580]   That is a mild form of dissociation.
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:11.740]   And I think most people would agree
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.500]   that being mentally healthy
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:16.300]   would involve this kind of U-shaped model as well,
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:18.480]   where it's kind of, can shift back and forth,
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.420]   but it's not extreme.
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:21.700]   You're not going from interoceptive biased
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:24.960]   all the way to dissociated in any kind of extreme way.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.560]   The ball bearing stays down near the base of that U.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:32.060]   Then, of course, there are states that we all, frankly,
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:33.860]   go into from time to time,
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:36.480]   where the continuum of interoception and dissociation
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:38.480]   is essentially flat,
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.420]   where you are a ball bearing at one location or another,
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:43.560]   depending on whether or not you're watching a movie
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.940]   that you're very engrossed in,
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:46.420]   or you're in a conversation with,
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.180]   or in an activity with your partner or a friend, et cetera,
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.140]   has you very engrossed, maybe matching their state, right?
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:53.280]   There are a number of states you can imagine
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:56.180]   where matching one state is actually healthy and good.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:58.000]   And then there are a number of conditions in life
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.700]   and situations in life where being matched
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:00.700]   to someone else's condition,
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.320]   like you're getting yelled at and they're angry,
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.340]   so then you're getting angry,
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:05.020]   and then pretty soon, you know,
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:08.460]   you're not in the best place along that continuum.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:09.940]   And I think that for many people,
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.640]   they find themselves somewhere along that continuum,
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.760]   and a number of practices, including meditation,
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.000]   including exercise, including getting a good night's sleep,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.200]   including therapy, including journaling,
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.760]   including just doing activities
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:26.380]   like social engagement that you enjoy,
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.780]   are designed to sort of bring up the edges
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:32.620]   of that flat continuum into more of a U or concave shape
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:37.540]   so that that ball bearing, meaning your state of awareness
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:39.540]   and your state of feeling your own feelings
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:41.940]   versus paying attention to what's going on around you,
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:44.700]   is somewhere, again, biased toward the middle
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:47.820]   by curling up the edges of that continuum on either end,
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:50.060]   it biases that state toward the middle.
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:53.160]   And then, of course, there's the extreme
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:55.060]   that I think almost everybody would agree
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.260]   is more or less pathologic,
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.880]   which is one in which that continuum
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:04.240]   is no longer shaped like a deep trench, like a V.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.880]   It's not shaped like a U.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:08.160]   It's not flat with the edges curled up a little bit
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.000]   or even flat.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.920]   It's actually now convex.
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:13.120]   It looks like a mountain shape, a peak.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:14.800]   And that little ball bearing at the top
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.560]   can either drop all the way to one side
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:21.880]   of pure interoception, just feeling beyond any ability
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:23.400]   to pay attention to anything else,
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.680]   just feeling one's feelings, being angry, being sad,
[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:31.560]   being, or even happy, being so extremely happy or manic
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.880]   that you can't pay attention to the fact
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.840]   that it's totally out of context,
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.400]   inappropriate for what's going on around you,
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:39.000]   or dropping to the other side of the continuum
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.740]   where you're so dissociated that you're not engaged
[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:42.580]   with what's going around you.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:45.080]   You're truly, quote, unquote, checked out.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:51.080]   That shape is one that I think almost all clinicians,
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.680]   if not all clinicians, and most people would say
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:57.940]   is pathologic because you are either completely checked out
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:02.460]   or you are completely absorbed in what's going on
[01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:05.300]   within you or around you.
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:08.240]   That mental model that I just created
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.500]   is a simple mental model.
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.560]   It is by no means exhaustive,
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.840]   but it does incorporate a lot of what we think about
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.680]   when we think about mental health
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:18.600]   and we talk about the ability to be mentally stable,
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   to feel one's feelings, but to still be actively engaged
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.080]   in what's happening around us.
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:25.420]   And again, it's a continuum that spans
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:28.600]   from interoceptive awareness to dissociation,
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.700]   where the extremes are pathologic
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:33.440]   and somewhere in the middle is healthier,
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.800]   and then there are practices that bias us
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.980]   toward being in the middle by default.
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:40.100]   What are those practices?
[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:44.100]   Well, we know for sure that being sleep-deprived,
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:49.100]   for instance, tends to take us away from that trench shape
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:52.440]   or U-shape continuum or even flat continuum
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.960]   and starts to make that continuum more convex.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.680]   It tends to make us either feel
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:59.320]   like we're completely checked out and exhausted
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.800]   or that we are completely labile.
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:04.960]   We are yanked around by whatever experience is happening.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.520]   We are just not able to manage.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.720]   So sleep is, as I always say,
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.400]   the fundamental or foundational layer of mental health,
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:12.640]   physical health, and performance
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:15.260]   because it tends to put us in a healthier place.
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.360]   That is, when we're getting enough quality sleep
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:19.120]   consistently, it tends to put us
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.940]   in the middle of that continuum.
[01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:23.360]   Sleep deprivation does exactly the opposite.
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.480]   It pulls us apart.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:26.640]   And when I say pulls us apart, that's not a real term.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:28.880]   What it does is it tends to make
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:31.660]   that continuum less concave, right?
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:36.540]   Less bowl-shaped and more convex, more hill-shaped,
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:39.340]   if not a peak mountain shape
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:41.480]   where it drops us to one side or the other.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:47.180]   In addition, a meditative practice done regularly
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.920]   because it can allow us to become
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:51.500]   more interoceptively aware,
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:55.420]   or it can allow us to become more exteroceptively aware,
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.900]   which is really just another form of dissociation.
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:01.200]   Again, dissociation isn't always bad,
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.980]   provided it's not at the extreme.
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:06.540]   A meditative practice can actually teach us
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:09.860]   to deliberately move along this continuum.
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:12.640]   So this is something, again,
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:15.180]   that hasn't been discussed a whole lot in the literature.
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:16.380]   It's been discussed, I should say,
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:18.460]   in pieces in different literatures.
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:21.200]   If you look in the clinical psychiatry literature,
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.840]   there's a wonderful collection of studies and reviews
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.740]   that will say that interoceptive awareness is terrific
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.980]   except for the person that is so aware
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:30.140]   of their internal functioning
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:32.340]   that they are not able to engage in the world.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:35.040]   Similarly, you'll find a beautiful literature,
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.260]   research and clinical literature,
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:39.540]   that will say that dissociation is terrible
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:40.940]   in the case of trauma.
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:42.620]   In fact, it can put people in positions
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.540]   of repeating a behavior over and over
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:46.360]   that's damaging to them,
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.140]   but because they can disengage or they're dissociated from it
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:52.380]   that they continue the behavior,
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:56.860]   or dissociation can be very adaptive and beneficial
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:58.600]   if it allows people, for instance,
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.980]   to create some narrative distancing
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:01.900]   so they're not getting pulled into every argument,
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.520]   or if someone screams at them,
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.940]   they don't necessarily think that it's their fault,
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.640]   they are able to say, "Hey, wait,"
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:09.440]   use their prefrontal cortex and say, "Hey, wait,
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:11.040]   "just because you're upset
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.960]   "does not mean that I did something wrong.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.540]   "Let's look at the evidence rationally."
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.020]   Okay, so in thinking about the positive effects
[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:21.960]   of meditation on mood,
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.860]   there are two aspects that are important.
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:25.260]   The first one we talked about earlier,
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:28.580]   which is being present to one's experience
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:30.680]   correlates with increased happiness.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:33.740]   Having your mind wander,
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:37.580]   having your default mode network be one of mind wandering
[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:41.140]   actually is correlated with being more unhappy.
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:43.700]   That was the earlier study that we talked about,
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.840]   that study published in "Science."
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.640]   Now, of course, meditation can make us more present,
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:50.620]   but if we do not pay attention
[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:52.660]   to whether or not we are becoming more present
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:55.900]   to interoception or exteroception,
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:59.220]   that is to interoception or dissociation,
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:02.020]   and we don't pay attention to whether or not our bias
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.860]   is one of dissociation versus interoception,
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:07.520]   we don't know where we are in the continuum,
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.600]   well, then the meditation
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.680]   actually can make things worse, not better.
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:14.200]   In other words, if you're somebody
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.740]   who has a tremendous amount of interoceptive awareness,
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.140]   well, then meditating on your internal state
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.060]   may not be good, and actually there's some evidence
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.380]   that it may actually be bad.
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.020]   I'll give you one little tiny example.
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:28.100]   I've talked about this previously in the podcast,
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:30.260]   but in that very study from Wendy Suzuki's lab
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:32.040]   showing that 13 minute a day meditation
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.740]   is beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera,
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.880]   it's also very clear that for a number of people
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.140]   that do that typical third eye meditation
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.460]   for 13 minutes a day,
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.320]   if they do that too close to sleep,
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:44.580]   or when they want to go to sleep,
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:46.320]   they have a hard time falling asleep,
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.260]   which makes perfect sense
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:49.680]   because they are becoming more interoceptively aware,
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.460]   they are ramping up their level of focus.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.500]   A meditation practice typically
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.940]   is a focus and refocus practice,
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:58.820]   and falling asleep involves turning off your thoughts
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:02.320]   and your focus, and focusing purely on sensation,
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:03.940]   and then your thoughts kind of fragment
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:05.240]   and you drift off to sleep.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.780]   This is why I'm a big fan of using non-sleep deep rest
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:10.140]   or yoga nidra, we will provide links
[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:12.380]   to non-sleep deep rest and yoga nidra protocols,
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.640]   I've talked about them on the podcast before,
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.220]   but those protocols are not meditation per se,
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:22.500]   they tend to have people defocus,
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.420]   they are anti-focus practices,
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:27.660]   whereas meditation tends to be a focusing practice.
[01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:30.580]   Along those lines, a meditation practice
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:33.800]   that is one that is exteroceptively biased,
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.260]   where you focus on things that are outside your body
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:38.720]   can be wonderful for somebody
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:41.140]   who tends to focus too much on their inner landscape
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.380]   and their inner narrative, et cetera,
[01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:44.960]   can help get them out of their head and body,
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:46.740]   which can be very beneficial,
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:49.080]   but for people that are not in touch with their emotions,
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:50.300]   aren't in touch with how they feel,
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:52.740]   it actually can drive them down the exact path
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:54.280]   that's wrong for them.
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:56.220]   So today's discussion is about meditation,
[01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:58.700]   and we want to make sure that we are parsing meditation
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:03.680]   in a rational way that matches the neural circuitry involved
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:07.140]   and more importantly, for sake of practical purposes,
[01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:09.700]   that you are asking yourselves the right question,
[01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:12.260]   are you interoceptively or exteroceptively biased?
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.340]   Do you tend to dissociate
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:18.340]   or do you tend to sort of feel everything in a big way?
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.700]   I've heard this term of hypersensitive people
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:21.540]   or things of that sort,
[01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:24.120]   and some of those are clinical terms, some of them are not,
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:25.140]   but you need to assess this
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:27.260]   and you also need to assess where you happen to be at
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.820]   on a given day, which will be dictated, of course,
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:33.340]   by how well you slept, life experience, et cetera.
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:36.100]   So this interoceptive to dissociative continuum
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:38.380]   is one that you need to address
[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:40.800]   prior to any meditative practice.
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:44.840]   And again, the solution or the answer of what to do
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:47.740]   in response to your answer
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:49.980]   of whether or not you are more inward focused
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:52.340]   or outward focused, again, is very simple.
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:55.100]   Just do the opposite of where your bias lies.
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:57.020]   That is, if you're tilted towards interoception,
[01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:59.420]   do an exteroceptive focus practice.
[01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:02.460]   If you are more dissociative and you're,
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:05.480]   that sounds sort of pejorative, it sounds bad, right?
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:07.420]   But again, if you are somebody who's more focused
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:09.200]   on events outside your body
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.040]   and you want to gain more interoceptive awareness
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:14.240]   and feeling state, if you will,
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:16.400]   well, then you want to do a practice
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:19.120]   that's third eye center practice or breathing focused.
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.600]   One of the reasons that many people meditate
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:24.520]   is that they've heard before or they've experienced
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:27.180]   that meditation can replace sleep
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:31.640]   or can reduce one's overall sleep need.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.260]   So that's an interesting set of questions.
[02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:35.380]   And it's one that I dove into the literature
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:36.780]   to pursue an answer to.
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:39.260]   And I came up with an answer that was, frankly,
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:41.120]   a little bit complicated on the face of it,
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.220]   but boils down to some very simple protocols
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:45.860]   that I think any and all of us can leverage
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:49.220]   in order to sleep better and maybe even reduce
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:51.040]   the total amount of sleep that we need,
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.340]   something that I think most people would want.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:55.900]   I, you know, I realized that we all
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:58.020]   probably should enjoy sleeping, I certainly do,
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:59.440]   but that it's hard to get enough sleep.
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.180]   And wouldn't it be wonderful, for instance,
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:03.300]   to be able to get by on a little less sleep
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.100]   and still feel alert and rested.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:09.180]   First of all, I want to point to the recent study.
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:11.560]   And then again, this is one that I've raised a few times
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.980]   and we'll post a link to it entitled
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:17.380]   Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory,
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:20.740]   Mood, and Emotion Regulation in Non-Experienced Meditators.
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:23.140]   This is the work, again, from Wendy Suzuki,
[02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:25.980]   who was a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:29.020]   who is now the Dean of Arts and Sciences
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:31.660]   at New York University and has run a laboratory
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.540]   focused on memory for a long time,
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:35.860]   is a terrific neuroscientist and researcher
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:37.140]   and teacher, et cetera,
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:39.480]   and was a terrific guest on the podcast.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:40.600]   I keep returning to this paper
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:42.780]   because they used so many measures
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:44.060]   and they were very thorough
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.240]   and the results were really interesting.
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:47.360]   Again, this is the 13 minute a day
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:48.960]   guided meditation session.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.660]   I should just mention that the control group in this study
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:54.640]   listened to a podcast for 13 minutes
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.740]   that did not improve attention, memory,
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:01.780]   mood, emotion regulation, et cetera,
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:03.220]   as much as meditation did,
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.360]   which is not to say that podcasts aren't useful.
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.100]   I won't mention which podcasts they use.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.920]   Unfortunately, it was not the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:12.420]   which I like to think at least increases understanding
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:15.940]   of certain key concepts of science and science-based tools.
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:16.900]   You're welcome to look at the paper
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:18.400]   and see which podcasts they used.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:20.200]   It's a quite a well-known podcast,
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.380]   which is an interesting podcast,
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:25.120]   but it didn't change the brain in any fundamental way
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.240]   in this 13 minute session,
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:28.600]   whereas 13 minutes of daily meditation did.
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.440]   And again, something I mentioned earlier,
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.680]   but very important to reemphasize now
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:37.680]   is that they mentioned that if people in the experiment
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:40.640]   meditated too close to bedtime,
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:42.600]   they had trouble sleeping again, which makes sense
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:45.160]   because meditation, at least in its most common form
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:46.260]   and the form used in this paper,
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:48.840]   is a focusing and refocusing exercise.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:51.540]   Falling asleep involves focusing less.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.760]   There are other studies, however,
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.460]   that have shown, or that asserted, rather,
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:03:01.100]   that doing two 20 minute sessions per day of meditation
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.600]   can reduce the need for sleep.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:06.560]   Those results are debated.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.160]   First of all, understanding what sleep need is
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:11.740]   is very individual,
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:14.600]   and determining what people can manage on,
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:17.960]   meaning some people can manage to get by
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:20.560]   with six hours of sleep, but would do better with eight.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:23.820]   Some people would actually manage probably better
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:25.120]   in terms of focusing and alertness
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:26.320]   if they slept a little bit less,
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.480]   because they might be waking up
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:28.920]   midway through a sleep cycle.
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:30.400]   If you want to learn more about this,
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:33.220]   you can check out any one of three different episodes
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:34.060]   that we've done.
[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:35.660]   One is Master Your Sleep.
[02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:37.160]   You can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:38.960]   Everything is timestamped in that episode.
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.560]   The other is Perfect Your Sleep.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:42.600]   And then, of course, we've done episodes on sleep
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.800]   with expert guests like Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley.
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:47.920]   All of those can be found at hubermanlab.com.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.140]   In all formats, they're all timestamped.
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:53.580]   With that said, this assertion that has been made
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:55.680]   many times over, and certainly in the popular press,
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.500]   that regular meditation can reduce one's overall sleep need
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:02.480]   is controversial for the following reason.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:05.260]   Some groups find that indeed that is the case,
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:08.280]   and the interpretation is that the stress reduction
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:11.740]   that's brought about by regular meditative practice,
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:12.960]   and in this case, very regular,
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.720]   tends to be one or more typically two 20-minute per day
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.720]   meditation sessions.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.760]   That's quite a lot, I think, for most people.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:23.520]   If you think about 40 minutes, isn't that much time overall,
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:26.140]   but very few people will stick to that twice a day,
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:29.040]   20-minute meditation practice very consistently.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:32.640]   Well, the idea is that the stress reduction,
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:35.540]   which is clear and not debated,
[02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:38.800]   brought about by that type of meditation practice,
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.280]   is good at offsetting some of the cortisol increases
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:47.340]   associated with reduced sleep and leading people
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:50.600]   to be able to function cognitively and physically
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.140]   better on reduced sleep than they would
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:56.580]   had they not been doing the meditation practice.
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:59.180]   So the simple way of putting this is that
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:01.720]   if people meditate regularly, that's reducing stress.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:04.540]   The reduction in stress is reducing cortisol.
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:05.680]   Again, cortisol is healthy,
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:07.540]   but it should be restricted to early part of the day.
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:08.980]   You don't want too many peaks in cortisol,
[02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:10.540]   especially not late in the day.
[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:13.420]   By meditating, you get the healthy pattern
[02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:15.360]   of cortisol release.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:17.580]   You sort of inoculate yourself somewhat
[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:20.380]   against the unhealthy pattern of cortisol release.
[02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:22.420]   And as a consequence,
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:25.200]   either the sleep that people get is deeper
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:28.480]   and/or the total amount of sleep that they need is reduced.
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.420]   Now, a lot of people took that result
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:34.840]   and interpreted it as saying, well, if you can't sleep,
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:36.340]   then you can just meditate.
[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:38.540]   So one night you don't sleep or you have trouble sleeping,
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:41.340]   you just meditate the next day and you'll be fine.
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:43.380]   Well, certainly that is not supported by the literature.
[02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:46.020]   However, there is a practice, and again,
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:47.640]   it's one that I've talked about on this podcast
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.700]   many times before, but if you haven't heard me talk about it,
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:51.160]   there's a practice called yoga nidra,
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.040]   which literally means yoga sleep.
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:56.360]   It is a practice of doing not so much a focus meditation,
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:57.500]   but more of a body scan,
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:05:59.160]   focusing on the sensation of the body
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:02.260]   and actually trying to turn off that prefrontal cortex
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:04.260]   or reduce its activity.
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:07.240]   Yoga nidra scripts can be found on YouTube and elsewhere.
[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:09.180]   They are paralleled by a similar practice
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.100]   that I've talked a lot about called NSDR,
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:13.140]   or non-sleep deep rest.
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.260]   I put one out into the world,
[02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:15.860]   a short one that's 10 minutes long.
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:18.300]   You can just simply go to YouTube and put in NSDR
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:19.900]   and my last name, Huberman, there's one there.
[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:22.060]   Again, all of this is completely zero cost.
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:25.960]   Yoga nidra and NSDR have been shown
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:27.680]   in a fair number of studies,
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.260]   not as many as been done on traditional meditation,
[02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:32.680]   or I should say third eye-centered meditation
[02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:34.380]   or mindfulness meditation,
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:36.580]   but have been shown to replenish levels
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:38.620]   of certain neuromodulators like dopamine
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.680]   and reduce cortisol, reduce a stress hormone,
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:45.100]   at least as much, and by my read of the literature,
[02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:48.420]   significantly more than with traditional meditation.
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:51.220]   And there's a nice paper that we will provide a link to,
[02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:53.740]   which is entitled "Yoga Nidra Practice Shows Improvement
[02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:56.140]   in Sleep in Patients with Chronic Insomnia,
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:58.020]   a Randomized Controlled Trial."
[02:06:58.020 --> 02:07:03.120]   Basically, this study looks at, as the title suggests,
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:04.900]   people with chronic insomnia,
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:07.020]   although the results certainly carry over
[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:09.540]   or would carry over for people who don't have insomnia.
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.980]   The key result, I believe, in this paper,
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:15.420]   although there are many, is that, quote,
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:18.160]   "Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:19.500]   after yoga nidra."
[02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:20.660]   What do I mean by that?
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:23.160]   There was a statistically significant reduction
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.520]   in cortisol levels, the stress hormone,
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:29.520]   immediately after the yoga nidra practice
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:33.040]   that we believe would be paralleled by a very similar,
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.880]   if not equivalent, practice of NSDR.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.400]   NSDR is a lot like yoga nidra,
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:39.160]   but removes a lot of the kind of,
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.700]   let's just call it the sort of mystical language
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:41.540]   and the intentions.
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:44.440]   It focuses more on the physiology and the body scans.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:47.460]   I want to acknowledge that yoga nidra has been around
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:50.860]   for thousands of years and was certainly there before NSDR.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:52.300]   I also want to acknowledge that,
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.140]   and this was brought up also in altered traits,
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:57.420]   that sometimes language can be a barrier
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:07:59.260]   toward people embracing practices.
[02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:02.980]   In fact, this was recognized by Jon Kabat-Zinn
[02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:07.700]   when he created what he called mindfulness-based
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:10.860]   stress reduction practices, or MBSR,
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:13.320]   which was simply mindfulness meditation to reduce stress,
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.800]   but he called it MBSR, mindfulness-based stress reduction,
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:19.720]   as a way to bring it into the clinics
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:21.220]   that would otherwise perhaps be averse
[02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:22.900]   to something called mindfulness meditation.
[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:24.660]   Again, this gets more to the sociology
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:26.800]   and the cultural aspects than it does
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:31.260]   to any specific utility of one practice versus another.
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:32.320]   Here's the takeaway point.
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:34.780]   If you want to get better at falling and staying asleep
[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:36.280]   or falling back asleep if you wake up
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.300]   in the middle of the night,
[02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:41.680]   or if you are generally challenged with sleep issues,
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.100]   an excellent behavioral practice
[02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:45.120]   for which there are terrific data,
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.800]   meaning data that show that a stress hormone cortisol
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:51.060]   can be significantly reduced,
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.860]   as well as certain neurotransmitters can be replenished,
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:57.700]   as well as, and this is key and covered in this paper
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:00.880]   that I've mentioned a few moments ago on yoga nidra,
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:02.860]   that the total amount of sleep that you need
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:05.260]   can be reduced at least somewhat,
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:07.880]   well then yoga nidra or an NSDR practice
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:12.880]   done frankly any time of day is going to be beneficial.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:14.740]   Whereas if your goal, I believe,
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:17.660]   is to increase your ability to focus,
[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:20.960]   to improve your mood, and perhaps most importantly,
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:23.760]   to be able to maneuver yourself in a deliberate way
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:26.780]   along that interoceptive, exteroceptive,
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:29.180]   or interoceptive dissociative continuum
[02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:30.580]   that we've talked about so much,
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:32.840]   and to really shift your default mode network
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:35.640]   from one of being a mind wanderer
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:38.960]   to somebody who can focus and who frankly is happier,
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:42.780]   well then a more traditional third eye center type meditation
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:46.980]   or a more traditional exteroceptive focused meditation
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:48.240]   would be beneficial.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:49.800]   Again, which one of those you choose,
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:52.000]   either focusing inward or focusing on a point
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.280]   outside of you, again, should be dictated
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:56.800]   by whether or not you tend to be interoceptively biased
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:58.360]   or exteroceptively biased.
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.520]   But if you want to get better at sleeping,
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:02.460]   you want to get better at falling asleep,
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:04.780]   and you want to replace sleep that you've lost,
[02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:06.840]   I put that in quotes so that my colleagues
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:10.380]   like Matthew Walker don't come after me with,
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:12.460]   what would you come after me with, Matt?
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:15.300]   Probably with an alarm clock and I don't know,
[02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:18.060]   blankets and a pillow or something of that sort.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:22.720]   In all seriousness, it's very clear that replacing sleep
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:24.700]   that we've lost is an area of research
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:26.120]   that's still active and ongoing,
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:28.680]   but NSDR and yoga nidra are very promising,
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:33.680]   if not downright useful for replacing sleep that you've lost.
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:36.860]   Certainly the small amount of data that exists now
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:38.400]   point to the fact that they are,
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:39.980]   not the least of which is a beautiful study
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:42.380]   published out of Scandinavia showing
[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:45.520]   that a 30-minute yoga nidra, aka NSDR practice,
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.140]   can replenish levels of dopamine,
[02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:51.960]   which puts people in a position to be more action-oriented
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:54.160]   and focused, et cetera, when they come out of the yoga nidra.
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.260]   So certainly very useful practice.
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:57.980]   It's a form of meditation.
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:59.840]   We could call it meditation-ish,
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:02.340]   but yoga nidra and NSDR are not typically
[02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:04.540]   what people think about when we talk about meditation.
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:06.280]   Of course, this is an episode about meditation.
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:08.200]   The reason I bring up yoga nidra and NSDR
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:11.600]   is that many people meditate to enhance their sleepability,
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.360]   to reduce their total amount of sleep need.
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:17.140]   It appears that meditation is probably not ideal for that
[02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:19.120]   in comparison to yoga nidra and NSDR,
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:22.460]   but meditation is excellent, if not superb,
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:25.200]   for adjusting the default mode network toward more happiness
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:26.920]   by being more mindful and present,
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:30.440]   and for placing oneself in that healthy model
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.520]   of interoceptive dissociative continuum.
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:35.300]   So we've covered a lot of information,
[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:38.320]   and I like to think that I've given you some key decisions
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:41.360]   to make in developing a meditative practice.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.400]   The most important one, of course,
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:44.660]   being what will you do regularly?
[02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:46.480]   And maybe you're somebody who just answers that question
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:48.520]   by saying, "Look, I'm not going to meditate regularly.
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.620]   I just want to do the thing that's going to allow me
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:52.200]   to feel rested when I'm tired,
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:55.620]   and is going to allow me to adjust my state of mind
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:58.440]   when I'm not where I want to be for whatever reason,
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.480]   too anxious or too exhausted, et cetera."
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:03.560]   And for those people, I would say a practice like NSDR,
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:05.720]   yoga nidra will be immensely beneficial,
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:08.940]   as will a more traditional form of meditation.
[02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:12.260]   I also want to just remind everybody that an app
[02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:15.160]   that guides meditation, also with some information
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:17.340]   and some intention setting,
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:19.800]   such as the Waking Up app from Sam Harris,
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:21.640]   can be immensely beneficial.
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.000]   I've certainly found it to be beneficial.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.300]   I know millions of other people have as well,
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:27.200]   so I encourage you to check that out.
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.440]   We've talked about determining where you are
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:34.320]   on these continuums of interoception and exteroception
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:37.000]   in order to dictate what particular type
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.500]   of meditation practice you should do in a given moment.
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:42.040]   Whether or not you should focus your vision inward
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.760]   with eyes closed, or focus your vision
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:45.960]   and your attention outward, being a key component.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:48.840]   Whether or not you should do cyclic breathing,
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:52.380]   which will allow your focus to be off your breathing
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:54.740]   somewhat easier than if you do non-cyclic breathing,
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:56.720]   if you're doubling up on inhales or exhales.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:59.020]   Whether or not your breathing is going to be natural or not.
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:00.600]   And of course, you need to determine
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:02.220]   whether or not your meditation practice
[02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:05.160]   is designed to enhance your level of focus or to relax you.
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:06.860]   I would say that if it's designed
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:08.820]   to enhance your level of focus,
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:11.960]   that doesn't necessarily mean that it won't be relaxing.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.320]   You could do slow cadence breathing,
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.640]   third eye meditation could be very relaxing,
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:18.240]   and yet it's a focus and refocus practice.
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:20.980]   Whereas something like yoga nidra and NSDR
[02:13:20.980 --> 02:13:23.120]   is going to be more along the lines
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.940]   of replenishing yourself, replacing sleep that you've lost,
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:29.420]   or maybe even reducing your sleep need.
[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:32.980]   On previous podcasts, I've talked about hypnosis,
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:34.960]   and particularly the episode with Dr. David Spiegel,
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.600]   our associate chair of psychiatry.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:38.000]   I don't want to get into hypnosis now,
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.520]   but just understand that hypnosis is distinct
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:42.960]   from breath work, from yoga nidra, from NSDR,
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:45.420]   and from meditation, even though it includes
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:48.280]   some of those components, like focusing your attention,
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.460]   it involves actually directing your visual attention
[02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:53.140]   outward than inward to go into the hypnosis,
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:55.120]   it involves some breathing of a particular kind,
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:57.700]   it involves a specific imagery, et cetera,
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:00.620]   but hypnosis is distinct because hypnosis
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:05.100]   is really designed to fix or address a specific problem.
[02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:08.220]   Whereas meditation, NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera,
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:09.920]   typically are not.
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:13.280]   They can help fix problems such as anxiety,
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:16.740]   sleep issues, et cetera, but they generally are not directed
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:18.480]   toward a particular line of thinking.
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:20.540]   They can be, but typically they are not.
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:22.620]   Whereas hypnosis, almost always,
[02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:24.880]   especially in the clinical context, not stage hypnosis,
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:27.820]   but the clinical context for which there's a lot of research
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:30.840]   to show it can, for instance, help with quitting smoking,
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:34.020]   literally a quadrupling of the effectiveness
[02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:36.880]   for smoking cessation with something like the Reverie app,
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:38.900]   then if people just try and go cold turkey,
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:43.020]   or for reducing insomnia, or for reducing pain,
[02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:45.180]   or for any number of things, including trauma, et cetera,
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:49.240]   hypnosis is really great at dealing with specific issues
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:51.040]   and problems and tackling those.
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.460]   Meditation tends to be focused on other things,
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:54.680]   no pun intended.
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:56.340]   I'm guessing some of you are probably wondering
[02:14:56.340 --> 02:15:00.100]   where to start, or if you're already an avid meditator,
[02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:02.320]   where to go with all this information.
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:03.860]   For that reason, I just wanted to offer you
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:08.040]   a particular form of meditation that incorporates
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:12.440]   all of the features that I've talked about up until now
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.680]   in a single meditation practice.
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:17.580]   And it's a meditation practice that,
[02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:19.880]   for lack of a better name, I called STB,
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:21.500]   or space-time bridging.
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:24.560]   And the time component has to do with a very simple fact,
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:27.640]   which is when we focus our attention,
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:29.200]   visual attention or otherwise,
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.520]   on things close to or within our body,
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:33.580]   we tend to be fine slicing time.
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:35.240]   You can sort of think of your breath
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.620]   as more or less the second hand on your clock of existence,
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:42.840]   whereas when we tend to focus on things far away from us,
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.680]   we tend to parse or carve up time within bigger bins.
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:50.980]   If you've ever seen an airplane flying at a distance,
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:52.520]   it looks like it's moving very, very slowly.
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:53.960]   If you were right up next to that airplane,
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.640]   it's probably going five or 600 miles an hour,
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:57.320]   it would go by very quickly.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.760]   This is not a coincidence.
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:03.140]   Believe it or not, how you slice the time domain
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:04.680]   of your life and your experience
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:06.260]   has everything to do with your vision.
[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:08.180]   And the closer things are,
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:10.200]   the more finely you slice up time.
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:12.440]   The more closely your attention is placed on yourself,
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:14.740]   the more closely you slice up time.
[02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:17.200]   If you focus your visual attention very far,
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.960]   or you think about the other side of the world,
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:21.480]   for instance, and you envision that,
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:25.060]   well, then you're actually slicing time more broadly.
[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:26.160]   Hopefully that makes sense.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:29.820]   Fine slicing would be like slow motion, higher frame rate.
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:30.700]   Looking in the distance,
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:32.440]   you're actually taking bigger time bins.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:34.360]   So even though things look like they're moving more slowly,
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:38.880]   it's because your fidelity, your precision of measuring time
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.040]   is actually not as good.
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:43.920]   It's as if you're only have the hour's hand on the clock.
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:45.440]   So it seems like it moves very slowly.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:46.700]   Hopefully that makes sense to you.
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:47.920]   So there's a meditation practice
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:49.320]   that I call space-time bridging
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:51.720]   that incorporates everything that I've talked about today.
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.960]   It balances interoception and exteroception.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:56.360]   It balances interoception and dissociation.
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:01.080]   And it crosses the various time domains
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:04.160]   that the brain can encompass using vision.
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:05.820]   And it's a very simple meditation.
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:07.280]   It's one that I've been doing for years.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:09.440]   And it's one that we're starting to do some research on,
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:10.440]   but I'm just going to share with you
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:13.200]   because I think it's actually quite fun
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:14.840]   and can be quite informative.
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.200]   In fact, people have told me
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:18.480]   that it can even lead to some interesting insights,
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:21.140]   both during the meditation and outside the meditation.
[02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:21.980]   It's very simple.
[02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:22.800]   What you do,
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:25.080]   ideally you would do this outside or at a window,
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:27.760]   but what you do is you essentially close your eyes.
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.600]   I'm not going to do this now.
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:29.720]   I'm not going to close my eyes and do the meditation,
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:30.560]   but I'll describe it.
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:32.240]   You close your eyes and you focus your attention
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:34.560]   either on your third eye center or your breathing,
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:38.160]   and you try and put 100% of your perceptual awareness
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:40.780]   onto your breathing or your third eye center
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:43.240]   for the duration of three breaths, okay?
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:48.240]   So you're 100% or trying to be 100% in interoception.
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:50.400]   Then you open your eyes.
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:52.920]   You focus on the surface of your body someplace.
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:56.060]   I find that holding out my hand at sort of arms distance
[02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:58.100]   and focusing on the palm of my hand
[02:17:58.100 --> 02:17:59.640]   and focusing there visually.
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:02.320]   So I'm splitting my attention now between my hand,
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:04.360]   and I'm also going to pay attention to my breath
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:07.760]   for the duration of three full inhales and exhales
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:10.160]   while also focusing on my hand.
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:12.920]   So you're splitting interoception and exteroception
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:15.400]   as best you can, about 50/50.
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.680]   Then you subsequently look at some location
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:23.360]   in your immediate environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away,
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:26.100]   and you focus your attention on that location
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:27.700]   while also splitting your attention
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:29.200]   so that you're still paying attention to your breathing.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:31.520]   You do that for the duration of three breaths,
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.300]   but now you are in exteroception and interoception.
[02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:38.560]   Then you focus your attention at some distance further away,
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:40.140]   maybe the furthest distance you can see.
[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:42.700]   Now, this is why it's useful to do out of a window
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:44.840]   or on a balcony or outdoors.
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:48.140]   You focus on the furthest point, maybe a horizon,
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:50.860]   some furthest point for the duration of three breaths
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:53.300]   while also paying attention to your breathing.
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:54.980]   And sort of imagine a bridge between the two
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:58.260]   if you find it to be challenging to focus on both.
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:00.560]   And then, and this is where it can be a little tricky,
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:03.180]   but then what you actually focus on is the fact,
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:04.600]   and this is not an imaginary thing.
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.020]   This is a fact that you are a tiny speck
[02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:10.220]   on this big ball that's floating out in space, right?
[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:11.820]   The earth that's floating out in space.
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:14.200]   And you try and focus on your three breaths
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:17.040]   while also acknowledging that you are a small body,
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:20.580]   literally, on this very seemingly large body, the earth,
[02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:22.740]   but that's floating in a much larger,
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:27.460]   larger expansive place, the universe.
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:29.500]   And you do that for three breaths.
[02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:30.740]   And then you close your eyes
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:32.780]   and you go right back into interoception.
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:35.000]   And you might want to, and you do that for three breaths.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.360]   You focus on your interoception for three breaths.
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:38.560]   And you might want to march through
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:40.160]   these different locations a few times
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:41.320]   or back and forth if you like,
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:44.660]   but typically I will just do it for one segment
[02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:48.880]   at pure interoception, palm of hand,
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:52.620]   some distance in front of me, horizon, whole globe,
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:55.160]   universe thing, back into body, et cetera.
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:56.500]   Why is this useful?
[02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:57.780]   Why would this be useful?
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:19:59.280]   Why is it at all interesting
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:01.040]   or is this just some crazy idea?
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:04.180]   Well, the reason it's useful, I believe,
[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:08.900]   is that it has you deliberately step your awareness,
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:12.060]   your perception, through every position
[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:16.100]   along that interoceptive, exteroceptive continuum.
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:19.180]   Now, I did say to remain connected to,
[02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:21.980]   as they'll say in the yoga classes, aware of,
[02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:24.560]   I guess would be the more scientific way to state it,
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:25.600]   aware of one's breath.
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:26.980]   But if you wanted, you could actually try
[02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:29.620]   and put your awareness completely outside yourself.
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:31.480]   But most people will find that challenging to do
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:33.300]   if they're already paying attention to their breath.
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:34.200]   It's just hard to do.
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:36.660]   So I find it easier to just split my awareness
[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:38.960]   from interoception to exteroception.
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.420]   But by stepping through these different locations
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:45.420]   and then deliberately placing your perception,
[02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:48.340]   your awareness back into pure interoception,
[02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:51.620]   what you do is you essentially are practicing
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:54.040]   or exercising this incredible ability
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:57.040]   that the human mind has to deliberately place
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:59.880]   your perception at specific locations
[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:03.220]   along the interoceptive, exteroceptive continuum.
[02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:04.640]   And I think this is very useful
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:06.520]   because many of us, including myself,
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:09.460]   tend to get locked at one location along that continuum.
[02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:10.920]   For instance, if you're scrolling your phone
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.640]   for a long period of time,
[02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:14.320]   you may forget about your bodily sensations,
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:15.980]   but you generally forget about other things
[02:21:15.980 --> 02:21:17.220]   going on in the world.
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:19.100]   Or if you're very focused on things out in the world,
[02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:21.780]   you oftentimes can forget about your internal sensations
[02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:23.820]   and what's going on internally.
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:27.080]   And being functional in work, in life, in relationship,
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:30.940]   in all aspects, including your ability to fall asleep,
[02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:33.640]   involves stepping yourself along these different locations,
[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:36.280]   which again are not just physical locations
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:38.400]   of third eye center or your breathing
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:40.220]   or your hand or horizon.
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:43.060]   Those are just stations within space.
[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:45.280]   But remember, each one of those,
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:49.020]   just by way of how your visual system and the time domain
[02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:50.760]   are interlocked with one another,
[02:21:51.720 --> 02:21:54.340]   sets your mind in a particular time domain.
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:58.040]   And so much of what involves being a functional human being
[02:21:58.040 --> 02:22:01.400]   involves dynamically adjusting our attention
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:03.140]   from what we are doing on our computer
[02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:05.480]   to a question somebody asks and then back again,
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.200]   or from text messaging to listening to a lecture
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:12.640]   or a podcast, or from listening to a lecture or podcast
[02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:15.200]   and then going back into a mode of commuting,
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:17.280]   but making that commute either relaxing
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:18.640]   or maybe you do work on your commute
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:21.000]   or connect with family or friends, et cetera.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.080]   So much of the fatigue of life and the,
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:28.520]   I should say the maladaptive behaviors and emotions
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:31.760]   that show up in life are really not about any set
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:36.240]   of behaviors or emotions being wrong or right,
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.240]   but rather inappropriately matched
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:39.960]   to the space time domain that we're in,
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:42.800]   which again is just fancy nerd speak for saying,
[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:45.160]   being present and being mindful
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:49.280]   is a wonderful byproduct of a meditation practice,
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:52.040]   but it is but one of those stations
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:54.860]   along that space time continuum.
[02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:57.240]   The key element here is to step yourself
[02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:00.240]   through a practice deliberately so that you are flexibly
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:03.000]   and dynamically able to engage in conversation
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.480]   then disengage and focus,
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:07.180]   or focus and then disengage from the work you're focusing on
[02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:10.080]   and actually have a conversation or be in the world
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:12.840]   and move out of that interoceptive awareness
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:15.600]   to one in which you are dynamically engaged
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:17.500]   with the things around you.
[02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:19.440]   I realize this might sound a little bit vague.
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:22.340]   For that reason, I encourage you not to think about it
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:24.520]   too much, but rather to try the practice,
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:25.460]   see if it works for you.
[02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:27.620]   If it doesn't, that's fine.
[02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:29.560]   I think it is a good one for people that find
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:32.880]   that a third eye center or breathing focus
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:36.640]   and interoceptive meditation might be enjoyable to them
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:37.680]   or very beneficial to them,
[02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:39.160]   but they might want to try something new
[02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:40.760]   and other people who might find that that tends
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.020]   to put them too much in their own head.
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:45.720]   I think it also ought to be very useful for people
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:48.500]   that tend to be overly exteroceptive,
[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:50.760]   more in the dissociative end of the continuum
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:54.300]   and need to bring in a bit more of interoceptive awareness,
[02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:57.840]   but either can't do that or uncomfortable doing that
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:23:59.780]   because they're simply not interested in
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:02.680]   or comfortable with feeling so much of their internal state
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:04.120]   because that can either be overwhelming
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:06.260]   or that's just simply not the way they want to feel.
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.440]   Now, as we round up, I do want to acknowledge
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:13.440]   that there are an enormous number of rooms within the house
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:15.300]   or rather I should say within the castle
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:18.060]   that is meditation, including for instance,
[02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:21.860]   intention setting and mantras and an enormous number
[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:24.000]   of different features of meditation practices
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000]   that we simply did not have time to go into
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.120]   and or for which the research on
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:32.940]   is not completely ironed out yet.
[02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:36.200]   For that reason, in future episodes and not long from now,
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:38.680]   I'm going to be sitting down with experts in meditation
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:40.660]   that include neuroscientists and clinicians,
[02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:44.180]   but other experts in meditation that certainly are versed
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.920]   in those topics and where they can't point
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:49.960]   to specific research studies can certainly point us
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:54.140]   toward the utility of things like mantras and intentions
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:55.500]   as they relate to getting the most
[02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:56.840]   out of a meditative practice.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.980]   So I eagerly await those conversations
[02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:01.080]   and I hope you will join me for those as well.

[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:37.780]   It's Huberman Lab on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:39.940]   And all three of those places I cover science
[02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:42.000]   and science-based tools, some of which overlaps
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.120]   with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:46.240]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:47.900]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:50.080]   Thanks again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.520]   about the science and practice of meditation.
[02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:54.820]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:56.720]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:59.300]   [upbeat music]
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:01.880]   (upbeat music)
