[00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.480]   Today, we are discussing happiness.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.640]   We are going to discuss the science of happiness
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.720]   because indeed there are excellent laboratories
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.200]   that have worked for many decades to try and understand
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600]   what is this thing that we call happiness
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.640]   and what brings us happiness in the short and long term.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.820]   In fact, we could probably point to happiness
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.500]   as one of the most sought after states
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.480]   or commodities or emotions, whatever you want to call it.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.160]   Happiness is what many people are seeking
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.840]   in work, in relationships, and in general.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   And yet most of us can't really define
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.600]   exactly what happiness is or means for us.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400]   We can point to certain experiences,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.440]   we can try and describe our states of mind and body,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.880]   but most people recognize the feeling when we have it.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.400]   And we certainly recognize the feeling of not being happy,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.720]   whether or not that means simply not being happy
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.560]   as the absence of happiness or all out depression.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.760]   One of the key problems in trying to understand happiness
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   and indeed the science and psychology of happiness
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.700]   is that it does indeed involve other similar things,
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.400]   things like joy and gratitude and meaning.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.120]   And indeed, many scientists and psychologists
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.560]   have argued for many, many decades
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.400]   about what happiness really is.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.840]   We can come up with so-called
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.620]   operational definitions of happiness.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.580]   Operational definitions are basically agreed upon terms
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.680]   or agreed upon definitions and conditions
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.060]   that will define something such as happiness,
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.000]   much in the same way that we can all
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.680]   probably come up with an operational definition of milk,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.900]   but of course, milk can be cow's milk, it can be oat milk,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.100]   it can be soy milk, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.820]   So too, something like happiness can be micro divided
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.700]   and sliced and diced into as many things as we decide.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   Today, we are really going to focus on three main things.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.120]   First, we are going to define happiness as a brain state
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.400]   and as a state of mind and body.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.000]   We're going to take a look at what the science says
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.080]   about all of that.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.140]   Second, we are going to talk about tools and practices
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.600]   for placing ourselves into states of happiness.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.580]   And while for most of us, we think of happiness as something
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.020]   that only arrives through the acquisition of some goal
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.520]   or some thing external to us, and of course that is true,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.180]   there is also something called synthetic happiness
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.380]   or synthesized happiness, which turns out to be
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.020]   at least as powerful and perhaps even more powerful.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.900]   I'll just say right off the bat that I'm not going to tell
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.860]   you that all you have to do is sit in a chair
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.540]   and imagine being happy in order to feel happy.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.140]   Synthesized happiness actually involves
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.820]   some very concrete steps that have been defined
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.580]   by excellent labs in psychology.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.860]   So we're going to talk about synthesized happiness
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.200]   as it relates to what you can do to obtain happy states
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.260]   more readily or more frequently.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.340]   And then third, we're going to talk about some
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.940]   of the misconceptions or what I would call
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.700]   the contradictions of happiness research.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.180]   And what I mean by that is most of you have probably heard
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.260]   about the general conditions for obtaining happiness.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.720]   And they always seem to circle back to some
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.700]   of the same basic features of get great sleep,
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.660]   have great social connection, pursue meaning,
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.660]   don't focus to any overextend on things like pursuing money
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.800]   because there are indeed these studies that show
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.860]   that the amount of money that people makes
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.600]   does not necessarily scale directly with happiness.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.660]   We'll talk about those studies
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.540]   in some detail a little bit later.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.260]   And while all of that literature is very powerful
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.440]   and informative, there is what I see as a contradiction,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.100]   which is for instance, that for many of us,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.260]   including myself, especially in the years
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.020]   when I was in graduate school and a postdoc,
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.740]   there were times in which pursuing and being involved
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.620]   in work and pursuing degrees and finding meaning
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.620]   in my vocation actually separated me from the opportunity
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.920]   to have quite as many social connections
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.420]   or quite as much sleep or quite as much exercise
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.460]   or even quite as much sunshine for that matter.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.640]   So all of the things that we're told that we need
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.340]   in order to access happiness on a regular basis,
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.980]   oftentimes contradict with the pressures
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.040]   and the requirements of not just daily life,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.340]   but in building a life that allows us
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.460]   to have the kind of resources that we need
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.980]   in order to have things like quality social connection
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.380]   and the time and opportunity to get regular exercise
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.720]   and great nutrition, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.220]   So again, while this isn't necessarily a complaint
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.020]   with any of the research out of the fields of psychology
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.400]   on happiness, it is important that we acknowledge
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.420]   these contradictions that exist
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.860]   in the discussion around happiness,
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.000]   in particular, the popular discussions
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.820]   around the science of happiness.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.520]   So today, what we are going to arrive at,
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.660]   what you will finish this episode with,
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.360]   is a set of tools and a framework
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.680]   for understanding the pursuit of happiness
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.740]   in the short and long term as it relates
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.580]   to the research from psychology, but also the neuroscience.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.340]   And my goal today is really to try and place that all
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.620]   into a structured framework so that you can know
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.720]   where you are in your journey or the landscape
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.400]   around happiness and your pursuit of happiness.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.340]   And what I won't tell you is that you need to abandon
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.960]   all goals in terms of pursuing money, career, et cetera,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.520]   and simply focus on relationships.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.480]   But we will talk about what constitutes
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.760]   an excellent social bond or even an excellent conversation.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.740]   There's excellent research that points to the fact
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.760]   that even rather shallow connections,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.480]   that is connections between people
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.460]   that you happen to just see in the hallway
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.580]   on a regular basis, not even requiring close bonds
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.340]   of any kind, can be built into close bonds
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.980]   that can deliver a tremendous amount of feeling
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.820]   and genuine social connection
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.400]   provided certain conditions are met.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.720]   So today, again, is really about understanding
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.960]   the science of happiness,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.780]   understanding the mechanisms underlying
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.840]   what we call happiness, and providing you a framework
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.080]   by which you can pursue and achieve happiness,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.440]   not just as a long-term goal
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.360]   and not just as a day-to-day goal
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.460]   of little micro exercises of gratitude, et cetera,
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.960]   but rather as a way to think about happiness
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.480]   as a state that you have control over,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.760]   at least in terms of your ability to access
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.460]   what I would call the algorithms that enable us
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.640]   or open the opportunity to experience happiness.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.680]   Now, before we begin today's episode,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.840]   I'd like to talk about a very specific tool
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.880]   that applies, yes, to our pursuit of happiness,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.320]   but actually to our pursuit of everything,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.200]   including quality sleep and ongoing motivation, et cetera.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.520]   I've talked many, many times before on this podcast
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.880]   and on other podcasts and on social media
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.480]   about the critical value of getting regular bright light,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.200]   ideally sunlight in your eyes
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.480]   within the first hour of waking,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.700]   or if the sun isn't out when you wake up in the morning,
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.440]   to turn on a lot of bright artificial lights
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.680]   and then get sunlight in your eyes
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.540]   for anywhere from five to 20 minutes,
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.740]   depending on how cloudy it is,
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.920]   in the early part of the day.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.120]   Absolutely outsized effects on mood and focus during the day
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.440]   and quality of sleep at night.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.080]   Now, there's another sort of central tenet
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.880]   of getting great sleep and improving mood
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.760]   and focus throughout the day,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.520]   and that's to avoid bright artificial light exposure
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.000]   to your eyes between the hours of about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.600]   Now, leaving shift workers aside,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.760]   and we have an entire episode devoted to shift work,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.640]   most people are asleep at night and awake during the day,
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.540]   and you would be wise to avoid exposure of your eyes
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.380]   to bright artificial light between the hours of 10 p.m.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.680]   and 4 a.m.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.420]   If you're going to use screens or artificial lights,
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.820]   dim them down as far as you can.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.340]   Now, there are several studies that point to the fact
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.340]   that one of the major issues
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.180]   with getting bright light in your eyes
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.280]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.980]   is that it has a negative impact
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.260]   on the so-called dopaminergic or dopamine circuits
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.540]   of the brain and body, which can enhance depression,
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.100]   that is, lead to ongoing lower mood and affect.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.500]   So that's a reason to dim the lights
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.060]   or avoid bright lights between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.040]   However, I and many others
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.380]   need to use artificial light in screens,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.060]   sometimes even between the hours of 10 p.m. and midnight,
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.820]   or even midnight to 3 a.m.,
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.340]   depending on what's going on in my life or your life,
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.220]   that may include you as well.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.260]   Now, it turns out that there are powerful ways to offset
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.020]   some, not all, but some of the negative effects
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.320]   of viewing artificial lights
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.860]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.420]   And one of the most powerful ways to do that
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.760]   is to simply adjust the overall brightness
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.020]   of your artificial lighting
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.360]   throughout the day and in the evening.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.400]   So one of the issues nowadays that we're really facing
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.960]   is that people are simply not getting enough bright light
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.220]   in their eyes from sunlight
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.260]   or from other sources during the daytime,
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.840]   and they're getting far too much bright light in their eyes,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.040]   largely from artificial sources, of course,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.560]   in the evening and at night,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.060]   not just from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.320]   but also in the evening hours from 6 to 10 p.m.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.660]   and so on and so forth.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.100]   So a very simple yet powerful solution
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.420]   that's supported by peer-reviewed research in humans
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.900]   is to try and make your indoor working
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.900]   and/or home environment during the day
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.580]   as bright as possible.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.400]   Now, if you can achieve that through direct sunlight,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.240]   terrific.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.760]   If you can get outside a lot during the daytime, terrific,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.340]   but many people simply cannot.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.460]   But most people do have some windows in their environment.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.380]   I realize some don't, but most people do.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.380]   And as a consequence,
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.380]   most people are using rather dim artificial lighting indoors
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.740]   during the day, and then very bright artificial lighting
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.700]   indoors in the evening and at night.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.420]   That's a problem.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.800]   And if you think about it, logically,
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.980]   you want to do the exact reverse.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.000]   So it's been shown that if you simply increase the amount
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.060]   of bright artificial light that you were exposed to
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.060]   during the day, and remember, this is not an excuse
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.340]   to not get your morning sunlight viewing,
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.740]   but in addition to that,
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.800]   to make your indoor artificial lights very bright, bright,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.680]   bright, bright, bright throughout the day,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.240]   and then much dimmer from the hours of 6 PM until bedtime.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.620]   Or if you can't do that, then maybe as soon as you get home
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.520]   from about 8 PM until bedtime and then dim them way,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.920]   way down between 10 PM and 4 AM or off entirely,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.080]   that's going to be a far better pattern
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.040]   for your sleep-wake cycles, focus, mood, et cetera.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.920]   Then what most people do, which is to have a few windows
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.880]   in their indoor working environment during the day
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.440]   and keep the indoor lights rather dim at a time
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   when they need more photons, more light energy,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.740]   and then in the evening when they get home,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.320]   because it's dark outside,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.960]   they tend to turn the lights much brighter.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.720]   You actually want to do the reverse.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.280]   Now there's an even simpler solution,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.760]   which is to get some bright sunlight in your eyes
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.600]   right around the time of sunset.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.760]   It doesn't have to be exactly at sunset.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.700]   It could be in the late afternoon and evening,
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.720]   but it's been shown now in studies on humans,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.000]   and I'll provide a link to at least one of those studies,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.560]   that by getting some bright light in your eyes,
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.600]   ideally from sunlight in the late afternoon and evening,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.880]   and of course the timing will vary
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.200]   depending on time of year
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.460]   and where you are located on the planet,
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.120]   but facing the sun around sunset,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.360]   you don't actually have to see the sun
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.600]   cross down below the horizon,
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.480]   but facing the sun around that time
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.440]   for anywhere from five to 10 minutes or even less,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.400]   even two to five minutes,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.840]   can adjust the sensitivity of neurons in your retina
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.720]   that communicate light information to the brain
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.440]   and make it such that in the evening
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.320]   when you use artificial lights,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.380]   they aren't going to have as much of a detrimental effect
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.160]   on your dopamine system and for impairing your sleep.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.080]   Okay, so the idea is as much bright light,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.360]   ideally from sunlight, but also from artificial sources
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.340]   from the time you wake up in the morning until the evening,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.880]   maybe around six or seven o'clock,
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.480]   maybe in the summer months, a little bit later,
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.640]   and then really try and get as little bright light
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.080]   in your eyes as you can in the evening and nighttime hours.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.500]   And ideally you would also get some sunlight exposure
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.980]   right around the time of sunset or in the late afternoon.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.960]   Go outside, take your sunglasses off.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.660]   Don't try and do this through a windshield
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.560]   or through a window.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.800]   It will not work.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.260]   You have to get outside.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.200]   If you're under an overhang,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.940]   at least try and get some direct sunlight
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.440]   in your eyes at that time.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.360]   And that will adjust the sensitivity of your retina
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.280]   such that bright artificial lights
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.000]   or artificial lights of any kind
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.440]   that you're exposed to in the evening
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.240]   and in the late hours of the night
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.320]   won't have as much of a detrimental effect.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.560]   That said, if you go to the bathroom
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.100]   in the middle of the night, try and keep the lights dim.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.240]   Many people have asked whether or not, for instance,
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.440]   a nightlight or a flashlight is going to have
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.940]   as much of a negative effect.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.000]   This is very straightforward.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.640]   If you think about it, if you shine a light at something,
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.420]   you can see into your environment.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.260]   If you've ever been camping
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.320]   or you've walked with a flashlight,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.760]   you can see things around you
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.480]   that you wouldn't otherwise, of course.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.020]   But if you were to shine that light in your eyes,
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.280]   it would be far brighter.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.840]   So yes, of course, if you get up in the middle of the night
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.500]   and you can use your phone flashlight
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.040]   to illuminate the environment that you're in
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   so that you can safely go to where you need to go
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.200]   and then back to bed,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.620]   that's going to be far better than turning on the lights
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.300]   or, of course, shining light in your eyes, right?
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.640]   So the idea is bright, bright, bright
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.240]   in the morning and throughout the day
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.280]   and as dim and dark as possible at night.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.360]   And that afternoon light viewing provides
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.280]   sort of what I call a Netflix inoculation
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.080]   that will allow you to adjust your retinal sensitivity
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.660]   and give you a little bit more flexibility
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.400]   in terms of allowing some nighttime light exposure
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.000]   without the detrimental effects.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.680]   Now, I realize today's episode is about happiness.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.580]   It's not about sunlight or dopamine.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.200]   And yet, as we'll talk about more in just a moment,
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.320]   if you're not optimizing your sleep
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.520]   and if you are using or being exposed to light, rather,
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.360]   at the wrong times of the day/night cycle,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.160]   that is going to make it very hard
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.240]   for the other sorts of practices that relate to happiness
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.720]   to have their full impact.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.800]   So the backdrop, or I would say the kind of landscape
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.520]   of your chemicals and your hormones is powerfully controlled
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.840]   by not just the brightness of light,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.960]   but the timing of light
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.680]   and your exposure to light.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.440]   In particular, your exposure to light to your eyes
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.720]   is something that you have a lot of control over.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.320]   You don't have absolute control,
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.300]   but you have a lot of control over.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.740]   And it's been proven that even these small steps,
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.940]   which are completely cost-free,
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.640]   they require just a few minutes of time,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.660]   but no purchase of product or anything else,
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.200]   can allow you to greatly adjust your neurochemistry
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.320]   and your hormones in the direction of better mood,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.360]   better sleep, and happiness.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.120]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.500]   that this podcast is separate
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.880]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.800]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.640]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.700]   about science and science-related tools
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.020]   for the general public.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.120]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.820]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.040]   Our first sponsor is Thesus.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.240]   Thesus makes custom nootropics.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.040]   And as I've said many times before on this podcast,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.380]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.300]   because it means smart drugs.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.860]   And frankly, there are no specific neural circuits
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.920]   in the brain or body for being quote unquote smart.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.380]   Thesus understands this,
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.480]   and they've developed custom nootropics
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.320]   that are designed to bring your brain and body
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.940]   into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.460]   They use the highest quality ingredients,
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.400]   things like phosphatidylserine, alpha-GPC,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.980]   many ingredients that I've talked about before
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.660]   on this podcast and that I happen to use myself.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.420]   I've been using Thesus for over a year now,
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.460]   and I can confidently say
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.780]   that their nootropics have been a game changer.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.680]   For me, I like their nootropic for clarity.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.020]   I use that before cognitive work often,
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.040]   and I like their nootropic for energy,
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.600]   and I often use that before workouts,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.220]   in particular workouts that are especially intense.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.100]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.300]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.320]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.440]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.040]   can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.420]   One of the problems with a lot of blood tests
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.500]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.940]   is that you get information back about lipids
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.980]   and levels of hormones and levels of metabolic factors
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.460]   and so on, but you don't know what to do
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.480]   with that information.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.660]   InsideTracker has a very easy to use online site
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.780]   where you can monitor your levels
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.740]   and you can click on any specific marker,
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.100]   any specific hormone or metabolic factor,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.840]   and it will tell you the behavioral tools,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.780]   for instance, exercise, the nutrition tools,
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.020]   and the supplementation-based tools that you can use
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.700]   in order to bring those numbers into the appropriate ranges
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.060]   for your immediate and long-term health goals.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.460]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.260]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.900]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.580]   Helix makes mattresses and pillows
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.620]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.360]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress well over a year ago,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.980]   and it's been the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.540]   One of the things that makes Helix mattresses so unique
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.360]   is that they match the design of the mattress
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.020]   to your unique sleep needs.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.580]   So for instance, if you go onto their website,
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.680]   you can take a brief quiz.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.880]   It only takes about two or three minutes,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.720]   and you'll answer questions like,
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.020]   "Do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night?"
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.420]   Or whether or not you sleep on your back,
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.960]   your side of your stomach, or maybe you don't know.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.680]   Regardless, they will match you to the custom mattress
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.320]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.020]   For me, that was the Dusk DUSK mattress,
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.920]   which for me was not too firm, not too soft,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.380]   and was ideal for my sleep patterns.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.860]   You take the quiz and you'll find out
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.100]   what mattress is ideal for your sleep patterns.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.780]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.420]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.540]   take their brief sleep quiz,
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.140]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.760]   and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.240]   and two free pillows.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.340]   They have a 10-year warranty,
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.520]   and you get to try out the mattress
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.500]   for a hundred nights risk-free.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.420]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.860]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.520]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.860]   Let's talk about happiness,
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.180]   this thing that everybody seems to want,
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.260]   and yet not everybody can agree upon what exactly it is
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.480]   or how to get it.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.940]   Now, I want to start by quoting a previous guest
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.840]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.100]   and that is a colleague of mine
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.660]   at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Carl Deisseroth,
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.660]   who's both a bioengineer and a clinician.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.220]   That is, he's a psychiatrist who spends a lot of his time
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.340]   both running a laboratory and seeing patients,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.980]   human patients, of course.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.520]   And I once was at a meeting where I heard Carl say
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.580]   something to the extent of,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.020]   we don't know what other people feel.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.960]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.360]   we don't even really know how we feel.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.320]   And while that statement was meant to report
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.720]   several different things about the way that the brain works
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.740]   and emotions, et cetera,
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.740]   one of the things that he was emphasizing,
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.960]   and I know he was emphasizing it
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.160]   'cause he confirmed this for me,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.300]   was the fact that language,
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.040]   things like the word happiness or joy or meaning
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.420]   or pleasure or delight are actually not very precise
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.380]   when it comes to describing our brain and body states.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.340]   So for instance, if I tell you I'm feeling pretty happy,
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.400]   I know what that means for me, at least in this moment,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.260]   but you don't really know whether or not
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.980]   it means the same thing as what pretty happy means for you.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.140]   If I say I'm extremely happy and I have a big grin,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.420]   I have a grin on my face
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.220]   that I can't seem to wipe off my face,
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.780]   well, then you might get a sense of how much happier I am
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.540]   than pretty happy,
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.980]   but it's still hard to calibrate my level
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.060]   of internal state or happiness.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.580]   And the same is true for you and for everybody else.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.540]   And it's important for us to acknowledge this
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.860]   because at this point in human history, 2022,
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.360]   we don't really have a measurement like body temperature
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.840]   or heart rate or heart rate variability,
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.360]   or even a way to measure neurochemicals
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.300]   in the brain and body that give us anything better
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.340]   than a crude correlate or an estimate at best
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.220]   of what happiness is.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.140]   So that's really important to understand
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.620]   and to keep in mind throughout this episode.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.140]   It doesn't mean that we cannot have
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.260]   a strong data-driven conversation about happiness
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.900]   and what brings us to a state of happiness,
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.820]   but it's very important to understand
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.780]   that language is not an ideal
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.400]   and maybe even a deficient tool
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.620]   in terms of describing our emotions
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.480]   and our states of mind and body.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.140]   Now, equally important is to understand
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.060]   that while we do have neurotransmitters,
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.300]   that is the chemicals that are released
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.740]   between neurons and nerve cells
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.180]   that allow neurons to communicate,
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.540]   things like glutamate and GABA, for instance,
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.720]   and we have what are called neuromodulators.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.700]   These are chemicals also released by neurons
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.420]   that impact the electrical firing
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.040]   and chemical release of other neurons,
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.180]   things like serotonin and dopamine
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.060]   and acetylcholine and epinephrine.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.960]   Neuromodulators and neurotransmitters
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.060]   are always present in a cocktail in our brain and body.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.380]   That is, they are present in different ratios
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.640]   and at different levels.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.940]   So we need to completely discard with the idea
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.440]   that any one neurotransmitter or any one neuromodulator
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.980]   is solely responsible for a state of happiness
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.840]   or for a lack of state of happiness for that matter.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.000]   That said, it is true that for people
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.740]   that tend to have lower baseline levels
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.840]   of, for instance, dopamine, their levels of happiness,
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.620]   or we should say their self-reported levels of happiness
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.840]   tend to be lower than for those
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.500]   that have greatly elevated baseline levels of dopamine.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.080]   Now, this can be best appreciated at the extremes
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.720]   where, for instance, in conditions like Parkinson's disease
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.280]   or other conditions where people's levels of dopamine
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.700]   in their brain is severely depleted.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.720]   Mind you, we also see this in drug addicted individuals
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.180]   that are in a withdrawal state
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.280]   because they're trying to quit
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.720]   or they don't have access to the drug
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.420]   that normally stimulates release of dopamine.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.240]   Think the cocaine addict who can't get cocaine
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.340]   or the methamphetamine addict that can't
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.880]   or is trying to avoid taking methamphetamine
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.080]   or the Parkinson's patient who has fewer dopamine neurons
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.760]   because they degenerated.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.420]   Those individuals do tend to be more depressed.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.840]   They tend to have lower affect.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.440]   They are less happy.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.720]   At least that's how they report themselves to be emotionally.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.560]   And that's what we observe when we look at them behaviorally
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.280]   in terms of the amount of smiling,
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.240]   the amount of energy they seem to have.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.140]   At the opposite extreme,
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.140]   and while still focusing on the kind of pathology
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.640]   of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems,
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.040]   an individual who is in a manic phase of bipolar
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.320]   will tend to have very elevated levels of dopamine.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.080]   And those people will talk a mile a minute
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.280]   and they won't require sleep.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   And at least to them, every idea is an exciting idea
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.480]   and one that they want to pursue.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.360]   We did an entire episode about bipolar depression,
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.920]   AKA bipolar disorder.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.080]   So if you'd like to learn more about that,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.720]   please check out that episode.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.560]   That and all other episodes of the podcast,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.860]   of course you can find at Hubermanlab.com in all formats.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.480]   But the point here is that very low levels
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.780]   or very high levels of dopamine
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.540]   are correlated with certain states of, for instance,
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.720]   low happiness or the absence of happiness.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.780]   We could even call it depression in some cases,
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.460]   or extreme happiness, or even euphoria,
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.080]   sometimes even inappropriate euphoria,
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.260]   as is the case with bipolar depression,
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.660]   or sometimes called bipolar mania or bipolar disorder.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.780]   Now, of course, there's a range in between
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.780]   depressed and manic.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.580]   And most people fortunately reside somewhere in that range.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.380]   And it is indeed a continuum.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.020]   And I think it's safe to say that levels of dopamine
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.420]   probably do correlate with levels of happiness,
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.380]   but there is no one single chemical nor chemical signature
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   that is no specific recipe of two parts dopamine
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.820]   to one part serotonin to one part acetylcholine
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.700]   that we can say equates to happiness.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.380]   Indeed, there's now tremendous controversy
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.060]   as to whether or not, for instance,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.460]   having lower levels of serotonin
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.620]   is actually the cause of depression
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.180]   or merely correlates with depression,
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.220]   or maybe doesn't even correlate with depression at all.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.700]   This became especially controversial
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.500]   because in the last year,
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.960]   so-called serotonin hypothesis of depression
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.500]   has been called into question.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.060]   And indeed, it does seem to be the case
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.920]   that for individuals that are depressed,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.660]   their levels of serotonin can sometimes be normal.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.460]   However, and this is an important however,
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.560]   that does not mean that administering drugs
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.040]   that increase levels of serotonin in depressed people
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.700]   does not sometimes, and indeed often,
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.700]   help ameliorate some of their symptoms.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.860]   And I should mention that many of the selective serotonin
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.900]   reuptake inhibitors, so-called SSRIs,
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.800]   such as Prozac and Zoloft, et cetera,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.940]   are still considered excellent treatments
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.960]   for conditions like OCD and so on and so forth.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.420]   But what I'm trying to do is make two important points.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.420]   First of all, that language is not a great indicator
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.960]   of internal state, especially when trying to understand
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.060]   other people's internal state,
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.380]   and that is especially true for things like happiness,
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.380]   and that there is no one chemical signature of happiness.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.180]   There's no one neuromodulator
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.580]   or combinations of neuromodulators that we can say
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.860]   is the cocktail for happiness.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.600]   But, and it's a very important but,
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.300]   when levels of dopamine and serotonin
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.420]   tend to be chronically low for an individual,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.380]   below their typical baseline,
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.460]   they will, yes, tend to be lower in affect
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.260]   and have lower mood and less episodes of happiness
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.440]   per day, per week, per month, per year, et cetera.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.420]   Conversely, when an individual has elevations
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.860]   in dopamine and serotonin levels,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.780]   in particular dopamine levels,
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.660]   and the other so-called catecholamines,
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.700]   which include epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.300]   so the catecholamines are dopamine,
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.860]   epinephrine, and norepinephrine,
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.500]   they're all very similar biochemically,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.060]   they all lead to states of elevated motivation,
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.020]   energy, and so on.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.860]   When those chemicals are elevated above baseline,
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.340]   people do tend to have elevated sense of mood and wellbeing,
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.860]   and in particular sense of possibility
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.740]   about what they can do in the world
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.940]   and what the world can offer them.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.060]   So we need to acknowledge those two features
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.300]   of language and neurochemistry
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.120]   as we wade into the discussion
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.540]   about the psychology of happiness,
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.940]   and in particular about the controlled experiments
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.020]   that have been done in excellent laboratories
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.060]   focused on the psychology of happiness
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.540]   and what brings happiness and what does not.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.880]   There have been some excellent studies on happiness,
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.980]   and these come in two forms, generally.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.460]   One form of these studies
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.300]   is individuals come into a laboratory,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.060]   they participate in an experiment
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.260]   over the course of a day or months,
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.620]   and then data are collected, analyzed,
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.560]   and the papers are submitted and published and discussed.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.140]   The other form is a so-called longitudinal study
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.140]   where individuals come into the laboratory
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.020]   and they are studied over a very long period of time
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:06.020]   ranging from months to years and sometimes even decades.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:12.060]   And then the variables of age, life circumstances,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.780]   and other factors can be incorporated into the data.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.020]   And typically there are multiple papers,
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.620]   there's data published throughout the longitudinal study,
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.000]   or sometimes it's just one paper
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.580]   at the end of the longitudinal study.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.580]   Let's talk about one of the more famous
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.400]   and perhaps the longest running longitudinal study
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.240]   on happiness.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.780]   This is a study that was initiated or conceived in 1938
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.820]   at Harvard University,
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.960]   the so-called Harvard Happiness Project.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.640]   Some of you have probably heard about this.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.040]   It involved Harvard College sophomores
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.020]   and other individuals were incorporated
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.820]   into this study as well.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.820]   It's a study that initially had more than
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.900]   a couple of hundred subjects,
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.900]   but because some have either dropped out
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.220]   and not been able to be contacted
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.700]   and monitored over time or died,
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.340]   or for whatever reason are no longer participating
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.180]   in the study,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.220]   there are very few of these individuals left.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.660]   And yet there's tremendous power to a study like this.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.780]   It's such an impressive study.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.580]   And we're all so grateful that laboratories at Harvard
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.580]   decided to initiate and continue this study
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.700]   because it is one of the few studies,
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.060]   perhaps the study that has allowed us to understand
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.220]   happiness in our species over a very long period of time.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.860]   Like any study, it's not perfect.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.560]   It didn't include a lot of matching by sex
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.740]   or matching by vocation or matching by income and background.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.420]   And back then there was also a lot less discussion
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.420]   about trauma and histories around trauma,
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.980]   as well as positive episodes in people's lives.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.700]   Nonetheless, there's a lot of power in a study like this.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.140]   And there's some very basic takeaways,
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.560]   some of which you may have heard before,
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.780]   but some of which may be surprising
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.740]   those of you who haven't.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.620]   So one of the key things about this study
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.220]   is people in the study,
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.260]   at least those who still have intact memory,
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.980]   and which many of them do,
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.540]   are able to think back on not just their previous year
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.020]   or week, but 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago,
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.380]   and compare what makes them happy at one age
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.900]   versus another age.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.340]   A number of things have emerged from that conversation.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.000]   So I just want to discuss some of the highlight points.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.280]   Then we'll get into a little bit more
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.900]   of the nitty gritty of the data.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.180]   First of all, it's been discussed many, many times
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.020]   that the total amount of income
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.220]   that an individual makes or has,
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.640]   and again, this could be income from work,
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.380]   or it could be money that they inherited,
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.220]   does not seem to directly relate to their level of happiness.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.220]   Now, a lot of people take that point
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.780]   and think, ah, money doesn't matter.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.540]   Other people hear that point and think to themselves,
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.620]   yeah, right, easy to say if you have a lot of money.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.540]   We'll talk about the interpretation of those data
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.020]   in just a few minutes,
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.900]   but I do want to earmark that finding
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.900]   because I agree that while money or total resources itself
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.920]   does not predict happiness in any kind of direct way,
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.320]   that is not the same thing as saying
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.540]   having very few resources will make you happier, of course.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.580]   I don't think anyone would imagine that.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.060]   But it also tends to overlook an important point,
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.060]   which is something that I certainly have learned
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.620]   to appreciate in my life,
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.620]   and something that I especially appreciated
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.140]   when I was a student and postdoc, which is the following.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.500]   People will say money can't buy happiness,
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.780]   and we'll talk about the buy aspect of that in a moment.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.260]   And indeed, that's true.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.260]   If you look at this longitudinal study
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.740]   or you look at other studies
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.260]   that are done on a more short-term basis,
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.780]   once people get past a certain level of income
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.860]   relative to their cost of living,
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.580]   the amount of happiness does not scale with that income.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.640]   That is for every additional $1,000 or $10,000 that they earn,
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.240]   they don't report being that much happier on a daily basis.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   Now, that said, I venture the argument
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.400]   that while money truly cannot buy happiness,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.900]   it absolutely can buffer stress.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.700]   And in particular, it can buffer stress
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.900]   in the form of the ability to purchase or pay for
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.580]   goods and services, and in particular services.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.300]   You're not going to tell me that having children
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.820]   doesn't involve some increase in the demands on your life,
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.340]   less sleep and more demands.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.760]   And it certainly is the case
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.700]   that if you can hire help to clean,
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.620]   you can hire nannies if that's your thing,
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.680]   you can hire help to assist with babysitting
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.100]   or even night nurses if you're having trouble sleeping
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.860]   that will literally allow you to sleep
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.300]   while they take care of your child
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.700]   in the middle of the night,
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.840]   often give excellent care, one hopes excellent care,
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.460]   that that won't offset some of the stress
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.100]   associated with lack of sleep.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.220]   So there are a million different examples
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.140]   one could give of this,
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.200]   but I certainly experienced this during graduate school.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.820]   In fact, I experienced both sides of the equation here.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.340]   I made very little money as a graduate student.
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.300]   I had essentially no savings when I started graduate school
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.500]   and I made very little money.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.220]   The amount doesn't matter at this point,
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.040]   but I could just barely afford rent and my food,
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.300]   I actually opted to live in the laboratory
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.960]   a lot of the time.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.920]   And by doing that, I had more money to spend
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.340]   on other things that were important to me.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.660]   Now, I did not have a family at the time
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.180]   and so I was able to do that,
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.820]   something that not everyone can do,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.820]   but I made very little money,
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.900]   but at the same time I was in laboratory all the time
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.460]   and that's where I wanted to be.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.020]   And so my level of stress was actually pretty low
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.960]   because I was investing all my time and energy
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.420]   into the very thing that I knew would eventually
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.980]   help bring me more resources.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.320]   When I moved from being a graduate student to a postdoc,
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.840]   for instance, a postdoc is a generally
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.620]   a three to five-year period.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.540]   So like residency in medicine,
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.860]   where you're no longer taking courses,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.160]   but you continue to do research.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.840]   In fact, entire new lines of research
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.120]   and prior to getting a professorship,
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.960]   my income went up slightly,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.920]   went up by about 30 to 40%,
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.920]   but because of where I moved and because of the times,
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.740]   my cost of living went way, way up
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.800]   and I was extremely stressed.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.680]   So it wasn't my absolute income.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.280]   It was my absolute income relative to my cost of living.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.400]   The other thing that one needs to consider
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.480]   when considering income versus cost of living
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.980]   is there's also this notion of peer group.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.480]   And we're going to talk more about social bonds
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.900]   and connections later.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.280]   But one thing that I noticed when I moved
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.040]   from being a graduate student to a postdoc was
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.280]   I was a graduate student in a small town
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.360]   where I had access, if I chose,
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.900]   to participate in most, if not all, of the social gatherings
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.240]   because they were all very low cost.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.580]   People tended to aggregate at the farmer's market on Saturday.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.940]   Most people wouldn't even purchase anything,
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.340]   at least not the graduate students
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.180]   wouldn't purchase anything.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.360]   It was just a place to aggregate.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.320]   People would sometimes play pickup games of soccer
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.620]   or just hang out and have a cup of coffee.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.700]   There was a volleyball game on Fridays.
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.060]   Sometimes people would go out to eat that evening,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.260]   which of course cost money, et cetera,
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.860]   but it was relatively low cost of living
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.260]   and social connections and peer group interactions
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.520]   were all generated around
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.400]   the same fairly low cost activities.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.700]   When I transitioned to being a postdoc, I made more money,
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.800]   but cost of living went up.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.220]   But in addition to that,
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.560]   my peer group tended to want to engage
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.940]   in the same kinds of activities
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.380]   that people in that larger city were engaged in.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.260]   So peer group has a tremendously powerful influence
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.340]   on whether or not we gauge the amount of money that we have
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.620]   as bringing us happiness or not.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.620]   And that really speaks to the critical importance
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.220]   of social interactions
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.420]   and certain kinds of social interactions in particular.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.460]   Now, if any of that was unclear,
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.780]   what I'm basically saying is,
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.140]   it's not just about being able to pay your rent.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.380]   It's also about being able to access
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.300]   the kinds of social interactions that you deem
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.900]   are quote unquote correct for you at that stage of life
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.920]   and in the place where you happen to be living.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.820]   Because if you can meet all the demands of costs of rent
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.660]   and paying your power bill and food, et cetera,
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.420]   but you are socially isolated because your peer group
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.860]   or those around you that you want to engage with
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.340]   are engaging in activities
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.060]   that you either don't have time for literally
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.100]   because you're doing other things
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.240]   or that you don't have the financial resources for,
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.280]   then that can actually severely impact
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.220]   this rating of what we call happiness.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.020]   Why am I parsing this so finely?
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.900]   Well, I'm parsing it finely
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.220]   because I think that most of us have heard the outcome
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.900]   of this study from Harvard
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.300]   or the more short-term studies,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.760]   also many of which are from Harvard.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.520]   We'll talk about the just phenomenal work
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.600]   from Dan Gilbert's laboratory and other laboratories
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.560]   who have focused on issues like these.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.060]   And I certainly don't want to take anything away
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:49.900]   from those results.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.980]   They're very powerful and important results.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.860]   They really point over and over to the fact
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.820]   that people's happiness
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.820]   does not necessarily scale with income.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.740]   In fact, it tends not to past a certain level.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.180]   And yet I think we'd be remiss,
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.360]   I think actually it would be inappropriate for me to say
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.900]   that the amount of income that one makes is not important
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.420]   because if the amount of money that you happen to have
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.940]   or are making does not allow you to meet your basic needs
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.620]   of shelter, healthcare, et cetera,
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.760]   and or doesn't allow you to access
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.340]   the kind of social interactions that can renew and reset,
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.540]   or I would say directly enhance
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.960]   the kind of neurotransmitter systems and hormones
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.740]   that lead us to feel that we are happy in our life
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.900]   and we're having quality social connections,
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.360]   well, then that's very stressful.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.220]   And this brings me back to the statement I made earlier,
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.280]   which is indeed money cannot buy happiness,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.380]   but it certainly can buffer stress.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.500]   And one of the ways that it buffers stress
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.100]   is by allowing options
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.740]   of different kinds of social interactions,
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.580]   options of different types of recreation
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.420]   that one can engage in
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.300]   to access new forms of social interaction.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.540]   And so on and so on.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.140]   So we need to be a little bit careful
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.220]   or at least nuanced about this statement
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.540]   that money can't buy happiness
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.740]   and that the data support the fact
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.280]   that wealth doesn't determine happiness.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.000]   I think there is a truth to that,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.700]   but there's another side to that
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.180]   that I think is less often acknowledged
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.940]   and that certainly I've experienced
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.560]   and that I think many of you out there
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.260]   probably experienced as well.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.180]   One other major finding
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.580]   of the Harvard longitudinal study on happiness
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.480]   as well as shorter term studies on happiness
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.640]   is that much as you've heard perhaps
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.600]   that no one on their deathbed
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.860]   says they wish they had worked more.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.000]   Well, indeed the total amount of time
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.640]   that one spends working
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.320]   does not seem to determine one's happiness.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.880]   And yet I also want to earmark that result
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.920]   as one that we need to parse a bit more carefully
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.340]   because work, last time I checked and certainly for me,
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.080]   is the way typically that people earn an income.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.520]   And as we just talked about a moment ago,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.860]   income is often a way that people have access
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.740]   to or provide access for their family
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.560]   to things like recreation that opens up the opportunity
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.520]   for more social connection, right?
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.420]   So we have to be careful
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.400]   with how we interpret these blanket statements
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.980]   that have become very popular
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.380]   that money doesn't determine happiness
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.140]   and that the amount that you work
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.420]   isn't going to determine happiness.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.540]   It certainly is the case
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.960]   that if you earn more money from working more
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.760]   and that money is devoted to things
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.440]   that bring more opportunities for social connection
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.840]   or for buffering stress in other areas of your life,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.800]   including healthcare, care for your children,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.880]   care for yourself, recreation, other things that you enjoy,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.020]   well, then I think it's a little bit naive
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.020]   to assume that work itself is somehow counter to happiness,
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.080]   which of course it isn't.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.660]   And it especially isn't if we combine that feature of work
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.200]   with another important feature of the human psyche,
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.080]   which is this notion of meaning.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.440]   Now, in the not too distant future,
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.400]   we will do an episode of this podcast on meaning
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.720]   and what constitutes meaning in a given endeavor,
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.280]   work or otherwise.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.360]   But much of the psychology of the last century
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.380]   and still today focuses on this feature of meaning
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.660]   as a critical one in terms of what makes us happy
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.380]   and what doesn't make us happy.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.480]   Certainly in the longterm.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.840]   And I can certainly say for myself that learning
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.360]   and teaching and doing research in my laboratory
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.280]   brings me tremendous feeling of meaning and happiness.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.900]   Some people consider their work simply a way
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.540]   to gain a paycheck and other people find
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.360]   that they would do the very work they do
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.040]   regardless of whether or not they were paid.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.040]   In fact, many people will do volunteer work
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.680]   and other forms of work for zero money.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.240]   So this idea that money isn't important
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.840]   or that work is not as important as we deem it to be,
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.820]   that also needs to be considered
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.560]   from a number of different perspectives.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.060]   And again, by no means am I trying to undermine the data
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.460]   of these impressive studies,
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.560]   both the longitudinal and short-term studies,
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.020]   but I think we do have to be cautious
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.360]   in our discussion of results like these
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.000]   because the internet is replete with conversations
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.920]   about the big factors that determine happiness.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.280]   It's going to be social connection, not income.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.100]   It's going to be the amount of time
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.080]   that you are able to have open thinking and creativity,
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.100]   which I think is an essential feature of happiness,
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:25.940]   by the way.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:30.940]   Physical health, in particular one's ability to stay mobile
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.900]   and to be able to access the kind of daily activities
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.420]   that one needs to accomplish unassisted
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.220]   is a strong correlate of happiness and so on and so on.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.080]   And of course there are the basic physiology factors,
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.960]   the things that feed back onto our overall feelings
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.800]   of wellbeing.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.520]   And I've talked about these before,
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.680]   and we'll just put these quickly into a bin.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.560]   You can think of this as a toolkit of things that you
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.880]   and everyone really should be constantly trying to access,
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.660]   if not optimize on a regular basis,
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.080]   because they raise the tide or what I would call
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.760]   the buoyancy of your overall system,
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   meaning your brain and body.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.040]   And that would be getting sufficient deep sleep
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.000]   at least 80% of the nights of your life.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.600]   And ideally the remaining 20%,
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.140]   you're not getting deep sleep or as much of it
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.400]   because of positive events.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.740]   Quality nutrition, quality social interactions,
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.720]   and we will define that a little bit better.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.520]   In fact, we will define that in a lot of detail
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.000]   later in this episode and actually how to get better
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.800]   at creating quality social interactions,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   even very brief social interactions.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.160]   So we have sleep, we have nutrition,
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.160]   we have social interactions, we have purposeful work,
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.840]   whether or not it's paid work or non-paid work.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.960]   And of course there are things like exercise
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.100]   and maybe relationships to pets and things of that sort.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.040]   And there are a few others as well.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.600]   All of those are known to increase your overall state
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.300]   of wellbeing that puts you in a position
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.000]   to access more meaning and happiness, et cetera.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.620]   But for most people, I think it's fair to say
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.840]   that earning a living and earning a living by working
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.080]   is the typical way in which we spend most of our time.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.480]   So I think we need to put a special bracket
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.540]   around those activities.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.600]   And it's something we'll return to a little bit later
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.400]   in terms of trying to understand how periods of life
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.160]   in which there are big or extensive work demands
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.880]   or extensive family demands on us are indeed compatible
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.240]   with states of happiness or frequent states of happiness
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.120]   and how better to access those.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.300]   Rather than simply say money isn't important
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.280]   or the amount of time at work really isn't important.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.100]   That's not what people are going to pay attention to.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.720]   In fact, I don't know how I will feel on my deathbed.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.200]   How could I?
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.680]   Human beings are pretty good about understanding
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.000]   how they feel in the present.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.340]   If not describing it, they are pretty good at feeling it.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.100]   If they have any sense of internal state
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.060]   that is interoception, you get some idea
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.460]   of how you feel in a moment.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.160]   We're pretty good about describing our past feelings,
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.700]   at least in broad contour, but we are not very good
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.760]   at projecting how we will feel in the future.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.320]   And in fact, that's a theme that's going to come up
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.520]   again and again today.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.600]   Nonetheless, what we do know on the basis
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.920]   of really solid data are that certain aspects
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.180]   of our wellbeing tend to change across our lifespan.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.780]   Now, lifespan is something that we need to consider
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.360]   from also a bit of nuance because humans are indeed
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.900]   living longer and longer.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.820]   And if we look at the data on happiness
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:32.120]   across the lifespan dated maybe 30 or 40 years back
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.740]   or even 20 years ago, it is consistently described
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.760]   in that literature as a so-called U-shaped function
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.580]   where people in their 20s report being very, very happy.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:49.080]   But as time goes on and they acquire more responsibility,
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.640]   so typically getting married and having children
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.860]   in their mid to late 20s and 30s and into their 40s,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.140]   having more work demands, et cetera,
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.220]   happiness tends to be rated lower and lower,
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.840]   at least in those previous studies.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.560]   And then happiness tended to increase
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.440]   as people approach their 50s and 60s,
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.700]   and they tended to retire and their work demands
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.740]   were shed from them and they were able to enjoy
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:16.140]   the small things of life, despite the fact that in general,
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.200]   I would say almost always people's health
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.720]   is not as vigorous when they're 70 as it is when they're 20.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.480]   There are exceptions to that, of course.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.220]   And of course you can adjust the rate of cognitive
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.120]   and physical decline.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.760]   But in general, people in their 20s feel more physically
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.320]   and mentally vigorous than they do
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.500]   in their 60s and 70s in general.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.360]   That U-shaped function that I just described
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.240]   still holds true today,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.760]   but of course there've been some major shifts
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.900]   to the general life stages
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.000]   and when people undergo those life stages.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.460]   For instance, many people are getting married much later.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.480]   Many people are opting to not have children.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.140]   In fact, if you look at the data
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.780]   on whether or not people have children or not
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.220]   and how that relates to happiness,
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.820]   everyone will tell you that their kids
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.180]   are their greatest source of joy,
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.960]   at least most people will tell you that,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.100]   and are a tremendous source of happiness.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.820]   It's obvious kids are delightful
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.940]   and raising kids while hard is a wonderful experience.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.620]   If you look at the ratings of happiness
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.740]   among people that elected, elected,
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.180]   to not have children versus those that had,
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.240]   most people who have children
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.280]   report their overall levels of happiness
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.200]   as lower than that of people who opt not to have children.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.040]   Now, there are a lot of ways to interpret those findings
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.860]   and by no means am I encouraging people
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.920]   to not have children.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.220]   That's a issue that you have to resolve
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.060]   for yourself, of course.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.540]   But we could imagine, for instance,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.100]   that people who opt not to have children
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.520]   have more income to devote
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.460]   to things more focused on themselves or their partner
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.500]   or other aspects of their life.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.740]   We don't know if that's the underlying reason.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.760]   We could perhaps conclude
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.080]   that people who opt not to have children
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.860]   are getting more sleep on a regular basis
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.200]   or have more time for exercise
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.300]   or the other sorts of things
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   that elevate states of mood and wellbeing.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.560]   Again, we do not know
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.840]   what the underlying reasons are for this finding,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.480]   but it does seem that despite most every parent
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.140]   reporting that their kids are their greatest source of joy
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.960]   and "happiness" in life,
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.140]   that people who opt not to have children
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.560]   are at least as happy or report being at least as happy
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.120]   or even happier than those that opt to have children.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.180]   And of course, I want to be very clear
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.260]   that I'm not trying to settle any arguments
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.140]   about whether or not people should have children or not.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.300]   I happen to find children and animals delightful,
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.780]   and I'm always happy when people opt to have children,
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.340]   provided they are taking good care of their children
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.460]   or doing their very best
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.800]   to take good care of their children.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.420]   So that's my stance,
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.060]   but of course, you're all entitled
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.620]   to your own stance on this.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.600]   There are also the general arguments
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.440]   that people like to have
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.700]   about whether or not the population of the earth
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.120]   will be sustained or not sustained
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.740]   based on current birth rates, et cetera.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.980]   Indeed, many areas of the world birth rates are going down.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.980]   Is actually something that,
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.620]   just as a perhaps point of interest,
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.740]   has been studied from the somewhat unusual,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:13.740]   but logical perspective of whether or not child diapers
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.580]   are selling at the same rate as they were some years ago,
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.300]   and whether or not adult diapers for the elderly
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.860]   are being sold at the same rate or greater.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.020]   That, if you think about it,
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.980]   is one indirect measure of whether or not
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.940]   people are living longer and/or opting to have children.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.560]   Definitely a discussion for another time,
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.920]   probably for another podcast entirely.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.300]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.340]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.800]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.180]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.060]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.740]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.980]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.580]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.660]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.620]   once or usually twice a day
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.220]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.340]   Our gut is very important.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.900]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.640]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.040]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.680]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.540]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.380]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.540]   In addition, Athletic Greens
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.840]   contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.460]   that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.180]   are met, and it tastes great.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.620]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:31.020]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.000]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.320]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.900]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.300]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.980]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.360]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.300]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.920]   So this U-shaped function
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.340]   of people being happier earlier in life
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.920]   and then reporting feeling far less happy
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.700]   and then happiness returning to them,
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.660]   that is the rising of the U again in their later years,
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.340]   is something that I do believe
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.100]   should be repeated in modern times
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.820]   and repeated in a way that takes into account
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.940]   that that U might be shifted to the right.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.620]   That is, I am certainly aware
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.860]   that people are tending to get married later.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.420]   Many are opting to not have children.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.580]   So for instance, the question arises
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.060]   whether or not that U-shaped curve
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.300]   should have a bump down at the bottom of the U
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.080]   among those that opt not to have children,
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.600]   because the argument was made in the discussion
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.360]   of those papers that the reason why happiness is lower
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.320]   when people are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.600]   is because they're devoting more time
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.160]   to raising their children and devoting more time to work.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.760]   I would hope people would enjoy their work,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.560]   but not everybody really enjoys their work.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.080]   And many people, even if they do enjoy their work
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.960]   and they find meaning in it, still find it stressful,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.840]   which certainly can run counter to happiness.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.280]   Nowadays, you could imagine that
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.320]   because a number of people are opting perhaps to work less
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.520]   or to not have children or both,
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.240]   where they find tremendous meaning from their work,
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.440]   that there would be a bump at the bottom of that U
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:08.960]   among those that decided to simply not take on
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.260]   these additional responsibilities.
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.160]   That would be an interesting test, I think,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   of whether or not the total load of responsibility
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.480]   is really what's correlating with reported happiness or not.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.020]   Now, one very consistent finding
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.680]   that has absolutely stood the test of time.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.720]   That's kind of an interesting one.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.440]   It's a little bit of a pop psychology finding,
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.640]   but I think it points to something interesting
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.160]   that we'll return to again and again
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.600]   is that people tend to report
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.480]   feeling lower levels of happiness,
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.800]   believe it or not, on their birthday.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.280]   And the argument for why this is is the following,
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.920]   that typically we go through our year
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.560]   not comparing ourselves to our peers terribly much.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.380]   We might do that a little bit more
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.540]   when we're in elementary school, high school, et cetera,
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.040]   when we're sort of age match, maybe even college as well.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.360]   But an evaluation of ourselves to our age match peers
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.000]   is not typically something that we do on a daily basis.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.320]   Whereas on our birthday,
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.060]   we get a snapshot of where we are in the arc of time,
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.640]   or at least in our life.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.280]   And many people report feeling rather low on their birthday
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.900]   because they use that as a benchmark or a window
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.600]   into the things that they have not accomplished,
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.780]   the things that despite being age blank,
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.580]   they still haven't accomplished.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.800]   And so that's interesting
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.780]   because of what it really points to is two things.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.140]   One, the extent to which much of our feelings of happiness
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.980]   are relative, in particular relative to our peers.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:37.740]   So there's that social aspect again.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.500]   And the fact that most of the time
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.260]   we are not very good at orienting ourselves
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.660]   in the longer arc of time.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.940]   We're pretty good at knowing where we are
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.580]   in the arc of a day or the arc of a week
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.540]   or the arc of a month or even a year,
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.040]   but that most of us are not very good at reflecting
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.060]   on where we are in our life arc.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.520]   And of course, most of us don't know
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.180]   how long we will live anyway,
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.940]   but we do have some general sense.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.420]   I mean, very few people live past the age of 100.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.060]   Many people live to be 70 or 80.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.540]   And again, lifespan is extending
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.140]   as far as we know from year to year.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.380]   But in general, people report that on their birthdays,
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:19.220]   and I should say these are for birthdays aged 25 or later,
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.920]   at least in the studies I was able to access, right?
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.560]   I don't think that a lot of three-year-olds
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.860]   sit around comparing themselves to other three-year-olds
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.780]   and how well they're doing or 12-year-olds.
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.700]   You can imagine some people might do that at 18, et cetera.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.500]   But it's really by the mid 20s
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.000]   that people start evaluating themselves to their peers
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.160]   in terms of life progression and so-called milestones.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.160]   It's been argued that that's one of the reasons
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.900]   why people report lower affect,
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.480]   lower levels of happiness on their birthday,
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.880]   something that's a little bit counterintuitive.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.720]   And of course, there are things
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.940]   that are anti-correlated with happiness.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.140]   I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a few of these.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.860]   That's longitudinal study.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.640]   The Harvard Happiness Project has reported, for instance,
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.340]   that people that are chronic smokers of nicotine
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.060]   and chronic consumers of alcohol,
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.800]   in particular alcoholics,
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.560]   that is people who suffer from alcoholism
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.620]   or what's sometimes called alcohol use disorder,
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.220]   that is strongly anti-correlated with happiness.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.340]   And I should also mention that the family members
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.700]   and in particular, the romantic partners of people
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:20.260]   who are chronic smokers and the partners of people
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.840]   who are chronic alcohol users
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.740]   often will report lower levels of happiness,
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.200]   especially if they themselves are not chronic smokers
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.380]   or regular consumers of alcohol.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.020]   So we've done episodes on nicotine in particular,
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:36.700]   and that touched on smoking, of course,
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.340]   and we've done an episode on alcohol
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.700]   and the effects of alcohol on health.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.960]   Again, you can find those at hubermanlab.com.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:47.020]   This study from the Harvard Happiness Project
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.080]   really has strong data supporting the fact
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.780]   that avoiding being a nicotine smoker, right?
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.900]   There are positive health effects of nicotine
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.660]   that are discussed in the episode on nicotine,
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.020]   but smoking nicotine in particular is counterproductive
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.260]   for people's at least self-reported happiness
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.500]   and certainly overall health.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.900]   I think there's zero question
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.900]   that smoking increases cancers of different kinds
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.660]   and that alcohol consumption,
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.080]   in particular alcohol consumption
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.420]   beyond two drinks per week,
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.820]   two drinks being the typical volume of a beer,
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:21.060]   a glass of wine or a cocktail, et cetera,
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.600]   is detrimental for various aspects of health.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.000]   And of course, there are other things that you could imagine
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.100]   would relate to a lack of happiness.
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:32.460]   For instance, a major trauma, physical or emotional trauma.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.620]   That could include the loss of a major relationship,
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.960]   a death of a close one,
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:40.300]   being the victim of a violent crime and things of that sort.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:44.220]   And yet it's been argued, in fact strongly argued,
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:47.980]   that when you look at people's levels of happiness
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:52.980]   after a trauma, that if you wait about a year or so,
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.700]   sometimes even as short as three months after a trauma,
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.440]   that people's self-reported levels of happiness
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.480]   are not significantly lower
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.520]   than they were prior to the trauma.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.120]   Now, I very much want to highlight, underline,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.980]   and bold and asterisk that statement
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.000]   as one that we really need to explore carefully
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.480]   because there are other data
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.840]   that strongly point to the fact that major life traumas
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.320]   can severely disrupt one's sense of happiness and wellbeing.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.200]   And I think as long as we're going to have this discussion,
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.880]   we should point to a useful definition of trauma.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.800]   And the definition that I'll paraphrase
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.160]   is one that was supplied by a former guest
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.480]   on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conte,
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.640]   who's a psychiatrist who's written a book called "Trauma."
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.000]   I personally think it's the best book on trauma
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.440]   and tools for alleviating trauma.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.500]   It's incredibly thorough, easy to read, and well-informed.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.920]   And here, again, I'm paraphrasing,
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.380]   but Dr. Conte describes trauma
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.760]   as something that fundamentally changes
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.600]   the way that our brain and body function
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.620]   in a way that makes other aspects of living more challenging.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.940]   Again, an event, either emotional or physical or both,
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.620]   that fundamentally changes the way that our brain
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:11.620]   and/or body, our nervous system and other organs function
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:15.880]   in a way that prevents us from enjoying daily activities.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.800]   And that could even be ongoing distraction, right?
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.820]   Traumas can create rumination
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.220]   or they can create obsessive thought
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.820]   or they can create dissociation,
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.100]   any number of different things.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.920]   Again, check out that episode with Dr. Paul Conte
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.540]   if you'd like to learn more about trauma
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.440]   and how it manifests.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.980]   But the idea that's been put forth
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.720]   by a number of researchers in the field of happiness
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.080]   that three months after a major trauma,
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.120]   people aren't reporting that they are feeling
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   any less happy than before the trauma,
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.220]   that was surprising to me.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:46.240]   So I went into this literature a bit more deeply.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.640]   One of the basis of that general line of thinking
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.260]   is what I consider now classic and very important
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.640]   and frankly, excellent talk that was given
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.720]   by Professor Dan Gilbert on the science of happiness.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.680]   You can find this on YouTube.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.820]   I say a classic one because it was done some years ago.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.700]   It's received millions of views.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.840]   And one of the points that he makes in that talk,
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.100]   which is grounded in research carried out
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.060]   by his laboratory and other laboratories,
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:16.100]   is that, you know, he poses a question.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:18.780]   He says, you know, let's do a quiz.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.520]   Would you rather be someone who wins the lottery?
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.260]   And he shows a picture of somebody who just won,
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:24.960]   I think it was several hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.620]   in the lottery, or was recently made paraplegic,
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.140]   lost use of their legs.
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:34.240]   And then goes on to state that one year
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.040]   after people have won the lottery,
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.320]   this major, you know, monetary windfall
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.940]   versus have become paraplegic,
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.800]   is that their self-reported levels of happiness
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.620]   are the same, which I think is incredibly surprising.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:50.840]   Now, I heard this and I immediately thought of an experience
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.760]   that I've had where I teach a course
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine on neural regeneration.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.680]   And it's actually a course that I attended some years ago
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.120]   when I was a postdoc at Stanford,
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.960]   so well over a decade ago.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.560]   And we had, excuse me,
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:09.120]   we had an individual come into the course.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.000]   This was an older gentleman.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.480]   So older meaning he was in his early 70s
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.360]   and he had become paraplegic fairly late in life
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.000]   from a cycling accident.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   And he was and is an expert in what it is
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.420]   to become a paraplegic, of course,
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.360]   'cause he had that experience,
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.140]   but also because he spends a lot of his time
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.560]   doing volunteer work with people who have become paraplegic
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.560]   and have become paraplegic at different ages.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.440]   And what he described to me was that the overall outcomes
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.120]   for people that are rendered paraplegic
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.820]   in terms of their mental health and their physical wellbeing
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.100]   and their sort of management of general life skills
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:50.400]   scales with how early they had that injury
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.440]   and how long they had the use of their limbs.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.020]   So it's not straightforward.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:59:00.220]   When I heard this result described by Dr. Dan Gilbert
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:02.440]   that winning the lottery and becoming paraplegic
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.300]   basically don't impact your levels of happiness
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:07.720]   to any different degree.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.240]   When people look back a year later,
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.080]   I was pretty surprised given my experience
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.040]   of hearing this lecture at Stanford.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.080]   So I thought, wow, from what I understand,
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.540]   indeed there are people who are rendered paraplegic
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.960]   and manage that transition very easily.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.240]   It doesn't seem to disrupt their feelings
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.160]   of wellbeing, et cetera.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.400]   But for other people, it can be severely disrupting
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.300]   to their sense of wellbeing and so on and so forth.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.440]   I went back and examined these data
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.520]   and in fact, a subsequent talk,
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.680]   it's actually a podcast that was given
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.240]   by Dr. Dan Gilbert some years later.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.720]   So this would be just a few years ago.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.680]   I think 2019 is a specific date in which it was recorded,
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.920]   but just a few years ago.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.180]   And indeed he corrects himself in that podcast.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:57.160]   What he says is that he misspoke in that earlier talk
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.040]   that the difference in self-reported levels of happiness
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.020]   for those that have been rendered paraplegic
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.620]   versus those who've won the lottery
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.760]   is not as great as one would expect.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.820]   I think most people would expect
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.000]   that being rendered paraplegic
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.200]   would make people far less happy.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.120]   That's the expectation, I think, anyway.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.840]   And that people who would win the lottery,
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.360]   at least for some period of time,
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.220]   would be far happier than they were
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.000]   prior to winning the lottery,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.360]   especially given the tremendous amount of money.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.480]   And again, the fact that money can't buy happiness,
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.360]   but that money does indeed enable the ability
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.520]   to buffer stress provided people
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.080]   were responsible with that money
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.240]   and just didn't blow it or spend it all right away,
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.080]   that they could start to afford things
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:40.920]   that they couldn't afford,
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.800]   not just in terms of luxury items,
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.800]   but also the ability to hire help that would free up time,
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.460]   that would allow them to do anything from travel
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.380]   that they couldn't access before to meditate,
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.520]   if that was something that they didn't have time to do before
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.000]   and so on and so forth.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.600]   So the result, quote unquote,
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.640]   that winners of the lottery and recent paraplegics
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.280]   have the same levels of happiness is actually not true,
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.560]   at least according to the author of the original study.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.760]   Now, what he did not point to
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.440]   is the degree to which that is not true,
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.320]   but he did point to the direction of the result
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.380]   and the fact that people who are rendered paraplegic,
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.800]   in fact, are reporting themselves as less happy
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.500]   than they were prior to their injury,
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.220]   and certainly that their levels of happiness
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.120]   are lower than those that simply won the lottery,
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.200]   hundreds of millions of dollars,
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.900]   which I think is the more intuitive result.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.460]   And so I think it's important to be aware
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.700]   of that discrepancy because it's something
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.380]   that was lost in the communication
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.220]   around those results the first time around.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:40.480]   And indeed, Dan Gilbert is an excellent scientist
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.360]   and was quite good about trying to correct the narrative.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.720]   I myself as a podcaster who puts information on the internet
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.160]   know that the challenges of correcting narratives,
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.020]   especially of things that came out some time ago,
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.800]   we always attempt to do this as best we can,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.920]   but not everyone that saw that first video
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.680]   will necessarily hear the discussion
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.180]   that happened subsequently.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.480]   So my hope is that Dr. Gilbert will interpret
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.860]   me communicating this now,
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.200]   not as an attempt to criticize him,
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.440]   but rather as an attempt to praise his willingness
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.040]   to try and correct the narrative to be more accurate.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.160]   So to be very clear about what this study did
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.680]   and didn't show, and here I'm going to combine these results
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.100]   with other studies that I was able to find
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.840]   that explored similar phenomenon.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.000]   So major trauma, for instance,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.940]   not necessarily becoming paraplegic,
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.800]   but traumas of a different sort, emotional traumas.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.760]   When you look at the whole of those data,
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.160]   at least my read is that when people win the lottery
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.480]   or acquire wealth through inheritance,
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.200]   some form of wealth acquisition that is sudden
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.660]   and that wasn't preceded by a specific effort
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.840]   to gain that wealth, right?
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.320]   Buying a lottery ticket is a pretty quick thing.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.040]   Inheritance is something that you simply get
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.440]   by virtue of who you are, not necessarily by effort.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.440]   Well, that led to increases in self-reported happiness
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.460]   compared to prior to the inheritance of the lottery win,
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.920]   but it wasn't as substantial as you might imagine
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.880]   if you're approaching the notion of happiness
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.180]   simply from, well, more money equals more happiness.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.020]   And while it is true that people
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.680]   who are rendered paraplegic
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.000]   or who undergo psychological traumas
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.400]   or physical traumas of any various kind
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.140]   are and, frankly, are remarkably resilient in many cases,
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.280]   they can still manage to go about life and work
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.840]   and engage in relationships, et cetera,
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.920]   there is a visible decrease in overall levels
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.960]   of happiness and wellbeing, in particular,
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.800]   if the psychological and physical trauma
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.520]   renders their nervous system different in a way
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.000]   that impacts other major areas of life
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.800]   and enjoyment for them.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.800]   And that's certainly true one year out from the trauma.
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.720]   So the point is that we do need to reframe this idea
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.120]   that whether or not you win the lottery
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.560]   or become paraplegic or suffer some major trauma,
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.640]   your levels of happiness are going to be the same
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.200]   three months or a year later.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.760]   I don't think that's accurate.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.480]   And in fact, Dr. Dan Gilbert emphasized
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.240]   that that's not accurate even in that initial study.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.400]   And I think it's an important thing to frame
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.680]   because that's such a popular notion
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.920]   or that that idea combined with the idea
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.600]   that increased earnings don't make us happy
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:27.020]   combined with the idea that we are happy earlier in life,
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.400]   but then as more demands arise in life,
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.360]   we become less happy and then we become happy again.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.800]   And that idea as we already explored
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.920]   is not necessarily true.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.340]   Frankly, I knew a lot of teenagers
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.180]   and people in their early 20s are pretty unhappy
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.440]   who then become happier later
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.580]   as they acquire more resources.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.720]   Sometimes distance, let's be honest,
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.200]   sometimes distance from our family of origin
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.520]   makes us more happy, sometimes less so.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.960]   It's highly individual.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.280]   So I think those general themes
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.340]   that we've heard over and over while they have merit
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.960]   and they certainly stand up in some of the more powerful
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.440]   longitudinal and short-term studies,
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.300]   there is nuance and in some cases,
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.600]   there are now additional data
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.440]   that are causing us to revise those understandings.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.700]   Now, there is an important point
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:09.600]   or I should say the important point
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.460]   that we can really credit Dan Gilbert
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.600]   and others in the field of psychology with
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.760]   and that we owe them a great debt of gratitude for
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.380]   is that we do have far more control
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.240]   over our levels of happiness than we might think.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.200]   And many of the things that reside at that level of control,
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.080]   that is the things that we can do and think and say
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.820]   and access don't come from external things, right?
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.560]   They don't come necessarily
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.360]   from the acquisition of material goods,
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.360]   but rather there are things that we can do
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.900]   that can allow us to so-called synthesize happiness.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.080]   And I think this is one of the great gifts
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.200]   of modern psychology is that Dan Gilbert and others,
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.440]   the Harvard Happiness Project work at Yale and elsewhere,
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.560]   right, there are excellent labs working on happiness
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.600]   all over the US and all over the world, frankly.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.520]   One of the great gifts that they've supplied us
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.400]   in the form of data is that there really are things
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.160]   that we can all do and think and access
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.560]   to allow ourselves to so-called synthesize happiness.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.140]   Now, this notion of synthesizing happiness
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.080]   or synthetic happiness as it's sometimes called
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.200]   can sometimes ruffle people's feathers a bit
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.240]   because people immediately flip to the idea that,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.040]   oh, you're just going to tell me to be grateful
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.040]   for what I have or to just navel gaze
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.960]   or just to imagine that I'm happy.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.640]   But that's really not what synthetic happiness
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.560]   is about at all.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.100]   Synthetic happiness actually has to do
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.320]   with some really important larger principles
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.560]   about the way that our emotional system
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.540]   and the way that the reward systems
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.480]   of our brain really function.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.520]   And they point to important concepts
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.240]   that we're going to now discuss,
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.120]   things like the hedonic set point, for instance,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.480]   or the dopamine system of anticipation of rewards
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.440]   versus receiving rewards.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.600]   Just as a brief insight into that,
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.940]   our anticipation of something positive oftentimes leads
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.600]   to greater increases in the sorts of neurochemicals
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.440]   that support a state of happiness and wellbeing
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.720]   than the actual acquisition of the thing
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.040]   that we're trying to obtain.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.000]   And this goes back to a theme I've discussed a few times
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.960]   before in this podcast,
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.720]   in particular with my colleague
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.600]   at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lemke,
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.880]   who wrote the fabulous book "Dopamine Nation."
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.800]   If you're interested in dopamine and addiction in particular,
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:34.800]   that's a wonderful, clear, and extremely informative read.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.200]   And if you're interested in dopamine more generally,
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.480]   just not just in the states of addiction,
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   but in everyday life and in pursuit and motivation,
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.740]   "The Molecule of More" is an excellent book related to that.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.600]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.680]   we have this episode on dopamine motivation and drive.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.680]   The notion of synthetic happiness is not simply
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.720]   about imagining happiness or thinking about happiness
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.320]   or anticipating happiness.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.280]   To some extent it is,
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.440]   but it relates to a number of other important themes,
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.760]   but it is grounded very thoroughly
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.140]   in the neurobiology of dopamine rewards.
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.960]   And I'll talk about some of that neurobiology
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.120]   in a few moments.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.640]   But I want to take a couple of minutes
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.840]   and talk about what synthetic happiness is
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.720]   and what some of the conditions are
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.680]   for allowing us to access the state
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.560]   of so-called synthetic happiness.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.640]   And I want to point out at the outset
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.200]   that synthetic happiness,
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.880]   while it might sound synthetic, AKA false,
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.040]   it's anything but.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.400]   It actually turns out to be among the more
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.820]   and perhaps the more potent form of happiness
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.120]   that we can all access.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.020]   And this is where themes related to our control
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.720]   over our own internal state
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.040]   really become not only valid, but very powerful.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.460]   So for instance, Dr. Dan Gilbert and others
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.800]   have explored how opportunity and choice,
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.740]   that is freedom, can and can't lead to states of happiness.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.760]   And the results of those studies are very solid
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.020]   and frankly, very surprising
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.540]   until you understand the results.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.860]   And once you do,
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.840]   I think you will immediately see areas of your own life
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.180]   that you can start to access more happiness.
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.360]   Again, genuine happiness simply by framing certain choices
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.740]   in a particular way and maybe even by eliminating choices.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.680]   Now I'd like to focus on the research aimed at understanding
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.420]   what increases our levels of happiness.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.800]   And I'd like to frame this
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.680]   under the umbrella of two major themes.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.700]   The first theme is so-called natural happiness.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.680]   Natural happiness is the sort of happiness
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.800]   that most of us are familiar with.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   So the kind of happiness that we expect to have
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.460]   if we, for instance, complete a degree,
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.520]   hopefully a degree in a topic meaningful
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.520]   and interesting to us, but a degree nonetheless,
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.620]   or we find a mate,
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.040]   hopefully a mate that we enjoy spending time with,
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.120]   or for instance, making a certain income
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.540]   or finding work that we enjoy on a regular basis.
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.920]   All of those are forms of happiness
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.580]   that from a very early time in development,
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.960]   we are taught exist.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.520]   For instance, even when we are very young,
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.160]   we are told that our birthday is coming
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.520]   and that we are going to get presents
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.280]   and those presents are going to be focused on knowledge
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.400]   of things that we already enjoy.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.960]   So if you're a little kid and you like trucks
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.220]   or you're a little kid and you like dolls,
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.160]   you can sort of expect that those gifts
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.760]   will bring you some level of joy or happiness.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.600]   And while that's a small child example,
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.960]   that general notion of natural happiness
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.940]   is of course one that persists into adolescence,
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.640]   into young adulthood and into adulthood.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.040]   And we quite understandably come to associate
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.120]   this feeling of joy or happiness
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.960]   with the receiving of things or the acquisition of things,
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.960]   whether by effort, by gift, by inheritance
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.240]   or some other form, okay?
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.540]   So that's natural happiness.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:48.560]   And yet, as I mentioned a little bit earlier,
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.400]   there's also this notion of synthetic happiness.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.760]   And some of the more interesting and exciting research
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.600]   in the fields of psychology and in fact neuroscience
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.800]   point to this idea of synthetic happiness
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.680]   as at least as powerful a source of happiness
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.460]   as natural happiness.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.420]   Again, at least as powerful and perhaps even more powerful.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.980]   And of course, one has to take a slightly different view
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.420]   of what happiness is in order to accept this idea
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.140]   that we can create happiness for ourselves.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.200]   But that doesn't mean that the whole notion
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.700]   of synthetic happiness is merely a passive one
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.380]   where all we do is sit back and imagine being happy
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.720]   and then we are happy.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.880]   For better or for worse, our nervous systems
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.180]   and our neurochemistry simply don't work that way.
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.560]   In fact, synthetic happiness has almost always
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.900]   been understood as something that we have to put
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.000]   some effort toward achieving.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.360]   But, and this is an important thing to point out,
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.600]   synthetic happiness also requires that certain situational
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.920]   or environmental conditions be met.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.100]   A good example of this is some of the work
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.720]   by Jillian Mandich, or I should say Dr. Jillian Mandich,
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.160]   who's done some interesting work on the conditions
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.900]   for creating happiness within our mind
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.400]   and in our overall state of being.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.220]   And she's been involved in a number of different studies,
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.840]   but one of the ones that I found particularly interesting
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.200]   is one in which they explored different types of music
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.400]   and other aspects of environmental settings.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.360]   So you bring subjects to the laboratory,
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.880]   play them different types of music.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.160]   There are in fact, certain aspects of music
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.280]   that can create different states of mind,
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.860]   sadness, happiness, anticipation.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.960]   In fact, there are certain patterns of music
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.880]   that can reliably induce anticipation
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.420]   of the fear and anxiety based type.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:37.120]   So for instance, think the movie "Jaws."
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.400]   If you recall, for those of you that have seen "Jaws,"
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.960]   there's this ongoing theme music.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.640]   Anytime the shark might be present in the water
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.800]   or in a given scene, that essentially goes...
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.840]   Now for the musicians out there,
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.960]   this has basis in things like tritones
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.400]   and things that are understood from the mathematics
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.560]   and the musical side, and from the neuroscience side
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.960]   are known to create a neural state of anticipation.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.800]   Yeah, a neural state of anticipation
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.040]   and not necessarily a positive one.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.160]   And indeed, there are other patterns of music
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.640]   that involve uptones.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.760]   Think some of the music that's typically been used
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.160]   in cartoons of various sorts.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.580]   There's a long history of this.
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.220]   Indeed, there's a whole literature of psychological
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.800]   and now even a smaller but still interesting literature
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.280]   on the neuroscience of how certain patterns of music
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.960]   can induce a state of joy
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.200]   and joyful anticipation in particular.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.840]   A lot of those patterns of music are incorporated
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.760]   into so-called happy cartoons and Disney movies
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.240]   and things of that sort.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.920]   In any case, Dr. Mandich and others have explored
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.720]   how music in particular but other features
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.160]   of the environment can or cannot induce states of happiness.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.220]   And the basic takeaway from those studies
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:58.220]   is that while having a certain environmental sound,
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:03.840]   musical tone or visual feature to a given space, a room,
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.040]   is necessary for a state of happiness,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.720]   it is not alone sufficient.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.100]   What is required is that individuals not only be placed
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.860]   into an environment that contains music or visual items
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.160]   or a combination of music and visual items
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.720]   that can induce states of joy or happiness
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.660]   or positive anticipation,
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.600]   but that they also are given some sort of instruction
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.240]   or instruction manual as to how to synthesize happiness
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.620]   inside of that environment.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.920]   This is important because what this says
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.980]   is that our ability to create states of happiness
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.120]   is dependent on our environment
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.080]   but also requires effort from us.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.520]   That also makes sense as to why
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.400]   when we are under conditions of deprivation,
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   so it could be social deprivation or financial deprivation,
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.440]   or even for people that are very sensitive to weather,
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.520]   there are a certain number of individuals,
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.560]   about 30% of people who report feeling very, very low
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.360]   under conditions where the sky is overcast,
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.840]   especially if it's been overcast for a number of days,
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.760]   the so-called seasonal affective depression.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.980]   Those individuals, by the way,
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.440]   can often receive tremendous benefits
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.740]   in terms of elevating their mood
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.340]   if they make an effort to get sunlight
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.080]   and if they can't get sunlight, artificial light
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.520]   of the sort that we talked about earlier.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.920]   But in any case, there are a number of people
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.520]   that are profoundly negatively influenced
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:33.040]   by the lack of positive visual and auditory cues
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.200]   in their environment.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.140]   But for most people, we are in a,
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.240]   what I would call a dynamic relationship
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.400]   with our environment.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.200]   Our environment has an effect on our mood,
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.900]   but the research indicates that we also need to make
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.540]   some sort of effort toward being happy.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:50.740]   Now, effort toward being happy is a very vague term,
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.080]   so let's better define what that is.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.640]   In the case of Dr. Mandich's work,
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:58.240]   this took the form of doing so-called happiness
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.960]   inventories, right?
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.280]   That can be focusing on things that one is grateful for,
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.900]   things that they particularly enjoy.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.400]   This is somewhat of a gratitude type practice,
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.180]   but includes some other features as well
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:14.000]   that are more focused on the things that bring you meaning
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.500]   and actually engaging in the things
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.340]   that bring you meaning.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.560]   So if you're trying to think about
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.120]   how to improve your levels of happiness,
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.500]   what this research essentially says is
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.280]   that you would be smart to try
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.600]   and adjust your home environment,
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:27.800]   adjust your work environment
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.280]   so that it is cheerful to you.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.320]   Maybe that means a plant.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.560]   For me in my laboratory,
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.960]   one of the things that was really critical
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.280]   that I had as a postdoc and in my own laboratory
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.960]   when I first started my lab was I love aquaria,
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.320]   so I had multiple fish tanks.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.320]   In fact, people in my laboratory
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.320]   were always rolling their eyes.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.840]   Why do we have to have all these fish tanks
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.700]   with all these, I like freshwater tanks,
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.560]   not saltwater tanks for reasons
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.240]   that aren't interesting for this discussion,
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.040]   but freshwater tanks with discus fish, for instance,
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.000]   to me are just beautiful.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:57.840]   They make me happy.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.400]   I just enjoy them.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.200]   Music is a complicated thing in laboratories
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.440]   because it's a shared space,
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.120]   so headphones are the general requirement,
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.960]   but having either silence, if you love silence,
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.540]   and I happen to like working in silence
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.080]   or listening to certain forms of music,
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.520]   I do also use the 40 hertz binaural beats,
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.100]   or I particularly like listening to Glenn Gould
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.680]   while I work or listening to whale song,
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.620]   believe it or not, while I work,
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.640]   because it doesn't have any structure that I can follow.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.860]   I don't speak whale, and so I can't follow,
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.640]   but it fills the space in a way that I find pleasant,
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.820]   and I've put substantial amounts of effort
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:34.160]   into making my laboratory spaces and my office spaces,
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.280]   my work spaces, nice places to be.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.120]   Now, I had no knowledge of this work
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.080]   from Dr. Mandich and others at the time when I did that,
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.160]   but what I found was that over the years,
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.200]   I was challenged in maintaining a kind of elevated mood
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.440]   while working in a laboratory,
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.240]   not because I didn't thoroughly enjoy the work.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.840]   I love doing experiments with my hands,
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.320]   and I loved being in lab,
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.360]   but at least the labs that I was in
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.500]   as a graduate student and postdoc, there were no windows,
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.420]   so I wasn't getting adequate sunshine.
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.660]   The windows that we didn't have didn't open,
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.300]   so I wasn't getting a lot of fresh air,
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.460]   and so on and so forth.
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.800]   So I've personally found it very valuable
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.780]   to create an environment both at work and at home
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.700]   that I find aesthetically pleasant,
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.020]   at least in some way or another,
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.100]   and I realize people have varying levels of control
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.780]   over their aesthetic environment.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.360]   Certainly the auditory environment can be controlled
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.740]   nowadays through the use of headphones
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:24.980]   if you're allowed to use those.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.340]   So for instance, using music or using background sound
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.280]   that you find very pleasant,
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.580]   combined with a concerted effort on your part
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:37.300]   to create states of happiness
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.640]   by hopefully doing work that's meaningful to you,
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.220]   or at least is leading to meaningful outcomes,
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.340]   we'll talk a little bit more about that,
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.840]   but these happiness inventories also turn out
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.820]   to be interesting and important sources
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.340]   of creating so-called synthetic happiness,
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.740]   and we will also talk about other ways
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.860]   that one can create elevated levels of synthetic happiness.
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.140]   And I realized the word synthetic
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:00.400]   probably draws up connotations of false happiness
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.740]   or contrived happiness.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.860]   I wish instead of calling it synthetic happiness,
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.220]   they had called it self-created or self-directed happiness
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.380]   or something of that sort,
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:10.580]   'cause then it wouldn't sound as false
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.080]   because it's simply not false.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.620]   It leads to the same, as far as we know,
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:18.200]   identical neurochemical and psychological states of happiness
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.080]   as natural happiness,
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.380]   and might even be more persistent than natural happiness.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.680]   It certainly is more under our control.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.420]   But the key point is that environment
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:31.420]   and self-directed work at being happy are both important,
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.380]   and they interact with one another.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.180]   So if you're somebody who has a hard time
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:38.100]   synthesizing happiness through any of the methods
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.340]   that we talk about today,
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.420]   don't consider yourself deficient.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:44.720]   It could very well be that the environment that you're in,
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.420]   social environment or physical environment
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:47.580]   or auditory environment,
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.140]   is simply not conducive to synthesizing happiness.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.420]   And for that reason, I think the work of Gillian Mandich
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.780]   and colleagues and others in the field
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.940]   is tremendously important
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:59.460]   because it removes us from this pressure
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.100]   to just synthesize happiness
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:03.300]   from within despite our circumstances.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.800]   I think many of us have heard of the incredible stories
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.940]   of people like Viktor Frankl or Nelson Mandela,
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.620]   who were stripped of their freedom
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.220]   and yet managed to maintain
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.120]   some sense of positive anticipation,
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.380]   or at least some sense of identity
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.340]   that allowed them to still access forms of happiness.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.580]   Those are highly unique situations, of course,
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.880]   and they speak to the power of the human psyche
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.380]   for synthesizing happiness
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.500]   and certainly for synthesizing a sense
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.720]   that there might be a future and to live into that future,
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.380]   in their cases, incredibly impressive ways.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.620]   But I think for most everybody,
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.700]   the environment that we're in
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.060]   has a powerful impact on our mood
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.180]   and some people more than others.
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.620]   I know people that are perfectly happy with blank walls,
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.580]   no pictures on the walls.
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:49.380]   Other people benefit tremendously from having photos
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.680]   or plants in their environment and so on.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.100]   You really have to determine what's needed for you
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.260]   and do your best to try and place those things
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.100]   into your environment,
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.060]   or rather place yourself into an environment
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.340]   that is conducive to you synthesizing your happiness.
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.640]   In fact, the powerful interaction between our environment
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:09.920]   and our own ability to generate certain kinds of emotions
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.800]   is well-established, not just for happiness,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.040]   but for things like gratitude.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.500]   So for instance, there's a classic study from AIMS, A-M-E-S,
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.540]   in 2004, that was focused on gratitude.
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.220]   And we've had an episode on gratitude before.
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:24.780]   The basic takeaway of that episode
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:28.380]   is that it turns out receiving gratitude
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.740]   is a more powerful stimulus
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.780]   for the release of neurochemicals
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.140]   and activation of brain areas
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.180]   associated with so-called pro-social behaviors
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:40.440]   and feelings of wellbeing, including happiness,
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.820]   but also observing stories in the form of movies or books
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.100]   or other narratives of other people receiving help
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.700]   is also a very powerful stimulus for gratitude.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.420]   Also, giving gratitude is very powerful,
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.820]   but not as powerful as receiving gratitude,
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.940]   at least that's what the research says,
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.580]   or observing powerful exchanges of gratitude
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.380]   between other individuals.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.060]   What the study from AIMS showed
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:05.460]   is that gratitude as a state of mind and as an emotion
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:08.220]   does not exist in a vacuum.
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.800]   It's not independent of our surroundings.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.640]   So for instance,
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.140]   just writing down all the things you're grateful for
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.180]   while it has some positive impact,
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.820]   the impact of that or receiving gratitude
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:22.460]   or observing gratitude is far more potent, right?
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:25.500]   Bigger increases in happiness and feelings of wellbeing
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.660]   and indeed neurochemicals and activation of brain areas
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:30.300]   associated with happiness and wellbeing
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.980]   when there's a reciprocity,
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:35.220]   when the person receiving understands something
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.660]   about the person that's giving to them
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.700]   and understands that the person is giving genuinely,
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.580]   for instance.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.020]   So there's an environmental interaction.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.040]   It's not just about receiving,
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.020]   it's receiving from somebody that you know genuinely
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.340]   wants to give.
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:49.580]   And likewise for the giver in that equation,
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.080]   the feelings of wellbeing are far greater
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.080]   when the person receiving whatever it is,
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.340]   money, food, assistance in some form or another,
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:01.020]   it could be physical assistance, et cetera,
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.960]   when the giver has knowledge that the person receiving it
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.080]   genuinely needed the thing that they are receiving.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.720]   So the important finding within the research again and again
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.920]   is that happiness doesn't exist in a vacuum.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.940]   It's partially our own responsibility
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.300]   to synthesize happiness.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.740]   And I was told that many times in your life,
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:18.140]   happiness is in your head.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.140]   Well, yes, indeed it's in your head,
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.460]   but it's also dependent on interactions
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.300]   with your environment,
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.100]   physical environment and social environment and so on.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.980]   Likewise, gratitude is something that we can create
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.460]   inside of us, right?
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:33.220]   Through gratitude lists and appreciation,
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.200]   or we can give both powerful sources
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:40.300]   of evoking neurochemical changes associated with gratitude
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.440]   and happiness and wellbeing,
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.200]   but it too doesn't exist in a vacuum.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.660]   There's a much greater positive effect
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:51.000]   when we have knowledge about why the giver
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   is giving us something,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.340]   or that the person receiving something
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.220]   is going to benefit tremendously from receiving it.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.900]   So I'm highlighting this because I think that
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.620]   when we hear about synthetic happiness,
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:05.600]   there's a kind of automatic erasing of context
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.780]   that tends to occur.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:10.640]   And in fact, if you were to peruse the various videos
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.580]   online or papers that exist on PubMed
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:16.420]   around happiness and synthetic happiness in particular,
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.420]   you would come away with the impression
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.020]   that synthetic happiness is just something
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.340]   that we're supposed to snap our fingers and access,
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.940]   or perhaps do very specific things in access.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.580]   But while that is true, context really matters.
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:30.420]   And I think that's an important point,
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:34.140]   much in the same way that the point needs to be made
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.260]   that while money doesn't buy happiness,
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:39.340]   money can buffer stress and certainly offer opportunities
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:42.100]   that can provide opportunities for more happiness.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.980]   So I think we are starting to arrive at a general theme here
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.620]   which is that nothing related to our mood
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.140]   exists in isolation.
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:51.300]   And in fact, that leads me to a discussion
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:54.700]   of one of the major scientific findings
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.420]   in the realm of what sorts of mindsets and behaviors
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:00.080]   can in fact lead to happiness.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.020]   And this is a paper that was published in 2008.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.540]   And even though that might seem like a while ago,
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.040]   it forms the basis for a large amount of literature
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:07.980]   that followed.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:09.300]   It's a very interesting literature.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.980]   This is work from Elizabeth Dunn and colleagues
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.920]   and was published in the journal Science,
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.580]   which again is one of the sort of three apex journals,
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:21.660]   Nature Science, Cell, I always say is sort of the Super Bowl
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.060]   NBA Championships and Stanley Cup of Scientific Publishing.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.260]   Very, very stringent in terms of the number of papers
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.140]   they let in, very few that is.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:32.020]   And the title of this paper makes fairly obvious
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.200]   what the paper is about.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.180]   The title of the paper is "Spending Money on Others
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:37.640]   Promotes Happiness."
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.980]   And I know a number of you probably hear that title
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.340]   and think, oh boy, here we go.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:43.940]   He's going to tell us that giving away all our money
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:46.600]   is going to make us happier than receiving money.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.960]   And I promise you that is not what I'm going to tell you.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.060]   But nonetheless, this is a very interesting study.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.660]   And it's one that I think that we really
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:54.440]   ought to pay attention to.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.440]   Because what the study is based on is the fact that income,
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:03.600]   provided one's income meets a certain level of basic needs,
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.760]   indeed has been shown to have only a weak effect
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.240]   on overall happiness.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.400]   So quoting from the paper in the first paragraph,
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.100]   "Income has a reliable but surprisingly weak effect
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.440]   on happiness within nations."
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.060]   Within nations just mean they looked at this
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.400]   in not just the United States,
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.000]   but a number of other places as well.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.220]   Particularly once basic needs are met.
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.960]   Okay, so if that's the case,
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.100]   then what aspects of money and having money
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.300]   are related to happiness?
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.060]   Certainly there are people who have a lot of money
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.180]   who are very happy.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.840]   Certainly there are people who have very little money
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.920]   who are very happy.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.680]   And of course the reverse is also true.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.960]   There are plenty of people who don't have very much money
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.020]   who are unhappy.
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:45.220]   And in fact, there are people who have a lot of money
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.100]   who are very unhappy.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.880]   A point that whenever it's made,
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:53.680]   often leaps those with less money to kind of roll their eyes
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.460]   because the assumption is more money
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.180]   does increase happiness.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.100]   And in fact, it doesn't.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:00.820]   And later we'll get back to this idea
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:05.540]   of whether or how one acquired their money
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.220]   has any impact on whether or not
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.860]   that money increases their happiness or not.
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.820]   Okay, let's kind of earmark that for later.
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.580]   In the meantime, let's talk a little bit more
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.420]   about the findings in this paper.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.180]   This paper is interesting because what it did
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.640]   is it explored something called prosocial spending.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.240]   Prosocial spending is a phenomenon where people
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.920]   are taking a certain portion of their income
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.120]   and they are giving it to others,
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.800]   often for causes or for things that they think
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.960]   are important to see happen in the world
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.800]   or change in the world.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.040]   That could be a hungry individual having access to food
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.560]   or medical care.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.280]   It could be for environmental causes.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.280]   It could be for animal wellness.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.780]   It could be for any number of different things.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.780]   It could even be giving somebody money
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:52.240]   so that they can buy themselves a gift
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:56.020]   or giving somebody money and not having any, excuse me,
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.880]   understanding or expectation of what they're going to do
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.280]   with the money, okay?
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.280]   Again, one of the central themes around gratitude
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:06.720]   is that while receiving is great,
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.160]   giving is also great in terms of increasing sense
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.760]   of wellbeing.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.880]   And one of the more important features to that
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.680]   is when we give either in the form of words
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.280]   or in the form of resources,
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.640]   knowledge that the person receiving benefits from that
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.640]   in some real way greatly increases the chance
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.720]   that there's an increase in happiness for the giver
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.120]   as well as the receiver.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.640]   Again, that's a note about gratitude,
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.540]   but not an insignificant one as it relates to this study.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.960]   So what this study found was that higher pro-social spending
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.320]   was associated with significantly greater happiness.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.200]   This was a very statistically significant effect.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.680]   And they found that the effects of income
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.440]   and pro-social spending were independent
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.700]   and similar in magnitude, okay?
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.880]   Independent and similar in magnitude.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.640]   I'll explain what that means for those of you
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.840]   that might be confused by that statement in just a moment.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:05.180]   Whereas "personal spending remained unrelated to happiness."
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.080]   So what this study basically found was
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.160]   if people are allotted a certain amount of money
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.160]   to give away and want to adjust for overall income, right?
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.400]   And this is important because you can imagine
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.360]   that for some individual giving away $2,000
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.560]   might represent a significant portion
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.600]   of their yearly or monthly income.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.680]   And for another individual,
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.300]   it might represent a tiny fraction of their income.
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.800]   But when you adjust for income level,
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.400]   what you find is that people who gave away money
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.060]   benefited tremendously in terms
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:44.480]   of their own increase in happiness.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.840]   In fact, "employees who devoted more of their bonuses
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.080]   to pro-social spending," that is giving away more money,
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.200]   "experienced greater happiness after receiving the bonus
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.280]   and the manner in which they spent that bonus
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.580]   was a more important predictor of their happiness
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:59.760]   than the size of the bonus itself."
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.320]   This was an actual experiment they ran
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:04.300]   with real income, real money.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.360]   I'm going to read that again just to make sure it hits home
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.020]   because I found this to be really impactful.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:14.120]   "Employees who devoted a greater fraction of their bonus
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:18.460]   to pro-social spending," that is giving away money to others,
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:21.860]   "experienced greater happiness after receiving the bonus
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:23.900]   and the manner in which they spent that bonus
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:26.100]   was a more important predictor of their happiness
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.900]   than the size of the bonus itself."
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.880]   So the actual bonus, the receiving of the money,
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.760]   led to greater increases in happiness if they gave it away.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.120]   And the act of giving it away itself
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.440]   led to greater increases in happiness
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.400]   than receiving the bonus.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.720]   So it's a twofer, as you might say.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.700]   So the takeaway from this study and studies like it,
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:51.640]   I think it's pretty obvious that to the extent that we can,
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.980]   and again, when I say to the extent that we can,
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:57.520]   this means whatever percentage of our own income
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.760]   that we can afford to give away,
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.880]   or if we don't have income,
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.960]   the percentage of our effort, right?
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.360]   I mean, this was about money, but it's also about effort.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.700]   We can help others, right?
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:09.760]   You can serve in food kitchens.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.960]   You can do community gardening.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.360]   You can pick up trash.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.160]   You can do any number of things.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.480]   You can assist a neighbor with childcare
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:20.600]   or assist a neighbor who is physically less able
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.960]   to retrieve their paper, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.720]   The point is that giving resources,
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.220]   certainly in the form of money,
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:32.160]   but also in the form of effort and time,
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.240]   is immensely beneficial for synthesizing our own happiness,
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.400]   that is, for the giver, us,
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.320]   to increase our levels of happiness.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.860]   But the degree of an increase in our own happiness
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:46.600]   is proportional in some way
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.480]   to the extent to which the person receiving
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.680]   actually needed that help and registers that help.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.320]   Excellent research also points to the fact
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.480]   that another potent way to synthesize happiness,
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:02.360]   that is to create genuine states of happiness in ourselves,
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.700]   is to leverage the so-called focus system,
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.120]   or rather, I should say,
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:11.120]   to de-emphasize the tendency of our minds to wander.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.480]   There's an excellent paper on this
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.040]   also published in the journal "Science."
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.340]   This is now a classic paper.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:17.760]   I talked a little bit about it in the episode on meditation,
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.340]   but for those of you that did
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:21.640]   or perhaps didn't hear that episode,
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.340]   I just want to briefly touch on a few aspects of the paper.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:27.960]   And in particular, a few aspects of the paper
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.760]   that I didn't talk about previously.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.560]   And the title of this paper, again,
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.800]   is very straightforward
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.680]   in terms of telling you what it's about.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:38.520]   And that is "A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind"
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.600]   by Killingsworth and Gilbert.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.600]   This paper was published in "Science" in 2010,
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.320]   and we will provide a link to the paper.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.600]   This is frankly a very interesting paper.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.880]   This paper involved several thousand subjects,
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.440]   or I should say 2,250 adult subjects.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.000]   And what they were able to do
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.380]   was to contact these subjects
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:58.080]   while they were going about living their daily lives
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.120]   and ask them both what they were doing
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.760]   and what they were feeling.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.560]   There were some additional questions that they asked them,
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.960]   but they were able to establish
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.520]   whether or not people were watching television
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:11.680]   or doing housework or working on a home computer
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.660]   or resting or listening to music, et cetera,
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:15.800]   in their natural environment.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.680]   So this is outside the laboratory.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.360]   And they were able to assess
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:25.220]   to what extent those people were happy or unhappy or neutral
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.480]   or had some other emotional state
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:28.920]   at the time when they were engaging
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.560]   in any number of different activities.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.320]   And they assessed whether or not those individuals
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.560]   were also focused on or focused away
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.120]   from whatever activity they were engaging in.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.980]   And the takeaways from this study are many,
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:43.980]   but for sake of today's discussion,
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.440]   what I think is especially interesting
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.240]   is that regardless of whether or not
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.340]   people were engaging in activities that they enjoyed or not,
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.780]   the tendency for their mind to wander from an activity
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:00.080]   predicted lower levels of happiness
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.420]   than if they tended to be focused
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:03.780]   on the activity they were engaged in.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:06.340]   Now, that itself should be surprising.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.960]   I mean, what that says is that
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.400]   even if somebody was engaged in an activity
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.960]   like cleaning their house or doing homework
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.580]   or reading something that they weren't enjoying,
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.080]   if they were focused on what they were doing,
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.080]   they tended to report as happier
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.620]   than if their mind was drifting elsewhere.
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:25.960]   Now, this also points to the idea that perhaps
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.000]   our minds drift to unpleasant thoughts
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.060]   more than pleasant thoughts,
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:31.460]   but they also address that in the study.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.900]   The point I'd like to make here is quote,
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.620]   "Although people's minds were more likely
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.780]   "to wander to pleasant topics than to unpleasant topics,"
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:40.640]   and there the difference is pretty significant.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.160]   People's minds tended to wander to pleasant topics
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.040]   about 43% of the time as opposed to unpleasant topics
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.000]   about 27% of the time,
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.040]   or to neutral topics in the remaining 31% of the samples.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.640]   "People were no happier when thinking about pleasant topics
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.420]   "than about their current activity."
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:01.640]   Think about that.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.580]   "People were no happier than when thinking
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:06.000]   "about pleasant things than their current activity.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.620]   "In fact, the mere focus on what they were doing
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.900]   "was more powerful than anything else,
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:15.200]   "even if they didn't enjoy what they were doing."
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.760]   So they go on here to say, quote,
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.940]   "Although negative moods are known to cause mind wandering,
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.500]   "analysis strongly suggested that mind wandering
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.900]   "was generally the cause," the cause,
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:28.140]   "and not merely the consequence of unhappiness."
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.900]   And so there are a lot of aspects of this study
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.420]   that are worth going into,
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:33.460]   but the major takeaway,
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:36.220]   or the one that perhaps we should all be most concerned with
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:39.180]   is that when we are not focused on what we are doing,
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.200]   we tend to be far less happy
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.340]   than when we are focused on what we were doing,
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:44.340]   even if what we were doing
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.540]   is something that we don't deem very pleasant.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.220]   And certainly if we are engaged in something
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:50.820]   that we consider very pleasant and we are very focused on,
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.900]   well, then our levels of happiness are the highest.
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:54.260]   That's sort of obvious.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.220]   But what this really speaks to
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:36:00.340]   is the tremendous power of building our ability
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:01.560]   to focus on what we're doing
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.660]   and to stay present to what we are doing.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:05.120]   Now, this whole notion of staying present
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.260]   is one that itself is a little bit complicated.
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.740]   And in the episode on meditation,
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:11.180]   I talked a little bit about whether or not it's beneficial
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:14.660]   to be present to our internal state,
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.700]   or that is our interoceptive state,
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.720]   our feelings of our heart rate
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.400]   and how full or empty our gut feels,
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.320]   or our state of being from our skin inward,
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.880]   or whether or not we should focus on being present
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.300]   to things in our immediate surroundings,
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:33.140]   both our versions of being "present," as you can imagine.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:35.960]   But in the one case, we're focused internally,
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.020]   in the other, we're focused externally.
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:39.000]   And of course, most of the time,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.480]   it's some combination of the two.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.760]   But what this study really says
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.800]   is that any practice that can powerfully impact our ability
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.680]   to remain present in the activity we are engaged in,
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.100]   that could even be a phone call,
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.060]   could be texting for that matter,
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:54.940]   could be social media for that matter, right?
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.980]   We're not placing judgment on the activity here.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:58.660]   In fact, what we're really talking about
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.140]   is the enormous happiness increasing value
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:03.820]   of being present to what we're doing
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:06.060]   regardless of what we are doing.
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:08.200]   And the practice that's known to be beneficial
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:12.640]   for increasing our ability to focus is, among other things,
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.220]   a short meditation practice.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.180]   In fact, work from Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.180]   Again, Wendy has been a guest on this podcast.
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:23.780]   Her laboratory has shown that even a very brief meditation
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:25.100]   of about 13 minutes,
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:26.920]   and this would be the sort of quote unquote
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.540]   classic type of meditation of eyes closed,
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.100]   focusing on one's breathing,
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.660]   even a very brief meditation of just 13 minutes or so
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:38.240]   done consistently, so ideally every day,
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.740]   but you have to imagine that even if you skip a day,
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.260]   there are still benefits.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:44.740]   That sort of meditation can greatly enhance
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:45.940]   one's ability to focus.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:48.140]   In her studies, it was also shown
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:50.980]   that sort of brief meditation could also greatly enhance
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:55.700]   mood and sleep and various aspects of cognitive performance
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:57.860]   and work from my laboratory in collaboration
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:00.940]   with Dr. David Spiegel at Stanford Department of Psychiatry
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:03.360]   has shown that even briefer meditations
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.280]   of even just five minutes per day
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.660]   can have fairly outsized positive effects
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.740]   on a number of different parameters as well.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:12.380]   Those very brief types of meditations,
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.900]   because they really are focusing and more accurately,
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:18.180]   I should say, refocusing exercises.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:21.060]   When you do that sort of activity of closing your eyes
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:23.660]   and forcing yourself to focus and refocus
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:25.580]   on your breath and internal state,
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:27.340]   that is directing your perception inward,
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:30.660]   or if you choose, you could deliberately focus
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:33.820]   your perception on some external object or sound
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:34.660]   for that matter.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:37.460]   When one does that,
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:39.780]   the circuits of the brain involved in focus
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:42.620]   dramatically improve, that is they rewire
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:46.440]   and increase their ability for you to achieve focus.
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.180]   Many of us have heard about meditation,
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:53.100]   many of us think about meditation as a mindfulness exercise,
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:54.060]   mindfulness in quotes,
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.820]   'cause that itself needs definition,
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:59.500]   but I prefer to view meditations of the sort
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:03.700]   that I just described as perceptual or focus-based training,
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.460]   which is really what the data point to.
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.420]   Notions around consciousness and states of mind
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:09.980]   are very hard to define,
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:13.100]   but it's very clear that even a five minutes a day,
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.700]   or ideally an up to a 13 minute a day meditation
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.580]   can greatly increase our ability to focus.
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.060]   And based on the findings in this paper,
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.540]   a wandering mind is an unhappy mind,
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:27.780]   also make it very clear that the ability to refocus again
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.180]   and again and again on what we're doing throughout our day,
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:34.900]   regardless of what we're doing can have a very dramatic,
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:38.260]   in fact, a statistically significant increase
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.220]   on our levels of overall happiness.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.340]   So what else does the research tell us we can do
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:45.440]   to increase our levels of genuine happiness?
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:48.620]   Well, it's very clear based on the longitudinal study
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:52.500]   from Harvard, as well as the Yale Happiness Project
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:56.660]   and the work of numerous laboratories in the US and elsewhere
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:01.300]   that quality social connection is extremely powerful
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:05.420]   in terms of its ability to increase our levels of happiness.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:07.860]   What is quality social connection?
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.220]   Quality social connection falls
[01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:11.760]   into a number of different bins.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:14.800]   This can be romantic connection, this can be friendship,
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.500]   this can even be coworker
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:20.520]   or just daily superficial interaction type connections.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.300]   That's surprising to a lot of people
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.780]   because I think a lot of people hear
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:27.220]   quality social connection and they think deep conversation,
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:29.600]   but it's very clear from the research
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.980]   that oftentimes our conversations with people
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:36.420]   that we are closest to are actually quite shallow.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.220]   If you think about it, if you've been in a romantic
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:40.540]   relationship or a friendship for a long period of time,
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:42.180]   or maybe even a sibling relationship
[01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:44.060]   or other family relationship,
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:48.260]   much of what you talk about is fairly superficial
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:49.660]   or fairly trivial.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.340]   In fact, it's often a sharing
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:54.540]   of the trivial day-to-day things between two people
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:58.260]   or through groups of people that leads to the feeling
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.380]   that people are really connected to one another,
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:03.020]   in particular, if it's involving shared experiences
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:05.440]   of any kind, good or bad.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.260]   So there's an extensive literature on social connection
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.000]   and how to build social connection.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.340]   This certainly should be the topic of a full episode
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.020]   of this podcast in the not too distant future,
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.020]   but because social connection can have
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:19.540]   such a powerful impact on our states of happiness
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.760]   and overall wellbeing,
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.100]   I want to emphasize a few features of social connection
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.440]   that I think most people might not appreciate.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:30.180]   Once again, when we hear quality social connection,
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.980]   I think most of us tend to think about
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:35.280]   deep, meaningful conversation or long walks on the beach
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.380]   or camping trips together or travel together.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.560]   And while all of those certainly qualify
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.340]   as wonderful opportunities for social connection,
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.500]   opportunities for quality social connection
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:48.400]   are certainly not limited to those kinds of interactions.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.080]   In fact, I can recall times in my graduate career,
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.940]   so this would be times when I was living in the laboratory,
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:57.940]   'cause that was a significant portion of my graduate years.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:01.160]   And one of the more important social connections for me
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.400]   was the staff that worked there
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.920]   in the wee hours of the night
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.880]   and that came in very early in the morning.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.620]   So one of the more regular social connections I had
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.400]   is I would brush my teeth in the hallway bathroom
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.880]   and there was no one else really around at that time,
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.760]   except for the janitors that tended to leave
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:19.600]   early in the morning,
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.380]   they'd worked a good portion of the night
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.760]   or that were arriving very early in the day.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.840]   And the fact that I would see them on a regular basis
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.620]   and maybe exchange a few words about their work
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:29.280]   or their families or the holidays,
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.960]   actually for me, it became very meaningful in part
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.760]   because my social connections at the time
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.120]   were really limited to only social connections
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.520]   that I had in the context of work.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:41.240]   Now, some people might look at my schedule at that time
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.060]   and look at my life at that time and say,
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.040]   well, that was very unhealthy,
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.460]   you were lacking in certain number of ways.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.880]   But frankly, looking back and at the time,
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.160]   and I know this because I journaled at the time,
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.240]   I was exceedingly happy, at least for that stage of my life.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.120]   At that stage of my life,
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.520]   I wanted to be focused primarily on doing experiments
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.080]   and immersing myself in my scientific training.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:07.920]   And for me, the even seemingly insignificant interactions
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.960]   of talking to the janitor in the morning
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.800]   or some of the other regular staff was not insignificant.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.640]   In fact, for me, it was very significant.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:18.000]   And over the holidays, when their hours were reduced,
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.520]   I actually missed them quite a lot.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.780]   And even as I talk about this,
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.640]   I can recall the feelings of wellbeing
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.520]   of just seeing familiar faces.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:25.960]   And that brings up an important point,
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.200]   which is there's a quite extensive literature
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.760]   pointing to the fact that when we see faces,
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:36.760]   especially faces in the morning and in the late afternoon,
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:40.560]   there is a positive impact on the emotional circuitry,
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.120]   or I should say the circuitry of the brain
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.520]   that underlies emotional wellbeing.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.360]   And that shouldn't come as surprising.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:50.240]   We as old world primates, much like other primates,
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.860]   are very dependent on faces and facial expressions
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:57.160]   in terms of registering our own place in life
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.240]   and our emotional state.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:00.840]   Now, the origins of this are many.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:03.400]   In particular, we have a brain area.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.560]   It's actually called the fusiform face gyrus.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.840]   This is an area of the brain that was largely discovered
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.680]   by women by Nancy Kanwisher at MIT.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:14.320]   And the Kanwisher lab has done extensive work
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.440]   showing that this brain area
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.240]   that's dedicated to the processing of faces
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:22.200]   and not just faces in real life,
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:25.520]   but faces on computer screens and elsewhere
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.200]   are intimately tied to areas of the brain
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.720]   that are associated with emotionality.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.680]   That's actually work from another laboratory,
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:34.180]   Doris Sal's laboratory at Caltech now at UC Berkeley,
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.040]   has shown that this face processing area in the brain
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.320]   in both non-human primates and primates
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:44.620]   is directly linked to the areas of our brain
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:47.140]   that associate with anxiety and fear,
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:48.440]   but also areas of the brain
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.000]   that are associated with wellbeing.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.540]   So it comes as no surprise that when we see faces,
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:54.040]   in particular friendly faces,
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.720]   even if we have just brief interactions with those faces,
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.080]   and even if no words are exchanged,
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.480]   that creates the sense of social bond
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.760]   and it creates a sense of predictability.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.840]   And I raise this again because I think a lot of people
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.840]   think that social connection always has to come in the form
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.580]   of close friendships, which of course are wonderful,
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:12.960]   or close romantic relationships,
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:13.980]   which of course are wonderful,
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:16.740]   or close family relationships, which of course are wonderful.
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:20.440]   But as we'll soon discuss in our model of happiness
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.700]   or how to achieve happiness
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.000]   based on the scientific literature,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.360]   in a few minutes, social connection can and should come
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.720]   in various forms.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.920]   And when I say various forms,
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:33.940]   I mean forms of brief interaction,
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.480]   more superficial interaction,
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.080]   and forms of deeper interaction.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.500]   All of those are relevant to our states of happiness.
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.820]   And there's research to support that daily interactions
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:47.960]   with somebody at a cafe or just a brief hello or a smile,
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.140]   provided that we are both present,
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:51.840]   where we make the effort to be present
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.280]   to those interactions, however brief they are,
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.160]   can have a positive effect on people's overall wellbeing,
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.480]   and not just in that moment, but consistently.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.040]   Evidenced by the fact, I think,
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.260]   that when I look back on those years of working long hours
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:08.280]   in the laboratory and essentially restricting myself
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.640]   either to exercising, sleeping, eating, or working,
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.120]   again, that's what I wanted at that stage of my life,
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.500]   certainly not the way I live my life now,
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.060]   but that's what I wanted at that stage of my life,
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:22.720]   that even those seemingly insignificant social interactions
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:25.900]   were important to me and had a potent impact
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:28.660]   on increasing my level of happiness, and frankly, still do.
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:30.540]   And I feel that right now.
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.960]   That said, I think all of us can appreciate
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.060]   the immense value of social connection
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:37.860]   that is of the more long lasting and,
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:39.820]   for lack of a better word, richer type,
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:43.280]   whether or not that is with siblings or with parents
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.980]   or with friends or with romantic partners.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:48.300]   For that reason, I wanted to emphasize a little bit
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.740]   about what constitutes connection
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:52.360]   and what constitutes social connection.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.520]   There are basically two forms of social connection
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:57.180]   that have been studied, and I'll review both,
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:59.620]   as it relates to increasing our levels of happiness.
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:02.460]   And the first one is presence and eye contact,
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:04.620]   and the second is physical contact.
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:06.780]   So in terms of presence and eye contact,
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.340]   there's been a lot of studies about whether or not
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:12.780]   people exchange direct eye contact during conversation
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:16.860]   or not, dictating whether or not each individual
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:21.060]   in that interaction feels as if they had a connection.
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:24.220]   Now, again, keep in mind that while we think of connection
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:26.820]   as relating to some deep or meaningful conversation,
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.940]   and oftentimes that can be the case, think, for instance,
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:32.960]   an excellent therapist-patient relationship
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.140]   or an excellent romantic relationship
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:38.580]   or an excellent friendship where you really feel heard
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:41.240]   and understood, or at least to the extent that people
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:43.120]   are willing to explore certain topics with you.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.500]   You're willing to hear them and listen really carefully
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.300]   for what they're saying, and they're willing to hear
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:50.660]   and listen to what you're saying in an attempt to understand.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:53.020]   That certainly can enhance the sense of social connection
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:55.580]   leading to what people would call social bonds
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:57.560]   leading to increased happiness.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:00.860]   But eye contact is also known to be an important feature.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:04.820]   The thing about eye contact is that most people assume
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:08.380]   that a lot of eye contact, and in fact, ongoing eye contact,
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:11.660]   is critical to a sense of connection.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.220]   And in fact, that's not the case.
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:16.760]   There's a recent paper that I find really interesting
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.660]   that was published in "Proceedings of the National Academy
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:22.300]   "of Sciences" in 2021, and the title of this paper
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:24.560]   is "Eye Contact Marks the Rise and Fall
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.880]   "of Shared Attention in Conversation."
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.780]   I find this paper interesting for a number of reasons.
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:31.740]   First of all, my laboratory works on internal states
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:33.940]   and vision, so it relates directly to the work
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.300]   that my laboratory does, but also that it violates
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:40.220]   what I thought was a general rule of social connection,
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:42.580]   which is this idea that two people need to be focused
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:45.340]   on one another, that is, looking at one another
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:48.740]   directly and fairly consistently throughout a conversation
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:51.220]   in order for the feeling of connection to emerge.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.460]   But it turns out that's not the case.
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:55.220]   And in fact, just to give you the takeaway,
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:58.580]   and then I'll flesh it out a little bit with some data,
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:02.900]   eye contact, or I should say mutual eye contact,
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:04.540]   so two people registering the presence
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:05.920]   of the other person looking at them.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.620]   You're looking at me, and I'm looking at you.
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:08.980]   If you're watching this on YouTube,
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:12.380]   then perhaps we are actually doing this at that moment.
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:13.980]   And if you're listening, just know that I'm looking
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:16.540]   directly into the camera as I'm saying this at this moment.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:19.940]   If we were to be looking directly at one another,
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:23.500]   that, it turns out, signals the next step,
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:25.440]   which is that it's very likely
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.420]   that we will each both look away.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:31.420]   And that turns out to be a way in which we set
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:35.140]   and reset attention continually during conversation.
[01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:36.460]   So again, I really like this study
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:40.500]   because of the high fidelity, the high temporal precision,
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.940]   that is the precision over time at which they looked
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:47.940]   at eye contact and engagement of attention
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:49.420]   between individuals.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:52.280]   And they did this by looking at things like pupil size,
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.580]   and of course where the eyes were looking,
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:54.880]   and so on and so forth.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.660]   The basic takeaway of this study was the following,
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:58.380]   and here I'm quoting from the study,
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:01.520]   "Rather than maximizing shared attention,
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.740]   good conversation may require shifts
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:07.660]   in and out of shared states accompanied by eye contact."
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:10.220]   So what this basically says is that
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:13.020]   when two people are involved in a very,
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:14.740]   let's call it an intimate conversation,
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:17.660]   but the word intimate should not be misconstrued
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:19.300]   to mean something about intimacy
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.660]   or sexual intimacy or physical intimacy,
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:25.260]   just a conversation in which both people feel present
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:28.220]   to the conversation and focused on that conversation
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:31.040]   and that conversation and its contents only.
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.000]   The tendency is for people to take turns talking,
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.780]   although sometimes depending on the individuals,
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:37.600]   they might interrupt more or less.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.400]   Again, interrupting can be a sign of interest.
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.680]   It doesn't always have to be rude by the way,
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.280]   but they're sharing information,
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:48.600]   hopefully about a common topic or set of topics.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.440]   They will at some moment look at one another,
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.560]   that's what the study shows,
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:56.360]   and that after briefly gazing directly at one another,
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:59.880]   attention peaks and then they will look away
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:01.800]   and attention will get reduced.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.780]   And then the conversation consists of a series
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:08.500]   of focusing back on one another with their eyes
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.900]   and then focusing off, focusing on and focusing off.
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:13.900]   And those mutual eye contact moments
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.660]   actually predict the breaking of attention.
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.360]   So it's this ramping up of attention
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.340]   and breaking of attention,
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:21.620]   ramping of attention and breaking of attention.
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:22.920]   I think these are important results
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.900]   because they violate the stereotype or assumption
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.260]   that deep social connection of the sort leading to happiness
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:35.240]   always involves ongoing eye contact or ongoing focus.
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:39.800]   Just as with meditation, just as with any activity, frankly,
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.760]   we undergo shifts in attention and focus,
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:46.240]   that is focus ramps up and then it breaks
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.200]   and then it re-engages.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.800]   It ramps up, it breaks, and then it re-engages.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.280]   And that it turns out is the basis
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:55.080]   of in-depth connected conversation.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:56.560]   So for those of you that are interested
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:01.220]   in creating social connection in any context,
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.980]   and in particular, for the sake of increasing happiness,
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.780]   because it's very clear that social connections,
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:09.340]   even if they are fairly superficial social connections,
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:11.420]   can increase our sense of happiness.
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:14.780]   Seeing faces is important, ideally faces in person,
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:16.780]   although I suppose these days over Zoom
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:21.620]   or over other screen type medium would be a close second.
[01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:25.440]   But the point is that if you want to increase happiness,
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.600]   you need to have quality social connections.
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:29.280]   And if you want to have quality social connections,
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:30.500]   you need to be present
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.200]   and engage in those social connections.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:37.200]   And that requires a viewing of each other's faces, ideally,
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.820]   which is not to say that a phone call or text exchange
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:41.180]   can't be meaningful,
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.240]   but that faces are really the most powerful way
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.980]   to engage in social contact.
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.500]   And that eye contact, not consistent eye contact,
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:52.020]   but eye contact of the sort that builds up and then breaks
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:54.160]   and builds up and breaks across the interaction
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:58.100]   is going to be the best way that we are aware of
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.440]   to feel that one had a real connection.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.540]   This should also remove any pressure that you might feel
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.500]   to constantly look at somebody
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.360]   or to be completely eyes open,
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.900]   staring at them without blinking or diverting your attention
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.940]   at any point during a conversation.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:16.400]   This also frankly is an opportunity where if somebody says,
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.820]   "Hey, you're not paying attention because you look away,"
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:21.300]   that you may actually be engaging
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:23.860]   in what is the more typical form of healthy connection.
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:26.880]   I talked about this long ago on an episode about focus.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:29.680]   It turns out when we are listening very intently to somebody
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.800]   and trying to remember the information they're telling us,
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:33.420]   we will often close our eyes.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:35.120]   And that's not a form of lack of attention.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.100]   That's actually a form of attending in
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.700]   because we have so much of our brain devoted to vision.
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:42.820]   40% of our brain is devoted to vision
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:43.860]   in some way or another.
[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:44.740]   When we close our eyes,
[01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:47.220]   we can actually devote more attentional resources
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:50.280]   to remembering the specifics of what people are telling us.
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.580]   But again, please don't go through conversations
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:54.240]   with your eyes closed the entire time.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:56.840]   I think that would certainly not be conducive
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.220]   to building social connection.
[01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:01.680]   So we know that faces are important for social connection
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.300]   as it relates to synthetic happiness.
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:06.740]   And we know that eye contact is really important
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:08.280]   for building social connection.
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:13.460]   Physical contact is also important for social connection
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.940]   and not just romantic or sexual type connection.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.620]   In fact, there's a form of physical connection
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:22.860]   that is present in other primates.
[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:26.060]   In fact, it's present as far as we know in all mammals
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:31.060]   and is also very much a feature of the human nervous system.
[01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:33.340]   And that's something called allogrooming.
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:34.300]   I have to imagine that most people
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:36.140]   probably haven't heard of allogrooming.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.620]   The reason I'm bringing up allogrooming
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:41.060]   is that it stems from a fairly extensive literature
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:44.220]   about the prosocial,
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:47.740]   pro happiness effects of pets on humans.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:49.480]   In fact, if you want to read up on this,
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:52.760]   there is a paper out of Yale University on this topic
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:53.920]   that was published in 2018.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.740]   The title of the paper is
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:58.120]   "The Influence of Interactions with Dogs on Affect,"
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:00.860]   AKA emotion, "Anxiety and Arousal in Children."
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.640]   And it references some other studies
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.780]   that were performed on humans.
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:07.220]   And the basic takeaway is that the so-called AAAs,
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:09.200]   animal assisted activities,
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:14.200]   represent a really potent way to increase people,
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:16.320]   including children's feelings of wellbeing.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.620]   Now, what's interesting about this to me
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:22.920]   is that dogs themselves don't really have to do much
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:25.520]   except be present in the room
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.680]   in order for these positive effects,
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:29.800]   that is the reductions in anxiety,
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:32.140]   increases in happiness, et cetera, to occur.
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:34.660]   And in fact, they can be very, very brief.
[01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:35.500]   As they describe in the paper,
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:38.120]   "Brief unstructured interactions with an unfamiliar dog,"
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.000]   so you don't even need to know this dog,
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.980]   "after exposure to a moderate stressor
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:45.340]   showed higher positive affect relevant participants
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:46.660]   who received a soothing object
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.360]   or waited for the same amount of time."
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.340]   So just even seeing a dog for a brief amount of time
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:56.240]   has been shown to reduce stress and improve happiness,
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:00.420]   or I should say, increase feelings of happiness overall.
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:03.400]   Then a child receiving a soothing object,
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.640]   which was at least for me a little bit counterintuitive,
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:06.980]   I would have thought that children receiving
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:10.780]   a soothing object would have been the more powerful stimulus.
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:13.480]   But in fact, it wasn't, at least not in this study.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:15.440]   The real question I think we should be asking ourselves
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:18.460]   is what is it about interactions with others
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:21.780]   and with other animals that could potentially have
[01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:25.020]   this prosocial happiness-enhancing effect?
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:27.440]   And the reason I raise this is also because
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:31.620]   I think many people are interested in either owning
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:33.340]   or having interactions with pets
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:35.140]   as a way to improve their feelings of wellbeing.
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:39.200]   And I say having interactions with, because I myself,
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.220]   I'm a good example of somebody
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:43.180]   who wasn't always able to have pets.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:45.060]   So when I was a graduate student in a postdoc,
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.660]   I very much wanted a dog,
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:48.100]   very, very, very much wanted a dog.
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:50.140]   In fact, there was a rule in my family at some point
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:52.800]   that I wasn't allowed to talk about dogs anymore
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:54.840]   because I was talking about all the breeds of dogs,
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:58.200]   going to dog breeders, examining different breeds,
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:00.280]   going to the pound, et cetera.
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.380]   The point was that I was obsessed with getting a dog,
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:05.760]   but I knew I wasn't in a good position to own a dog yet.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:06.840]   I didn't have the finances.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:10.280]   I didn't have the correct living situation and so on.
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:12.460]   Eventually I did own a dog, of course,
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:13.320]   but at the time I couldn't.
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:15.160]   So what I would do is every Sunday,
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.960]   I would go to a place where they foster dogs
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:19.060]   and they needed dog walkers and I would walk their dog.
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:22.280]   I would also walk my neighbor's dogs.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:23.400]   I didn't charge them for it.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.340]   In fact, I felt like I was being paid
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:27.060]   by getting time with those dogs.
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:29.480]   And in fact, I put an ad at that time on Craigslist
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:31.520]   that I would walk people's dogs for free,
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:33.460]   and only a few people took that seriously.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:34.640]   But of the ones that did,
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:37.560]   I had a great little cadre of dog owners
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.880]   that would allow me to take their dogs out
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:40.000]   and I was super happy.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.760]   It just made me very, very happy.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.760]   And I really enjoyed it.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:47.160]   And frankly, it was a great opportunity for me
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.360]   to also get to know the various dog breeds
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.520]   and the different dog temperaments
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.440]   and to learn a bit about my ability
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.720]   to interact with dogs in a certain way.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:56.500]   I actually got to be a pretty good dog walker.
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:57.880]   Unfortunately, later I got a bulldog
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:00.120]   and it turns out no matter how good a dog walker you are,
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.780]   bulldogs just simply don't like to walk.
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:04.120]   In fact, if you've ever walked up to a bulldog
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:06.520]   and you've offered to scratch or pet that dog,
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.440]   you'll notice that bulldogs love that.
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:11.740]   And I would argue, having been a bulldog owner,
[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:13.380]   that they like it because it's an opportunity
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:15.200]   for them to stop moving.
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.400]   But that's more about the bulldog
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.740]   than what I'm about to tell you next,
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:21.160]   which is this principle of so-called allogrooming.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:23.080]   Allogrooming is a pattern of behavior
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:25.380]   that's observed in essentially all mammals,
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:30.040]   but very strongly in non-human primates and primates,
[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:35.040]   where individuals within a species touch one another,
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:38.000]   and this is non-sexual touch.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.240]   So this would be someone brushing somebody else's hair
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.600]   or combing their hair,
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:46.540]   or even using a lint roller on them, for instance,
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:49.600]   or someone grooming somebody else.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:51.560]   Now, typically one needs to have
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:53.520]   an established relationship with this person.
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:55.400]   So it could be a professional-type relationship
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:57.600]   where this is a barber cutting somebody's hair
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:01.780]   or a hairdresser cutting or styling somebody's hair.
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:04.480]   It could be somebody giving someone a manicure or a pedicure.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:06.480]   It could be somebody doing skincare or massage
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.520]   for somebody in a professional context,
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:10.800]   or it could be two people who have agreed
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.240]   that it is appropriate for the context
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.780]   and for the relationship for one person
[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:16.920]   to be grooming somebody else.
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:19.380]   This can even, believe it or not, there's literature on this,
[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:22.900]   this can even extend into the realm of people
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:25.160]   sort of cleaning and picking off other people.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:27.540]   Now, when we see this in primates,
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:29.040]   it seems like a very cute
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.240]   and sort of almost understandable behavior.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.880]   We can see these pictures online.
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:36.080]   If you look them up, you can just look up allogrooming
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:38.820]   and you'll see a vast number of pictures of, for instance,
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:42.580]   baboons picking little things out of each other's hair,
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:46.520]   or grooming and kind of perusing one another
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:49.720]   to find things, presumably parasites
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:51.480]   or like little bits of plants or something like that
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:52.760]   that they want to remove from them.
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:56.880]   Allogrooming is known to stimulate a certain category
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:59.520]   of neurons called the C-tactile fibers.
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:02.580]   These are a particular category of so-called sensory neurons
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:03.760]   that innervate our skin.
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.820]   So these are literally like little endings of neurons,
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:09.160]   little wires that end up in the skin
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:11.540]   that when they are touched lightly,
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:14.240]   tend to create a feeling of wellbeing
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:15.720]   in the person that's being touched.
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:17.480]   Again, this is consensual touch
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:19.400]   that's very context appropriate,
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.320]   but it's known to increase levels of oxytocin,
[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:27.520]   a kind of hormone slash neurotransmitter, it's both really,
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:31.080]   that is known to evoke feelings of bond
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.200]   or of feeling bonded to somebody or something.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:36.560]   And for many people, we hear about oxytocin
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:40.080]   and we think about the bond between parent and child,
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:41.460]   in particular, mother and infant,
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:43.000]   where it's been most extensively studied
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.660]   or between two members of a romantic couple.
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:47.680]   But if you look at the literature on allogrooming,
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.960]   what you find is that when humans groom one another,
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:54.520]   the increases in oxytocin that are experienced
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.820]   are at least on par with, and in fact,
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:01.900]   more often more dramatic in response to allogrooming
[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:04.720]   than in response to other forms of touch.
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:07.620]   So the point here is that allogrooming
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:11.680]   is a pro-social behavior that tends to associate with
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:15.200]   and promote feelings of wellbeing and happiness.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:17.080]   And this is not a trivial effect.
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.220]   If you look at the brain imaging data
[02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:20.680]   or other forms of data on this,
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:23.120]   allogrooming is a very powerful form
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:26.560]   of bonding between individuals that's completely nonverbal.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.840]   In fact, most often it doesn't involve eye contact.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.940]   I suppose two people could be looking at one another,
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.300]   grooming one another, but typically this is done
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:34.920]   from the side or from behind.
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:38.880]   Why did I bring up the paper on pets?
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.280]   Well, it turns out that when humans stroke dogs
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:45.560]   or brush their dogs or stroke cats
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.040]   or brush their cats, et cetera,
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:50.800]   that is a form of human to animal allogrooming.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.460]   And it's one in which both the pet and the human
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.720]   receive huge increases in oxytocin
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:01.920]   and other related neurochemicals that make us feel bonded.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:04.720]   I bring this up because the Harvard Longitudinal Study
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:06.880]   on Happiness and many, many others,
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:09.080]   if not hundreds of other studies on happiness,
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.280]   point to the importance of quality social connection, right?
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:13.620]   You hear this over and over again.
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:14.640]   People on their death beds
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:16.400]   don't say they wish they had worked more.
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.760]   People on their death beds
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.040]   talk about the richness of social connections
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:22.000]   or the wish that they had invested more
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.320]   in social connections.
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:25.600]   I think a lot of people think of social connections
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:30.600]   only in terms of travel with or conversation with others,
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:35.080]   but much of what we perceive as deep social connections
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:38.040]   also involves physical contact.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:40.480]   And that's something that's deeply rooted
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.920]   in our evolutionary biology.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:44.660]   And it's present both in us and in non-human primates.
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:48.160]   And it's clear that we can engage
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.320]   in these kinds of pro-social, non-verbal,
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:53.260]   non-eye contact type behaviors
[02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:56.660]   through things like non-sexual tactile touch,
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:58.180]   AKA allogrooming.
[02:02:58.180 --> 02:02:59.020]   So we've been talking about
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:00.820]   a number of the different things that one can do
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.660]   in order to increase levels of happiness.
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:05.960]   And certainly before we conclude today,
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:09.360]   I'm going to touch back into not just synthetic happiness
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.560]   and the various things we can do,
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:13.740]   such as pro-social spending, allogrooming,
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:16.280]   social connection, et cetera,
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:19.020]   but also things related to happiness
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:24.020]   that involve focus on vocation and work and pursuit of goals.
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:26.500]   Because as I mentioned at the beginning,
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.520]   those are also critical
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.420]   to increasing our state of happiness
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.160]   and certainly our state of security
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:34.280]   and the feeling that we can provide for ourselves
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:35.920]   and perhaps for others as well.
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:38.040]   We will talk about that,
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:41.440]   but I think it's also important to talk about this notion
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.400]   of choice and choices
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:46.880]   and whether or not having a lot of freedom to choose
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:50.960]   or limited freedom in choosing what we do and what we get
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.160]   and what we are able to pursue in life,
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:56.400]   how that relates to both natural happiness
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:58.200]   and synthetic happiness.
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:01.320]   Dan Gilbert and others have explored this issue
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:05.000]   of freedom of choice and how it relates to happiness.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.480]   And there, I must say the findings
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:10.800]   are incredibly counterintuitive,
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:14.240]   but very, very well supported by all of their data.
[02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:17.800]   I'm going to summarize a large amount of those studies
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.740]   at once by saying the following.
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.620]   Dan's laboratory and other laboratories
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:23.460]   have done experiments
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:26.020]   where they give people a series of options.
[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:27.960]   In one of the more classic examples,
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.600]   they give people the opportunity
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.600]   to rate a number of different paintings or pictures
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:36.880]   in ascending or descending order of preference.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.800]   In other words, they're deciding which ones they like most,
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:40.820]   which ones they like least.
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:43.520]   Then what's interesting is the experimenter
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:45.140]   will vary the extent to which
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:46.920]   they have to stick to that choice.
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:48.760]   So this could be sticking to the choice
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.200]   by receiving that painting to take home.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:52.540]   Or in another experiment,
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:54.380]   it was having to make a choice
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:57.260]   between giving up one photograph that they,
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:58.920]   the research subject took,
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:00.420]   or another photograph that they took.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:03.180]   One of the photographs was going to go off to a publication,
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:05.420]   another one they could keep for themselves.
[02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:07.580]   And the conditions in that experiment
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:10.760]   were either that you had to make the decision
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:13.480]   and it was final, that is you could keep one,
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:16.420]   and rate your decision, or you could keep one,
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:19.600]   and then you had the opportunity to swap out that picture
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:21.200]   for the other one at some later time.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.040]   In other words, these experiments
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.820]   really weren't about rating pictures.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:27.080]   They were really about whether or not
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:28.880]   constraining your choice,
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:31.440]   meaning forcing somebody to make a choice
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.640]   and stick to that choice,
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:35.420]   led to greater levels or lesser levels
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:38.080]   of happiness and satisfaction with that choice.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:41.940]   And what they find consistently is that
[02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:45.980]   when people have an ongoing set of choices,
[02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:48.500]   it leads to reduced levels of happiness.
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.460]   Now that might come as surprising to many of you,
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:52.460]   but I want to be clear about what this means.
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:55.420]   This is not to say that having a lot of choices
[02:05:55.420 --> 02:05:59.920]   of what you like most leads to lesser happiness,
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:03.500]   and that having fewer choices about things you do
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:06.360]   or objects you acquire, et cetera,
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:09.060]   leads to greater happiness.
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:11.780]   What this set of experiments really points to
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:14.400]   is that when we make a choice,
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:17.300]   if we are forced to stick to that choice,
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.780]   we tend to be far happier with that choice
[02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:23.600]   than if we maintain the option to change our mind.
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:24.820]   The results of these experiments
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:27.360]   are extremely informative, I believe,
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:30.560]   in terms of understanding our real life happiness,
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:33.320]   that is happiness outside the laboratory.
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.640]   But I think they are often misunderstood
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:37.540]   as meaning that if we have a lot of choices,
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:40.240]   we tend to be less happy than if we have fewer choices.
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:41.400]   That is not the case.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:44.260]   Having freedom of choice is terrific
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:48.100]   and actually correlates with elevated levels of happiness.
[02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:50.580]   But once we make our choice,
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:53.860]   it's clearly the case that killing all other choices
[02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:56.660]   or having all other options killed for us
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:07:00.020]   increases our satisfaction with the choice that we've made.
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:03.540]   Whereas leaving doors open, leaving options open,
[02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:06.940]   greatly diminishes our sense of satisfaction.
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:08.780]   And this has been exported
[02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:10.420]   to any number of different domains.
[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:12.900]   So this has been exported to the domain
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:16.340]   of making choices about what college to go to
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:18.660]   or what partner to select in life.
[02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:21.640]   In every one of those instances,
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:23.700]   we see that our happiness with our choice
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:25.640]   is very much related to that choice
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:30.540]   being either the only one or one of very few other options.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:32.940]   There are a number of different ways to interpret this.
[02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:34.680]   Through the lens of neuroscience,
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:38.480]   we might say that the prefrontal cortex,
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:41.760]   the area of the brain that's involved in decision-making
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:44.800]   and evaluating different options
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.340]   is an area of the brain that's vital, frankly,
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:50.220]   to our evolution as human beings
[02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:53.220]   and to our daily life and to our whole life.
[02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:54.600]   It is, of course, the thing that allows us
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:57.760]   to evaluate different rule sets, to change rule sets,
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:00.740]   to switch contexts and to create meaning, et cetera,
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:02.840]   to interpret what's good, what's bad.
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.840]   But it's also a fairly costly process,
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:06.860]   meaning it's very metabolically demanding.
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.920]   And there's an entire literature
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.780]   related to what's called ego depletion.
[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:12.960]   This is certainly a topic for a future podcast,
[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:14.740]   but ego depletion essentially says
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:19.740]   that if I have you attend very intensely to a given task,
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:22.260]   for instance, asking you to count backwards
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:25.580]   from 1,000 to zero in increments of 13,
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:28.420]   and then have you switch about halfway through,
[02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:30.560]   that's hard for a lot of people.
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.580]   If I have you do that,
[02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:35.620]   then your ability to suppress impulsive behavior
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:38.820]   and to do a hard cognitive or physical task
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.900]   immediately after that is actually suppressed,
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:42.040]   this so-called ego depletion.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.380]   It relates to a number of different things,
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:46.740]   but it certainly relates to engagement
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:47.940]   of the prefrontal cortex,
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:49.940]   which is very metabolically demanding.
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:53.880]   So evaluating choices and doing computation of numbers
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:56.100]   or attending to things with your mind
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:58.300]   and forcing yourself to focus intensely
[02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:00.300]   is metabolically demanding.
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.980]   And that's a limited resource that can be reset
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:04.960]   by things like sleep and non-sleep deep rest
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.860]   or idle time or letting your mind wander.
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:08.660]   In that case, a positive mind wandering
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:11.960]   to allow your brain to reset its ability to focus.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:14.940]   But the other thing that it does
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:18.480]   is it impacts the reward circuitry of the brain,
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.180]   the so-called dopamine reward circuitry
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:22.580]   and other reward circuitries of the brain.
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:24.940]   And here I'm painting with a broad brush,
[02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:29.020]   but it essentially divides them such that, for instance,
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:32.260]   if a given choice of a, let's say a partner,
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:34.860]   or maybe you're buying ourselves an article of clothing,
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:37.740]   not that I want to compare selection of a life partner
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:39.120]   to selection of an article of clothing,
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:40.940]   but just to give multiple examples,
[02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:43.680]   might give us, and here it's arbitrary units,
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:48.000]   X units of dopamine increase.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.120]   Well, if we buy that article of clothing
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:51.780]   or we select that life partner,
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:55.180]   and then we emerge from the store or the wedding
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:58.840]   and we are focused on what we purchased for ourselves,
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:03.380]   our choice or our life partner choice, and only that,
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:06.780]   well, then there's a certain amount of neurochemical reward
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:09.620]   associated with that and happiness and wellbeing.
[02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:14.620]   But it's also very clear that if we leave those choices,
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:18.180]   the store or our wedding, for instance,
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:20.900]   or a life with somebody for a moment, even just mentally,
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:23.260]   and start thinking about the other options
[02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:25.660]   that we might entertain as possible,
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:28.920]   if those are still open to us in reality or in our mind,
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:32.640]   well, then our reward circuitry becomes fractured in a way,
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:34.220]   not physically fractured,
[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:37.120]   but less attention is devoted to the reward circuitry
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:40.200]   of associated with our choice.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.520]   And as a consequence,
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.760]   instead of it being X units of dopamine,
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.320]   it's X divided by however many other choices
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:51.240]   we might have available to us in our mind or in reality.
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:53.800]   Okay, so instead of, and again, these are arbitrary units,
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.880]   but instead of a certain amount of reward,
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:57.040]   it's a certain amount of reward
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:59.200]   divided by the number of other options
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:02.300]   that we might be considering as alternatives
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:03.960]   to what we chose.
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:06.920]   And I think this is a very important aspect
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.680]   of understanding how limiting our choices
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:14.320]   after we've made them is a vital part
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.200]   of what we call synthetic happiness.
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:18.720]   In fact, we could even go so far as to say
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:20.680]   that focusing on the choices we've made
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:24.500]   and really investing in those choices as good ones
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:27.360]   or great ones, and really trying to limit our thinking
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:29.960]   to the choices that we've made once we've made them
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:34.420]   is perhaps also important to our natural happiness
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:38.040]   because it's so inextricably entwined
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.100]   with what we think of as a good life.
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:44.580]   And what I mean by that is if we are constantly in a mode
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:46.180]   of evaluative decision-making
[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:48.180]   even after we've made a decision,
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.700]   we are not neurochemically nor psychologically
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.120]   able to extract the feelings of happiness
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:55.940]   associated with the choice that we made.
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:57.640]   So we've talked about a number of different dimensions
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.180]   of happiness, both in synthetic and natural happiness
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:04.520]   and some of the more counterintuitive aspects of happiness.
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:06.960]   For instance, that people tend to adjust their levels
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:09.760]   of happiness, not regardless,
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.700]   but often in spite of their life circumstances.
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:16.600]   But as we emphasized earlier in the episode,
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:18.760]   that is not to say, at least the research
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:20.920]   does not directly support the idea
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:25.200]   that a major trauma or loss won't impact our happiness.
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.280]   In fact, it tends to, and that's why it's important
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:30.360]   that people access resources and work
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:31.780]   devoted to overcoming trauma,
[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:33.440]   which certainly exists out there.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:37.500]   And of course, there are the longitudinal studies
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:40.500]   and short-term studies showing that income level
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:44.760]   and material things don't necessarily scale with happiness
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:46.200]   and vice versa.
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:49.320]   And yet we also acknowledge early in the episode
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:51.720]   that while indeed money can't buy happiness,
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:53.240]   it can buffer stress.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:57.700]   And while work doesn't necessarily bring happiness per se,
[02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:00.700]   work can bring a tremendous feeling of meaning
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:04.400]   and resources, which can then put you into context
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:06.980]   in which things like pro-social contact
[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:09.880]   and enhanced bonds and caretaking of others
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.240]   and they're of you can be enhanced.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:16.440]   So it would be unfair and in fact inaccurate
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.600]   to simply view happiness through the lens
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:21.940]   of money doesn't matter, it's all about social connection
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:23.940]   and so on and so forth.
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:26.620]   Absolutely social connection is important,
[02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:29.040]   which is why we spent some minutes talking about
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:30.700]   some of the ways to enhance social connection,
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.180]   both with other human beings and other animals
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:34.520]   and them with us.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:38.160]   I think there's a opportunity here
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:40.400]   to take the research on happiness,
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:43.880]   the research on the neuroscience of what happiness
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:47.360]   and gratitude and pro-social connection tells us
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:49.920]   and to combine it into a bit of a model
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:51.400]   or a toolkit, if you will.
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:53.500]   And I think indeed this will be a toolkit
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.240]   in one of our future toolkit episodes,
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:57.560]   likely merged with the toolkit on gratitude,
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:59.440]   which we haven't done yet.
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:03.200]   And perhaps even we will do an entire episode
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:06.760]   on social bonds and how to enhance or build social bonds,
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:09.200]   or at least what the science tells us about that.
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:12.400]   If we take a step back and we look at the concept
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:17.000]   of happiness, we can make a couple of absolute statements,
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.840]   that is statements that I think very few people,
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:20.080]   if any, would contest.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:22.120]   First of all, there's no single molecule
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.000]   or chemical associated with happiness,
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.680]   but that the chemical milieu of the brain and body
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:30.560]   is important for setting the stage
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.380]   or the opportunity for happiness.
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:35.880]   Hence why there are treatments aimed
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.200]   at alleviating depression or mania
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.240]   that target certain neurochemical systems
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:42.040]   and hormone systems.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:45.400]   Happiness, at least the way I'm framing it today,
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:46.680]   has essentially two components.
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:51.680]   One is meaning, that is what sort of meaning
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:55.420]   do certain types of interactions or behaviors,
[02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:59.760]   could be work, could be social interactions, et cetera,
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:01.460]   carry for us.
[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:04.000]   And nested in that is this concept of connection.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.340]   And we talked a bit about tools for enhancing connection.
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.880]   Things like eye contact, but not constant eye contact.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.600]   Things like being very present to a conversation
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:15.080]   or an activity that you're engaging in.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.880]   Remember, we talked about the paper,
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:19.280]   a distracted mind is an unhappy mind,
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:20.480]   the paper published in Science.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:22.760]   And we talked about the study also published in Science
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:24.720]   in which giving money,
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.080]   but also knowing how that money
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.140]   has positively impacted others,
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:32.360]   leads to this feeling of pro-social connection
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:35.400]   and happiness in the giver and in the receiver.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:36.920]   And I should mention again,
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:38.500]   that it's not just the giving of money,
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:42.580]   but also the giving of effort and time and attention
[02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:44.160]   that can have similar effects.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:45.800]   So we have meaning and connection
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:48.160]   and a number of different ways to access those.
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:51.200]   And then we have this access that I'm referring to
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:52.840]   as performance and resources.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.160]   And I'm talking about performance and resources
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:59.520]   as it relates to natural happiness,
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.440]   not synthetic happiness, but natural happiness,
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:05.280]   because we would be wrong, I believe,
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:08.280]   if we were to say that income doesn't matter.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:11.280]   I think it's fair to say based on the research
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.680]   that income matters and income that can cover
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:17.820]   costs of living plus that includes some buffer.
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:19.880]   And what do I mean by buffer?
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:21.780]   I mean, buffer to the anxiety
[02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:25.120]   that circumstances might change is important.
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.600]   Now that's going to vary from person to person,
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:31.120]   meaning some people will be perfectly happy
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.120]   making $1 more than their absolute cost of living
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:38.980]   every month.
[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:41.940]   Other people will require a more substantial buffer
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:44.200]   in order to protect them
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.180]   against the negative psychological effects
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.480]   of worrying about, for instance, inflation
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:50.180]   or worrying that they might lose their job.
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:53.360]   And this is why I think most people recommend having,
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:56.160]   if possible, some buffer in their bank account
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:59.900]   that could cover two or three or maybe even six
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:02.680]   or maybe in 12 months of living expenses,
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:03.920]   were they to lose their job
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:06.280]   or something catastrophic happened to them.
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:08.900]   So if we're going to talk about happiness,
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:11.540]   I think it's only fair, only accurate,
[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:13.200]   and frankly only respectful
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:17.000]   to talk about living requirements
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.460]   and cost of living requirements
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:20.300]   that includes this sort of buffer
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:23.340]   and that that buffer to anxiety is going to vary
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:24.980]   depending on how anxious somebody gets
[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:27.380]   about the possibility of catastrophic things
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:28.940]   happening to them, like losing their job
[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:30.520]   or their rent going up or doubling.
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:32.300]   And here I'm talking about hypotheticals,
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:33.920]   but I think we all know people
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:35.840]   and perhaps ourselves have experienced
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.480]   those kinds of circumstances.
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:38.620]   So when we talk about happiness,
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:41.380]   we absolutely need to think about resources
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.180]   and we also need to think about performance.
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:45.780]   I think we would be completely inaccurate
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:50.780]   if we simply said, oh, any work leading to any outcomes,
[02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:53.780]   any effort, regardless of whether or not it gets you
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:56.180]   an A in school or an F in school
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:58.420]   isn't going to impact your happiness.
[02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:00.740]   I don't think anyone would agree with that.
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:02.900]   And yet, if you look at the major takeaways,
[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:04.660]   at least as they are communicated,
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.220]   typically in the public sphere around the longitudinal
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:12.120]   and short-term studies of happiness,
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:17.120]   the takeaway generally is more focused on social connection
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.280]   and how money is not important.
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.400]   I don't think anyone that's saying that actually means
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:25.800]   that income that can cover your expenses
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:29.200]   plus some buffer isn't important, but it's often not stated.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:31.740]   So if we were to come up with a general model of happiness
[02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:33.700]   that includes various tools
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:36.120]   for how to increase our levels of happiness,
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:38.460]   I think it's only fair to include both natural
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:40.420]   and synthetic forms of happiness
[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:44.000]   and to pursue both natural and synthetic happiness.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000]   Just to remind you, natural happiness
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.360]   is the kind of happiness that we associate
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:51.020]   with obtaining something either by effort
[02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:52.320]   or because it was given to us.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:54.320]   Although I definitely want to highlight the fact
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:59.320]   that receiving things that don't require much reward
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.300]   in order to receive them over time
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:03.680]   can be detrimental to our dopamine system.
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:05.000]   That's an important aside.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.240]   The other form of happiness is the form of happiness
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:10.100]   that we call synthetic happiness,
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:13.560]   which is for instance, focusing on social connection.
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:15.240]   And we talked about ways to do that
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:17.720]   as a means to enhance your happiness, right?
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:21.000]   Again, the language, the name synthetic happiness
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.520]   implies something kind of artificial,
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:26.080]   but frankly, genuine social connection is genuine.
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:28.480]   There's nothing artificial about it or synthetic about it.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:30.440]   It's that you can synthesize it through action,
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:32.100]   through deliberate action.
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:36.540]   Likewise, being focused or encouraging yourself,
[02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:38.740]   working on being focused on whatever activities
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:41.200]   you happen to be engaged in, positive or negative,
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.580]   is known to increase your levels of happiness.
[02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:46.200]   Again, this is a form of synthetic happiness.
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:49.520]   You're not obtaining anything new or additional
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.680]   as a consequence of this.
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:52.880]   It's entirely internal, right?
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:54.360]   There's no external reward.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:56.800]   There isn't more money that arrives with this
[02:19:56.800 --> 02:19:57.780]   or a better grade.
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:19:59.480]   Although I would make the argument
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:01.780]   that if you are present to the work you're doing
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:05.200]   in any context, physical or mental work,
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:07.680]   it's very likely that you are going to perform better
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:08.840]   at that work.
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:11.560]   So we have natural happiness and synthetic happiness,
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:15.180]   and both of them require our attention and effort.
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:18.440]   And in fact, if we were to draw a link
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:20.760]   between natural and synthetic happiness,
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:22.840]   it really is this concept of presence,
[02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:25.000]   of really being focused on what we're doing
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.680]   that's most likely to lead to the outcomes that we want,
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:31.800]   both externally in terms of receiving monetary rewards
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:33.820]   or grades or praise or whatever it is
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:35.740]   that you happen to be pursuing out there,
[02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:37.320]   resources of some kind,
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:41.120]   and presence and striving to be present
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:44.240]   when in the pursuit of so-called synthetic happiness
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:46.320]   in the form of social connection
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:49.160]   or in the form of really focusing on the choice
[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:51.520]   that you've made and making the best of that choice,
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:53.340]   especially since you made that choice
[02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:56.660]   in a way that you deemed best at the time,
[02:20:56.660 --> 02:20:59.340]   well, that also is known to increase
[02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:01.260]   your overall levels of happiness.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:04.440]   So if an ability to focus and attend to things deeply
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:06.420]   is really what's most important
[02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:08.620]   and really acts as the greatest lever
[02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:10.860]   for both natural and synthetic happiness,
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:13.880]   well, then tools like a five-minute daily meditation
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:16.340]   or a 13-minute a day meditation,
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:18.440]   as well as tools that allow us
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:21.060]   to get excellent sleep every night,
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:24.440]   which of course sets the basis for attention during the day.
[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:25.780]   If you've ever had a poor night's sleep,
[02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:28.620]   then you are very familiar with how hard it is
[02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:31.060]   to focus the following day,
[02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:33.100]   at least for long periods of time.
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:35.500]   But building our capacity to focus
[02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:36.840]   through a focusing exercise,
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.900]   which again is often called meditation,
[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:41.100]   but is really simply just a focusing
[02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:43.200]   and perceptual exercise,
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:46.980]   that's going to create an outsize effect on all the aspects,
[02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:49.960]   all the behaviors that we know feed into creating natural
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.540]   and synthetic happiness.
[02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:53.060]   And so it's really fair to say
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:55.540]   that our ability to attend and focus
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:57.540]   really equates to happiness.
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:21:59.780]   So as is often typical of this podcast,
[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:02.380]   today we've talked a lot about the various aspects
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.900]   of the science of happiness,
[02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:05.380]   including the different forms of happiness
[02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:08.860]   and tools to access those different forms of happiness.

[02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:24.600]   but often which is distinct from information
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:26.120]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:27.880]   So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram,
