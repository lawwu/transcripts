[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500]   We close the week with a rather technical question
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.760]   this Friday, bear with us.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.360]   It's also an important question,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.640]   an important question from a sharp listener
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.640]   to the podcast named Brent.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.680]   Pastor John, hello, can you tell me
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.440]   why modern English translations translate cathesis
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.440]   in 1 Peter 2.13 as institution or authority or ordinance?
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.120]   Every other occurrence is typically translated
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.400]   as in the ESV as creation 16 times
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.060]   or creature two other times.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.360]   To me, based on the context,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.160]   it seems as though we as believers
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.400]   are to submit ourselves to or to be subject
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   for the Lord's sake to every human creature.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.100]   For such a thing, we have been freed
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.820]   by the finished work of Christ to do good, verse 15,
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.400]   and to serve them as servants of God, verse 16,
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.460]   as we honor everyone, verse 17.
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.120]   Even Paul's text on submitting to authority
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.880]   in Romans 13, verses one to seven,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.360]   broadens quickly to a discussion
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.720]   of how we relate to all people in verse eight.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.640]   So is Peter's cathesis mistranslated
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.960]   or am I missing a nuance here?
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.720]   I think Brent is basically right here
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.880]   in drawing our attention to the way Peter unfolds
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.000]   the act of subjection in 1 Peter 2.13,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.020]   in the acts of doing good in verse 15,
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.420]   the act of serving in verse 16,
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.900]   the act of honoring in verse 17.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.640]   I think that's a really sharp contextual observation
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.400]   to draw those four things together,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.300]   subjection, doing good, serving, honoring.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.420]   So let me step back and see whether there are
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.380]   other considerations that might affect
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.520]   how we understand, how we translate the word
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.040]   cathesis or creation or institution,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.880]   as it's translated in so many modern versions.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.520]   The ESV, like most English versions,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.680]   translates 1 Peter 2.13,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.240]   be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.320]   whether it be to the emperor as supreme
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.920]   or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.980]   and praise those who do good.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.780]   Now that term human institution,
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.200]   Brent is saying, is literally human creation.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.580]   And that's right, it is.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.140]   And that's the most literal translation of it.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.380]   So the translation would then be,
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.760]   be subject for the Lord's sake to every human creation.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   Now, before we can even ponder whether that's right or not,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.820]   we have to ask what it means,
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.700]   'cause it's an ambiguous phrase, isn't it?
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.160]   It might mean things created by humans.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.800]   So a human creation might be a government
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.240]   or laws that humans have created.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.400]   Or the phrase human creation
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.000]   might mean humans created by God.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So human beings are God's human creation.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.400]   So 1 Peter 2.13 might mean,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.660]   be subject to whatever man creates
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.980]   or be subject to the persons that God creates.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.940]   Which is it?
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.260]   And I think the answer,
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.980]   if you just take those two questions,
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.340]   would be pretty clear from the use
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.620]   of the word create and creation,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.820]   the verb and the noun throughout the New Testament.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.500]   39 times, I looked them all up,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.340]   39 times the New Testament uses this word create
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.580]   or creation and without exception, no exceptions,
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.140]   they refer to God's act.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.500]   Never in the New Testament does creation or create
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   refer to something man has made or man does.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.420]   So I think it would be highly unlikely
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.600]   that the term human creation in 1 Peter 2.13
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.620]   would refer to something that humans create.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.620]   Rather, the term very likely means human creation
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.700]   in the sense of humans that God creates.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.760]   Human beings are God's human creation.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.180]   Now that in fact is the way Brent
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.840]   in his question is understanding it.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.740]   And he's wondering, well, why shouldn't it be translated,
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.520]   be subject for the Lord's sake to every human creation
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.820]   or more clearly creature, every human creature
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.020]   that is person created by God.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.180]   Why isn't verse 13 to be understood
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.740]   as calling for a kind of submission
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.780]   to all people, all human beings?
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.420]   Now, whether we're going to be sympathetic
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.540]   to that possible translation,
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.900]   namely be subject for the Lord's sake
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.620]   to every human creature is going to depend on two things.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.540]   First, do we believe that the word be subject,
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.720]   you put target day in Greek,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.500]   be subject can mean anything less than obey,
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.280]   maybe more, but not less than obey.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.800]   If we think that this word be subject
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.020]   always involves the idea of obedience,
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.020]   then we won't be able to say with Peter's intention
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.020]   that we should be subject to every human person
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.800]   because many humans would instruct us to do sinful things
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.780]   that we certainly should not obey.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.080]   And I think it's fair to say
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.600]   that's the judgment of most biblical scholars,
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.240]   namely that being subject does involve
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.440]   the idea of obedience.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.720]   That's the first thing that will affect
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.040]   how we translate this.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.200]   The second factor that leads people away
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   from translating verse 13 as be subject
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.560]   to every human creature is that the immediate application
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.560]   and perhaps limitation that Peter puts on it is this.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.960]   He continues, "Whether it be to the emperor as supreme
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.660]   or to governors as sent by him."
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.720]   So the argument is that since Peter
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   is applying subjection to governors and emperors,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.880]   he doesn't mean it to apply to all human creatures,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.680]   but only to those whom God has created
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   to have his appointed authority,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   as for example is more clear in Romans 13, one to four.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.740]   Now, those two arguments are strong enough
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.740]   to incline me and most others not to take issue
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.720]   with the common translation,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.760]   But like I said at the beginning,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.920]   Brit is onto something that we really should take seriously
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.560]   because even if it might not be
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   Peter's primary intention here,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.940]   it seems to be his and Paul's understanding
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.720]   of the Christian life to say that there is a sense
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.380]   in which we are to be subject to all people,
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.700]   not in the sense of obeying, but in the sense of serving.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   That is be subject in the sense of humbling yourself
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.240]   and going down low, subject, sub,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   and getting under another person
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.120]   and doing all you can to lift them up
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.120]   into truth and righteousness and everlasting joy.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.340]   Now, Peter seems to go in this direction in verse 15,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:07.260]   when he grounds the submission to every human creature
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.640]   or institution by saying,
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.220]   because this is the will of God,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.620]   that by doing good, you put to silence
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.100]   the ignorance of foolish people.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.100]   And this idea of doing good turns up again and again
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.900]   and again in 1 Peter.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.860]   It's one of his most common and distinctive phrases.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.100]   It turns up over and over as a general way
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.500]   of relating to all people, not just to those in authority.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.500]   And then even more amazing, Peter says in verse 17,
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.340]   honor everyone.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.660]   And in a sense, it's just as radical to say,
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.100]   honor every human creature as it is to say,
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.140]   be subject to every human creature,
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.140]   because certainly there are dishonorable humans,
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.580]   just as there are humans we should not obey.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.580]   So if there is a way to honor dishonorable humans,
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:11.040]   then there may be a way to be subject
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.460]   to humans that should not be obeyed.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.600]   Then in the next paragraph, verse 18,
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.540]   Peter tells slaves to be subject to their masters.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.260]   And then in the next paragraph, chapter three, verse one,
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.260]   he tells wives, likewise, be subject to your husbands.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.540]   And then to our surprise, my surprise anyway,
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.340]   he says in the next paragraph, chapter three, verse seven,
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.680]   likewise, that's the surprising word, husbands.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.540]   And then instead of saying, be subject to your wives,
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.060]   which he doesn't say, he says,
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.780]   husbands honor the woman as the weaker vessel
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.700]   and a fellow heir of the grace of life.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.460]   So he's not going to say that the role of the wife
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.900]   and the husband are interchangeable
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.660]   in terms of authority and submission,
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.660]   but he is going to say, just like he did back in 217,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.980]   where it says honor all people,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   that husbands are to honor their wives, all wives.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.540]   And he introduces this command with likewise,
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.940]   as if it is a kind of repetition
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.300]   of the commands for submission
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.980]   that he's been giving to us in our relation to government,
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.980]   relation to masters, relation to husbands.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.420]   And then add to this that Paul says,
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.900]   we are to do good to all people, Galatians 6:10,
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.740]   and that we are to be subject to each other, Ephesians 5:21,
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.820]   and that we should count others more significant
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.500]   than ourselves in the sense of becoming their servants,
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.100]   Philippians 2, 3.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   In all those pointers, I think, in 1 Peter and Paul,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.140]   I would say that Brent is onto something
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.540]   when he draws our attention to the fact
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.440]   that there is a sense in which Christians,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.420]   following the example of the humble, sacrificial,
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.420]   suffering Christ, should be subject for the Lord's sake
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.000]   to all people, in the sense, not of obeying,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   but in the sense of desiring earnestly to go low
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.180]   and to do what we can to lift them up into the truth
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.500]   and into faith and into righteousness
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.720]   and into everlasting joy.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.540]   So I think we should give Brent the benefit of the doubt here
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.120]   and say, that's pretty sharp,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.320]   and we ought to really consider that possibility.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.480]   - Yeah, that's a sharp question and suggestion.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.240]   Thank you, Brent, and thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.760]   And thank you all for joining us today.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.160]   You can ask a question of your own,

[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.880]   Well, how much jewelry is too much jewelry?
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.060]   It's a question we get from you all a lot,
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.160]   and it's worthy of addressing on this podcast
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.020]   because, well, because it's a topic in the Bible.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.040]   And speaking of 1 Peter,
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.480]   we will turn our attention to 1 Peter 3:3
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.680]   next up on the docket on Monday.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.960]   Have a great weekend, and we will see you then.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
