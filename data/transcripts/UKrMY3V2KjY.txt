[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.820]   - Welcome back on this Wednesday,
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.940]   a rare Wednesday episode with Pastor John
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.220]   and myself together.
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.380]   No sermon clip today.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.780]   We're both in the studio with an update.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.860]   This is John Piper's year in review,
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.380]   I guess we could call it, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.100]   As we look back at God's kindness to us in 2022,
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.900]   it was a busy year for you.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.520]   We have a lot of ground to cover today.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.560]   So let's start with the personal life of John Piper.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.060]   Don't go into the books or conferences
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.980]   or ministry memories just yet.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.440]   Start by giving us highlights from your life.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.620]   What stands out to you personally?
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.100]   - That's a trick question in a sense
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.900]   because pleasure personally and pleasure from ministry
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.260]   are really hard to distinguish.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.660]   So it seems to me like you're asking the impossible,
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.980]   but I think I get what you're asking.
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.020]   The joys of the personal dimension of my life,
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.140]   apart from the work I do for Desiring God
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.060]   and Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.620]   So let me mention maybe two or three things.
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.200]   Probably the least important thing to mention,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.860]   but amazingly ever present in our home life
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.700]   is that we got a new dog, a golden doodle.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.260]   Now we had a golden doodle for 14 years.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.260]   And this dog, however, is more doodle than golden.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.220]   So we're trying to come to terms with that
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.900]   and having a bit of a hard time.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.020]   So that's the least important thing to mention.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.380]   And yet there she is all the time in the kitchen
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.560]   as part of our lives now.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560]   Far more important was a once in a lifetime fishing trip
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.140]   with all four of my sons and two grandsons
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.740]   at a wilderness lake in Canada
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.860]   where you have to fly in, land on the water,
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460]   fish for walleye and Northern pike.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.980]   And these fish were so hungry.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.540]   They were so hungry.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.520]   We were catching them with hooks
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.820]   and pieces of orange duct tape.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.200]   That's really, that's not an exaggeration.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380]   My boys were having a blast experimenting.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.020]   What will they bite?
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.340]   And these were big, these were big fish, big edible fish.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.340]   So I love the sounds of my sons laughing.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.500]   And when you get four quick-witted, fast-tongued,
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.420]   Piper brothers together in one place,
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.380]   you better be prepared to be knocked over
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.820]   by the verbal rough and tumble and laughter.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.280]   It was a really precious high point,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.820]   which I pray God will use in their lives for good.
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.720]   Let me just mention one more, and it's cheating.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.560]   I know it's cheating
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.580]   because it mingles ministry, pleasure, and personal,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.380]   but I can't help but mention
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.060]   that I get a tremendous personal pleasure
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.660]   from teaching the preaching course
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.060]   at Bethlehem College and Seminary
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.660]   where I serve as chancellor.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.900]   I mean, the give and take with these 14 guys this fall,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.020]   for example, in the class about the glories
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.180]   of preaching God's word is simply too satisfying
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.020]   for me personally to leave out.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.060]   - I think probably most of us feel the same way
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.460]   that you do about ministry joys
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.620]   being mingled with personal joys.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.660]   But let's move into your ministry joys
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.040]   or your ministry highlights from 2022.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.960]   Given the fact that you and I are talking right now,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.180]   of course, means that in 2022,
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.420]   God enabled us to record another 150 episodes
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.100]   of this podcast of "Ask Pastor John."
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.900]   And we're closing in now on 1,900 total episodes
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.900]   as we finish up 10 years together on this podcast.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.500]   - That is so amazing, absolutely amazing.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.560]   I will get to say very often, Tony, in public at least,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.760]   though I might say it to you more often,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.360]   that I am so profoundly thankful
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.460]   for your partnership, Tony, particularly.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.060]   I know a lot of people make things happen at Desiring God,
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.900]   but the amount of planning, praying, curating,
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.940]   editing, hosting that you do for this podcast
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.460]   to make it possible is mostly invisible,
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.020]   but absolutely essential to the life of this ministry.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.540]   I am so thankful.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.500]   - That's very meaningful to me, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.820]   I've told you this before and I'll say it again,
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.540]   but "Ask Pastor John" is the honor of a lifetime for me.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.100]   This will be, I'm very sure of it,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.380]   the most impactful ministry I will ever be a part of.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.500]   You tell me, I cannot know that.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.900]   - Right, you cannot know that.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.060]   (both laughing)
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.620]   - But I'm saying I know that.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.180]   And I thank God for APJ,
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.700]   thank God for you and for your very hard work
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.880]   that is really the engine behind it all.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.660]   But I love building this podcast with you.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.500]   I enjoy every single week of this work
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.920]   because I know one day our building of it
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.060]   will come to an end and I do not look forward to that day.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.020]   APJ is not the only podcast you spend time on.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.160]   Maybe we shouldn't even classify it as a podcast,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.920]   but you spend a lot of time creating
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.100]   these almost unique visual online teaching videos
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.780]   called "Look at the Book."
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.340]   I think we have almost 1,000 of those episodes
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.220]   available right now at DesiringGod.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.940]   Is there anything unusual about this past year
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.620]   on the "Look at the Book" front?
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.580]   - Well, there is, but let me step back
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.540]   and give the bigger picture
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.020]   because what's special won't make as much sense without that.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.700]   Several years ago, God, I believe, put it in my heart
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.140]   to try to create a "Look at the Book" episode,
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.760]   these are about 10, 14 minutes long,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   on all 13 of Paul's letters.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.120]   So the team at DesiringGod thought that was an amazing thing
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.160]   and a good idea and got behind it
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.620]   and began to structure my life to that end,
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.360]   weaving "Look at the Book" creation into my weekly routine.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.720]   But we discovered that at the pace we were going,
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.200]   that's probably not gonna happen in my lifetime
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.240]   because that's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.080]   of episodes, given all of Paul's letters
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.320]   and how long some of them are.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.660]   So we decided to experiment last summer,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.920]   so just these months past,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.080]   with what we call a lab blitz.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.320]   So DesiringGod sends me away then for about seven weeks,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.840]   where that's all I do, is nothing but that,
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.720]   and bless their hearts,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.440]   Nine Marks and Capitol Hill Baptist Church
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.360]   provided Noel and me with a nice secluded place to stay.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.960]   And the guys from DesiringGod set up a studio in a bedroom,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.080]   and so nine hours a day, five days a week,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.080]   for seven weeks, all I did was look at the book creation.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.740]   And we did about 150 episodes in that time
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.000]   and did all the first and second Timothy.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So if we now take that model of these blitzes
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.720]   and do that for the next two or three years,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.800]   the goal actually looks doable.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.920]   It looks doable.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.940]   I mean, if God, we could drop dead anytime, right?
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.520]   No matter how old we are.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.600]   But if I stay healthy, if my mind stays clear
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.040]   for the next two or three years,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.560]   then it actually looks doable.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.960]   I love doing it this way.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.840]   I am so thankful, staying really focused day in, day out,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   is so much more efficient than fitting in to a day
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.040]   here and there during my other responsibilities,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.220]   those efforts at look at the book.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.480]   So we'll probably be doing both,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.000]   and I'm excited that it looks like if God gives me life,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I could do look at the book on all of Paul's letters.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.280]   - Wonderful.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.920]   Any special takeaways from seven weeks of your attention
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.560]   being riveted on Paul's letters?
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.760]   - Yes, but we don't have time to talk about it.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.900]   They're so good, so deep, so many.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.680]   You can't look at God's book
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.560]   as long as I have looked at it and not be amazed.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.160]   At least I can't.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.440]   So my prayer every time I start one of those days
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.700]   of focusing all day long on looking at God's book
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.200]   is, "Lord, open my eyes that I may see wonderful things
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.440]   "out of your word," like the psalmist prayed in Psalm 119.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.320]   But maybe what would be most interesting for folks
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.720]   is to see the connection between doing look at the book
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.720]   on 2 Timothy and a new book that will be out in a few weeks,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.680]   namely a book on the second coming of Christ,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.080]   which we're calling "Come, Lord Jesus,"
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.520]   that Crossway is publishing.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.600]   I've wanted to write a book
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.900]   on Christ's coming for many years.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.520]   Well, here I was focused.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.660]   Now, this was in last summer.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.780]   This was earlier as I was pondering 2 Timothy in preparation.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:12.160]   I was focused on 2 Timothy, and I got to the end.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.060]   This is probably his last letter,
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.120]   and these are among the last verses.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.680]   And he wrote in 2 Timothy 4, 7, and 8,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.720]   "I have fought the good fight.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.740]   "I have finished the race.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.860]   "I have kept the faith.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.920]   "Henceforth, there is laid up for me
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.740]   "the crown of righteousness,
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.320]   "which the Lord, the righteous judge,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.420]   "will award to me on that day,
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.600]   "and not only to me,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   "but to all who have loved his appearing."
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.160]   All who have loved his appearing, and that was it.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.080]   I mean, that's what it took to get me over the edge to say,
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.120]   "Now I know how I want to write this book
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.840]   "on the second coming."
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   So I wrote a book focused mainly on helping myself,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.520]   and I hope others love,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   not just hope for or understand or think about,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.840]   but love the appearing of the Lord Jesus.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.720]   And I finished the editing earlier this year,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.540]   and it's scheduled to be out, I believe,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.000]   in January sometime.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.920]   - Yeah, outstanding.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.320]   It's a great read.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.720]   And I guess that answers one of my other questions
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.440]   I had for you, whether this new look at the book Blitz
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.640]   that you just mentioned earlier
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.860]   will replace your other writing priorities.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.700]   - Well, it might.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.200]   I'm not sure yet about what it will look like
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.340]   over the summers for the next two or three years.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.760]   In fact, it's not going to in the foreseeable future
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.720]   to replace writing,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.240]   because we've set aside some time
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.760]   just a few weeks from now in January
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.680]   to team up with Joe Rigney,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.320]   the president of Bethlehem College Seminary,
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.820]   to write a short book on how to be a lifelong learner.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.560]   So I know that book is in the planning stages,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.380]   and the Blitzes aren't going to preempt that one.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.120]   But I'm, as you know,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.520]   not the only writer of books or articles at DG.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.340]   I mean, what an amazing,
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.040]   when I look back over this year,
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.600]   what an amazing stream of substantial,
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.480]   insightful, Bible-saturated articles
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   flow out daily at Desiring God,
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.860]   not to mention in this past year,
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.820]   the new books that you and David Mathis published this year.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.700]   I mean, Tony, your book,
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.100]   "God, Technology, and the Christian Life"
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.380]   is still, in my mind, in a class by itself.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.020]   I don't know anything like it
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.420]   with the combination of rich biblical reflection,
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.620]   high view of providence,
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.400]   fascinating grasp of the present lay of the land
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   of technology, and I've got juicy favorite quotes.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.860]   (laughs)
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.820]   I mean, you're a good writer,
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.740]   and you rise to some sweet levels of quotability.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.940]   And one of mine, I mean, here's two of them.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.500]   Angels don't bend down in awe of Silicon Valley.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.780]   Angels kneel in awe to study the glories
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.640]   and agonies of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.020]   I mean, that's gold.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.640]   Or obviously, we can escape from God's providence
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.220]   like a fish can escape water for a life in outer space.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.300]   (laughs)
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.360]   That's great.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.920]   So your book is worthy of people's getting
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.040]   just to poke around and find those nuggets like that.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.840]   And as if that were not enough
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.560]   for a great year at Desiring God,
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.280]   Mathis, David Mathis, our executive editor,
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.920]   published a book for church leaders.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.320]   It's called Workers for Your Joy.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.720]   And I think it's one of a kind
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.840]   because there are a lot of books on eldership, right?
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.960]   A lot of books on pastoring.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.520]   Goodness, there are hundreds of them.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   But there are not a lot built on 2 Corinthians 1:24
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.960]   with the point that we are workers with our people
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.800]   for their joy.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.280]   That's the note of the book.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.080]   This is Christian hedonism pressed into the corners
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.600]   of the leader's life.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.320]   It was a great year of publishing, I think.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.600]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.120]   You have not mentioned yet your book, though,
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.640]   What is Saving Faith?
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.920]   That was also published in 2022.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.640]   In fact, just a few weeks ago,
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.560]   at the annual meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.960]   in Denver, a whole three-hour block
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.680]   was devoted to your book.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   Why was that?
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.480]   And that's never happened before, I don't think, has it,
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.440]   that one of your books would be part of a debate at ETS?
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.360]   - No, no, that was a first, I think.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.280]   And I was really glad for it.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.760]   I feel privileged that that happened.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.220]   The book has stirred up some discussion
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.960]   because not everyone agrees with my main point,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.120]   namely that true saving faith has in it
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   an affectional or heartfelt dimension,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.760]   which I call treasuring Christ.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.200]   So saving faith is a receiving of Christ
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   as a treasured Savior, a treasured Lord.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.720]   Without that treasuring aspect,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.120]   I think we may be just using Christ, competent,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   but not trusting Him as an all-satisfying Savior.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.800]   So I was really glad for the ETS event
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   to try to bring some clarity to the pushback we've received.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.520]   And I hope people will read it for themselves
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.100]   rather than just what others are saying.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.100]   I think there are not many issues more important
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.160]   than whether we really have true saving faith.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.000]   - Hmm, amen.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.040]   Well, we're over time.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.600]   We need to wind this up.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.320]   Any other encouraging things that you see
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.040]   at Desiring God more broadly
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.080]   that you think our listeners might be interested in?
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   - I think what is most exciting and most worthy
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.520]   of thanksgiving to God and to our financial supporters
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   is the incredible expansion of the ministry globally.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:52.980]   We now have something like 30 partners worldwide
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:58.940]   translating, ask Pastor John, books, articles.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:04.460]   It's simply remarkable what God is doing globally
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.700]   to raise up young leaders with a passion
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.500]   for the glory of God and for publishing,
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.400]   and that are amazingly savvy on the internet
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.960]   for everywhere in the world.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.460]   This is invisible to most people.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.620]   This growth, this exciting dimension of our ministry
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.520]   is mostly invisible for people,
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.560]   and yet may be the most important thing
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.720]   we are doing right now at Desiring God,
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.960]   namely partnering with these brothers and sisters
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.520]   as an increasing part of our annual plan
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.200]   and our annual budget.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.760]   So I think this is a great place to end the year,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.520]   end update, thanking God for what He's doing
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   outside of our little sphere called America
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.400]   through this ministry.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.000]   - Amen, yeah.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.780]   Speaking of God's work outside of America,
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.800]   this year included for me my first international trip ever,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.080]   preaching in Brazil in June
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.520]   to launch my technology book in Portuguese.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.600]   It launched there this summer,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.720]   and I got to hold the translation in hand,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.520]   and I met and spent time with the translator there,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.320]   and I had lunch with our friend Vinny,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.960]   who is one of the important contacts we have in Brazil,
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.440]   translating our resources.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.060]   And so all this international work you just mentioned
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.000]   became very tangible for me for the first time in 2022,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.920]   because I think if all you know is Desiring God,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.800]   the English website and the English resources that we create,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.840]   there is a whole other world of labor happening right now
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.720]   that we wanna introduce you to
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.000]   so that you can see it for yourself.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.600]   And we're going to introduce you
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.720]   to that work beginning next time.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.840]   We have 30 international partners,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.960]   as you said, Pastor John, at least,
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.800]   and we're gonna hear from seven of them
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.280]   in the next seven APJ episodes,
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.560]   brief updates from leaders reaching the world
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.000]   through the languages of French and Portuguese
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   and Farsi and Dutch and German and Arabic and Albanian.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.160]   Each of these seven updates are incredible.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.880]   They inspire me to ministry,
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.600]   and it's my joy to share them with you
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.160]   in these final weeks of the year.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.120]   - Amen.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.600]   - And if you're hearing all these updates and you want in,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.800]   you can join us today.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.680]   We're looking for new ministry partners like you
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.360]   to come alongside us, to support us
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.140]   as we continue to make new resources in English,
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.760]   including our books and articles
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.640]   and look at the book videos and this podcast as well.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.000]   And as we get these resources translated
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.880]   and distributed across the globe in dozens of languages,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.560]   we can only do all this with your help.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.680]   So consider becoming a monthly ministry partner with us.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.520]   Today, much of our financial support
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.800]   comes from friends of ours who give on average $30 a month
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.080]   to support all of this work,
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.680]   everything we mentioned today and more.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.320]   To set up monthly giving, go to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.120]   That's give.desiringgod.org.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.320]   It is very much appreciated.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.640]   Pastor John and I are back next time.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.580]   We will see you on Friday.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:23.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
