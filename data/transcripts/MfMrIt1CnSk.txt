[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.160]   Since we are His loved children,
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.740]   we have the capacity now to imitate God.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.420]   If you want the greatest expression of love,
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.880]   you only need to listen to the words of Jesus.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.800]   If you're gonna be an imitator of God,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.880]   then you need to be characterized
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.000]   by that which is most definitive of God,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.800]   and that is His love that forgives.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.320]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.240]   I determined to know nothing among you
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.820]   except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:01:04.100]   We come now to the Word of God, the Scripture,
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100]   and I ask you to open your Bible to Ephesians,
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.800]   the book of Ephesians,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.480]   as we are working our way through Ephesians
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.780]   and find ourselves at chapter 5, Ephesians chapter 5.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.200]   And this becomes for us a high point.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   That's hard to say with regard to Ephesians
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.120]   because everything seems like a high point.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.920]   But this is indeed a high point.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.160]   This wonderful passage begins in the clouds.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   It begins in the lofty heavenly stratosphere
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.760]   of being imitators of God.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   And it ends down on earth with the sinful lists
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   that are provided for us, which we are to avoid,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   that lead finally, as verse 6 says, to the wrath of God.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   And again, we are reminded that we are to have no part with that.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.760]   And that is a theme all through the book of Ephesians.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   We saw that, didn't we, back in chapter 4 and verse 22.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.740]   It says, "The Lord is with you."
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.060]   If you are a believer in Christ, you had a former life,
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.600]   but you laid aside the old self,
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.740]   which is being corrupted in accordance
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.380]   with the lusts of deceit.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.620]   You were renewed in the spirit of your mind,
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.620]   and you put on the new self, which in the likeness of God
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.780]   has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.180]   This is the very main thrust of this wonderful epistle.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.180]   And I've been pointing you back to chapter 2, verse 10.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.180]   "We are, as those who have been saved, the workmanship of God,
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.180]   created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.180]   which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180]   We've been learning from the book of Ephesians
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.180]   that salvation is a total transformation.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180]   It is complete change.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.180]   It is going 180 miles an hour.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.180]   It is going 180 miles an hour.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.180]   It is going 180 degrees in the opposite direction.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.180]   It is ceasing to be under the authority and power of Satan,
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.180]   as it tells us in the beginning of chapter 2,
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.180]   "Walking according to the course of this world,
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.180]   according to the prince of the power of the air,
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.180]   the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience."
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180]   It ceases to be that.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.180]   And instead of walking in the power of Satan,
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.180]   chapter 3 ends with verse 19, saying,
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.180]   "We now can be filled up to all the glory
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.180]   and all the fullness of God."
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.180]   That's how dramatic the transformation is.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.180]   And again, this seems to be a question asked so many, many times.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.180]   "How do I know I am a true Christian?"
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.180]   And we've learned the answers very clearly
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180]   through the book of Ephesians,
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.180]   and we'll see it again this morning.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.180]   Now, we are called to something in verse 1 of chapter 5
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.180]   that may on its surface seem like too high a standard.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.180]   Verse 1: "Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children,
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   and walk in love."
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.180]   "Be imitators of God as beloved children."
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.180]   Since we are His loved children,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180]   since He loved us enough to make us His children,
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.180]   and since as a result of that we have become partakers of the divine nature,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.180]   that's what Peter says,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.180]   we have become partakers of the divine nature,
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.180]   we have the capacity now to imitate God,
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.180]   and in one particular way: walking in love.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.180]   So with this opening of chapter 5,
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.180]   we come to the main issue in your life as a Christian:
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.180]   love, love,
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.180]   and love that is basically defined
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.180]   by its eagerness and its willingness to forgive.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.180]   If you want the greatest expression of love,
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180]   you only need to listen to the words of Jesus.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.180]   It's not sentiment, it's sacrifice.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.180]   Listen to John 15:13:
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.180]   "Greater love has no man than this,
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.180]   that a man lay down his life for his friends."
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.180]   The greatest act of love possible
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.180]   is complete self-sacrifice,
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.180]   even giving your life, if necessary,
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.180]   in death for someone else.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.180]   Now, none of us have done that,
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.180]   or your funeral would already have taken place,
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.180]   but you're here.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180]   This is an extreme kind of love
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.180]   that reaches out to someone who is not perfect,
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.180]   someone who is not deserving,
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.180]   and says, "I will give my life for you.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.180]   I will die that you might live."
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.180]   That is essentially what Christ did.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.180]   Romans tells us in chapter 5
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180]   that while we were yet sinners,
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.180]   Christ died for us.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.180]   This is the call to that kind of love,
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.180]   the love that forgives, as verse 32 says,
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.180]   "as God in Christ has forgiven you."
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.180]   1 John 2:12 puts it this way:
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.180]   "Your sins have been forgiven,"
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.180]   and then it says, "for His name's sake."
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.180]   It really, in the primary sense, isn't for you,
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.180]   although you're a beneficiary of it.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.180]   It's for the fame of God.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.180]   It's for the glory of God.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.180]   He forgives sin to put His grace on display,
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.180]   to put His mercy on display,
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.180]   to put His compassion on display,
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.180]   to put His love on display,
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.180]   and to put it on display everlastingly.
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.180]   Throughout all eternity in the new heavens
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.180]   and the new earth,
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.180]   we will, along with the redeemed of all the ages
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.180]   and the holy angels,
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.180]   praise God endlessly and eternally
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.180]   for His forgiveness,
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.180]   for His forgiveness.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.180]   The point is simple:
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.180]   you can't love like God
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:20.180]   unless you are marked by forgiveness.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.180]   Unless, if you want to be like God,
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.180]   you act toward people who offend you
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.180]   the way God acts toward people
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.180]   who offended Him.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.180]   Jesus said in Luke 6
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.180]   that you need to show mercy
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.180]   as your Father in heaven showed mercy.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.180]   This is the characteristic of God
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.180]   that Paul is driving at.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.180]   This kind of love
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.180]   is so extensive.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.180]   Go to the end of chapter 3,
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.180]   at least down to verse 1,
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.180]   and you'll see that it's a very,
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.180]   very simple thing to do.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.180]   It's a very simple thing to do.
