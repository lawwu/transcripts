[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   [silence]
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.040]   We all think of caffeine as a stimulant that we drink.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.080]   I certainly drink coffee and yerba mate,
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.200]   the occasional energy drink, things of that sort.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.680]   Caffeine does many things besides stimulate
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.680]   our central nervous system
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.080]   and make us feel less sleepy, however.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.060]   One of the things that caffeine does
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.840]   is it is a fairly potent PDE inhibitor.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.080]   By being a potent PDE inhibitor,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.960]   it indirectly stimulates IGF-1.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.800]   Why?
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.200]   Well, because PDE can suppress IGF-1
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.520]   and by ingesting caffeine
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.440]   or by applying topical caffeine ointment
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.360]   or cream to the scalp,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.520]   you can suppress PDE sufficiently enough to increase IGF-1
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.680]   and increase some hair growth
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.120]   or at least maintain hair growth in that region.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.600]   This may come as a shock,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.560]   it might seem a little bit esoteric
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.720]   or even outside the margins of typical treatments,
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.640]   but head-to-head topical caffeine application
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.560]   can be as effective as minoxidil application
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.240]   without actually lowering things like blood pressure
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.280]   and potentially increasing prolactin
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.200]   and some of the other negative,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.020]   let's call them negative
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.860]   because they are side effects of minoxidil.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.480]   So caffeine ointments and caffeine
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.900]   present in various hair treatments and creams, et cetera,
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.960]   is starting to become a more prominent theme out there.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.480]   I will include a reference to caffeine
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.520]   and its uses for offsetting hair loss.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.360]   Keep in mind that topical caffeine ointments
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.920]   shouldn't necessarily be applied every single day.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.480]   So this is the sort of thing you might do three times a week.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.400]   The concentration of caffeine in different ointments
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800]   varies tremendously.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.160]   Most of the studies of caffeine on the stem cell niches
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.180]   that control hair growth
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.560]   and extension of the antigen phase of hair growth
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560]   have been performed in vitro in a dish.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.880]   Although there are some clinical studies exploring this,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.880]   they are not nearly as extensive in number or duration
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.280]   as the studies of minoxidil
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.000]   because this approach just hasn't been around
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   quite as long.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.560]   However, when comparing side effects of minoxidil,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.000]   cost of minoxidil,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.520]   comparing the efficacy of caffeine and minoxidil,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.560]   I think caffeine as a topical treatment
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   for offsetting hair loss
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.900]   stands as a pretty good choice
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.240]   if you're going to start exploring this pathway.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240]   And there's no reason to think
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.140]   that if you were to try the caffeine ointment
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.120]   and it didn't work for you
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.420]   or you didn't like it for some reason
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.240]   or you needed to stop it for some reason
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.640]   that you couldn't stop it safely
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.760]   because it doesn't carry all the other
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.200]   blood pressure related effects and prolactinemia effects
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.520]   that minoxidil does.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.160]   So if you look out there into the hair maintenance
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.480]   and hair replacement literature,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   you look at the treatments that are being sold,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.000]   don't be surprised to see caffeine there.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.840]   And also don't be surprised
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.280]   when I tell you what I'm about to tell you now,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.240]   which is no, you can't simply just drink more caffeine
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.700]   in order to accomplish the goal of offsetting hair loss.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.360]   It is true that when you ingest caffeine,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.720]   it goes systemically.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.440]   However, you have so many adenosine receptors
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.320]   throughout your body.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.120]   Those adenosine receptors and the parking of caffeine
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200]   in those adenosine receptors is the main way
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.520]   in which caffeine exerts its stimulatory effects,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   making you feel less sleepy.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.960]   So it does that because then adenosine
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.600]   can't have its effects, which are to make you sleepy.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   Well, those adenosine receptors soak up
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.080]   so much of the caffeine that you would ingest orally
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   that very, very little would make it to the scalp
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.260]   and to the hair follicles at the concentrations
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.100]   that you would want.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.040]   So that's why you have to rely on the application
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.360]   of these caffeine ointments about three times a week.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.180]   Keep in mind that no one has really explored the dosages
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.540]   of caffeine in these ointments in a systematic way.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.920]   We're still in the early stages of all this,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.620]   but I do think it's important to mention caffeine
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.260]   because of the lower incidence of side effects,
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.480]   at least reported side effects,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.640]   and the general safety margins and the head-to-head,
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.840]   essentially comparable efficacy with minoxidil
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.200]   because minoxidil has a bunch of other issues.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.040]   Now, keep in mind that both minoxidil and caffeine
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.640]   are generally used as a preventative
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520]   for reducing hair loss over time.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.880]   They are not expected, and they do not, as far as we know,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.440]   create new hair growth to any sufficient degree.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.960]   If any of you have used caffeine ointments or minoxidil
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.680]   and observed new hair growth that was robust,
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.040]   please put that in the comment section.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.960]   I'd be curious about those experiences.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.800]   But as far as I know,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.960]   and from the clinical literature that I read,
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600]   there's no examples of that.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.360]   One other point about caffeine,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.800]   it does appear that caffeine can not only
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.560]   indirectly stimulate IGF-1
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.880]   in the antigen phase of hair cell growth
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.640]   by way of reducing PDE and TGF-beta,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.400]   but it also seems to reduce apoptosis,
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.380]   which is naturally occurring cell death
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.920]   of that stem cell niche.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.240]   We've been talking a lot about the antigen
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.380]   or growth phase of hair.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.980]   We also talked about the catagen
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.660]   or the recession of that hair from the inside out.
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.980]   But remember that third phase, the tillagen phase,
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.760]   where that whole bulb down at the bottom,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.800]   the bulges, it's called, gets pinched off
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.680]   and the whole thing dies
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.120]   and takes the stem cells off to the grave with it.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.680]   It appears that caffeine can offset the death of that niche
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.120]   and potentially maintain the stem cell population longer,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.220]   making caffeine a really good choice
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.160]   to think about in conjunction
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.560]   with the various chemical treatments
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.640]   aimed at directly attacking the DHT pathway
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.000]   that we'll talk about next.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.580]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.860]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.640]   (upbeat music)
