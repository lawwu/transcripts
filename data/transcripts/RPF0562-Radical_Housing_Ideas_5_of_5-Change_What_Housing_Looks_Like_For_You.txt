[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.700]   everyone.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:42.700]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.700]   Today we round out the Radical Housing Ideas series with part number five.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700]   And this series is by no means exhaustive.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.320]   But I've tried to provide some creative ideas that I hope will stimulate your thinking a little bit.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   So that you'll look around at your own situation,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:25.980]  , and try to put together something that gets you a little farther ahead than the conventional path.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.020]   And point number five is rather obvious, but I would be remiss if I didn't address it.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.120]   And simply this:
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   Could you change the nature of the housing that you're willing to accept?
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.160]   I talk quite a bit about this with my wife, and I'm so blessed that she's a very flexible person.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.200]   She's not high maintenance. She's willing to think flexibly after all.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.360]   She's willing to think flexibly after all.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.400]   She's willing to think flexibly after all.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   She's willing to think flexibly after all.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.480]   She's willing to think flexibly after all.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.360]   flexibly after all.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   I'm willing to think about all.
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.240]   She's really wonderful in that regard.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.980]   But there's so many benefits that you gain if you're willing to be flexible in your approach.
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.520]   And I have so many friends who are great people and wonderful, but they're just not flexible.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.940]   I don't think you have to be flexible.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.560]   We're not talking here in the area of morally right and wrong things,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.400]   but you can choose how you want to live your life.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.400]  ÐµÑ€Ñ‚Ð²ed.

[00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:21.280]   It's pretty miserable to be out in the heat and to be out in the cold. So you need to be protected from the elements. If you've provided that, do you know how easily almost all of the other conveniences can be provided? Do you know how easy it is to provide some basic water? Some basic way to deal with your human waste? It's not tough at all. And it can be done in a variety of formats.

But they're living very well and having their housing provided, but in a unique way. Now, you may not want to be a nomad. So, look at a stationary form. Why do we live in houses? Well, there are many benefits to them. They're certainly comfortable. But you can also live in different climates, very comfortable and think comfortable.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:53.120]   and think comfortable. And, you know, I'm not saying that you should live in a tent. You can live very well in a tent. You can live very well in a yurt. You can live very well in a log cabin. You can live very well in a garage. You can live very well in a shed that you fix up for yourself. You can live very well in a shed that you fix up for yourself.

[00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:22.280]   You can live very well in a mobile wagon. You can live very well in many circumstances. I wouldn't necessarily trade the comfort of a conventional house for something that's just less comfortable. But if you get something in return for it, for example, what am I getting by moving from a conventional house into an RV? Well, I'm getting an additional benefit of flexibility and travel, and it happens to be relatively inexpensive.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.140]   and travel, and it happens to be relatively inexpensive.

[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   Well, that's great, but I'm not doing it primarily for the finances, I'm doing it for the flexibility of the travel that it gives me. I like that. You may like it because you can live in a beautiful place. Let's say that you move into a beautiful forest and you set up a yurt. Well, the yurt's only going to last you for ten years, but you can set up a beautiful yurt to live in. Or you can buy a big canvas wall tent. You can set it up and be warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and you can have luxury furniture, and you can be warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and you can have luxury furniture and you can have luxury furniture and you can have luxury furniture and you can buy a big canvas wall tent.

[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:45.740]   while you're working in that process and you can live in a trailer in the backyard or set up a nice wall tent.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:55.320]   I mean, even if you don't have a trailer, you set up a nice wall tent on a nice grassy patch outside of a, let's say you build a deck and the deck's going to go on the back of the house, but you go ahead and set up a tent there.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:06.740]   You put in a nice comfortable bed and a nice comfortable chair and you, you can experience all the same things while being there on the property and you can put that together with, with the fact that you're working on that job while you are also managing.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:34.280]  .
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.760]   curbside, somebody else's property and you're getting your housing provided at your own, at your own house. I mean, these ideas are not mutually exclusive. So look for some variation of them in your own life and look for some way to synthesize these and just use them as hopefully a little bit of creative fodder to help you figure out some smart move that is appropriate to your context, your city, your town, your country, your climate, your interest, your skills, your goals, your family, and just put them together and you're good to go.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:42.020]   The second thing I would say is with regard to timing.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:48.540]   One of the major challenges we have is the ability to appreciate how life changes over time.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:59.300]   And so frequently, I think we, we try to get ahead of ourselves with regard to time and we don't recognize that there are different times in life at which different things are appropriate.
