[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.900]   Today, we round out the Radical Housing Ideas series
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.240]   with part number five.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.640]   And this series is by no means exhaustive,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.180]   but I've tried to provide some creative ideas
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.580]   that I hope will stimulate your thinking a little bit
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.720]   so that you'll look around at your own situation
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.060]   and try to put together something
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.220]   that gets you a little farther ahead
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.960]   than the conventional path.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.360]   And point number five is rather obvious,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600]   but I would be remiss if I didn't address it.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.160]   And it's simply this.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.600]   Could you change the nature of the housing
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.000]   that you're willing to accept?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.480]   I talked quite a bit about this with my wife,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.880]   and I'm so blessed that she's a very flexible person.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.380]   She's not high maintenance.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.780]   She's willing to think flexibly.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.780]   After all, she was willing to move into
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.920]   a 30-foot travel trailer with me and our children
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.220]   and our dogs.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.960]   She's really wonderful in that regard.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.400]   But there's so many benefits that you gain
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700]   if you're willing to be flexible in your approach.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.540]   And I have so many friends who are great people
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.260]   and wonderful, but they're just not flexible.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.640]   I don't think you have to be flexible.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.400]   We're not talking here in the area
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.240]   of morally right and wrong things.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.640]   But you can choose how you want to live your life.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.780]   And that's fine.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.340]   And of course, you don't have to live like me,
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.180]   and I hope you don't.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.840]   Just live like yourself.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.020]   But if you're willing to be flexible,
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.580]   man, there's so many options available to you.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.460]   There's so many different things that might work for you.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.700]   And if you can just change the nature
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.400]   of what you think is appropriate housing,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.540]   just a little bit,
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.000]   the world can open up to you
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.340]   and your finances can really open up as well.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.140]   If you've never traveled outside of the United States,
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.740]   I would encourage you,
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.020]   find a way to travel outside of the United States
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.620]   and try to go to a place that is not
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.420]   on the major beaten tourist path.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.020]   And what you will find is that all over the world,
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.760]   people live in very unique circumstances.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   They live in unique housing conditions.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.000]   They live in unique houses.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.660]   And what other people would call a house,
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.000]   you might not call a house.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.780]   Some people live under a cardboard box.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.440]   Some people take their cardboard box,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.800]   they stack up a couple of pallets
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.840]   and they throw a sheet of tin on top.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.780]   Some people live on a dirt floor.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.020]   And your ancestors did the same thing.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.080]   If you go back just a generation or two,
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.360]   you will find that the circumstances that people lived in,
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.920]   that the actual physical outworking of their house
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.420]   was very different than today.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.340]   As thinking about the Laura Ingalls Wilder books
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.840]   for children, there was a recent kerfuffle
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.080]   over the renaming of a literary award.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.000]   And I was thinking about the books
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.280]   as a consequence of that.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.840]   And I loved those books.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.240]   One of the things that I really loved about those books
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.680]   and love about those books
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.160]   is how many different ways the housing was provided.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.520]   So if you think back to the story,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.520]   if you've never read the series
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.880]   or if your children don't read the series,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.600]   really wonderful series.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.980]   And if you go back to the original series,
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.960]   then the family lived in this comfortable house
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.720]   in, I think it was Wisconsin.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.300]   And then they moved to the frontier
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.060]   and Paul Ingalls built a house out of logs
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.420]   with his own hands.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.040]   And he built this frontier house.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.000]   But then for whatever reason, the family moved
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.840]   and they eventually moved into a dugout,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.120]   a dugout on the side of a creek basically.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.960]   And then they moved, if memory is right,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.000]   they moved west and they moved into a sod house.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.400]   If you've ever traveled out in the Western United States
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   and you see these houses just made out of sod,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.800]   that was what they had to build a house out of, a dugout.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.360]   And then they moved into a board house that they upgraded.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.000]   And there's no question that the board house
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.900]   was better than the sod house.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.840]   But all along the way,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.920]   they lived in all these different circumstances
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.000]   and they made it work.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.960]   If you go back, that's what's in your heritage.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.800]   No matter where you're from,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.560]   if you're from another continent, your heritage,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.880]   the original housing looked different.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.120]   But here's what's interesting if you go back.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.180]   Housing was always a utility.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.680]   It provided people something basic
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.840]   that they needed for their life, a place to live.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.280]   It wasn't just a luxury expense.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.840]   And if you can adjust your flexibility and thinking,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.960]   and you can go back to housing as a utility
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.340]   and think about what provides for you,
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.200]   it opens up your options.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.880]   I love luxury housing.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.800]   I think luxury housing is cool.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.940]   I enjoy being in beautiful houses,
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.480]   but I'm not gonna sell my life away
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.560]   to pay for a luxury house,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.120]   especially at the beginning of life,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.320]   when I haven't yet established a fortune to support me.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.340]   You make your own decision.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.280]   That's not how I wanna live.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.560]   I'd rather look first at housing as utility
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.660]   and figure out how to provide housing.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.340]   (air whooshing)
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.940]   So what are the requirements of housing?
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.060]   Well, you primarily wanna be protected from the elements.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.220]   That's the first thing.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.220]   It's pretty miserable to be out in the heat
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.140]   and to be out in the cold.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.440]   So you need to be protected from the elements.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.620]   If you've provided that,
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.620]   do you know how easily
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.980]   almost all of the other conveniences can be provided?
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.740]   Do you know how easy it is to provide some basic water,
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.520]   some basic way to deal with your human waste?
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.780]   It's not tough at all,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.940]   and it can be done in a variety of formats.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.580]   So I don't know what that looks like for you.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.740]   Some people move into their car.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.700]   Some people move into a nice van.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.820]   There are so many wonderful ways
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.260]   that you could change a van to live in
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.380]   and be totally comfortable,
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.620]   be warm in the winter, cool in the summer,
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.820]   provide for water, food for yourself,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.620]   provide for a way to deal with your human waste.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.640]   So doable.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.000]   All throughout the world,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.360]   you'll find cultures of gypsies and migrants
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.200]   and people who are nomads.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.720]   Some nomads move on camels.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.740]   Some nomads move their yurts by tractors.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.400]   Some nomads live in wagons.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.980]   Some nomads live in vans and RVs.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.900]   But they're living very well
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.000]   and having their housing provided,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.200]   but in a unique way.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.920]   Now you may not want to be a nomad.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.640]   So look at a stationary form.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.600]   Why do we live in houses?
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.920]   Well, there are many benefits to them.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.820]   They're certainly comfortable,
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.020]   but you can also live in different climates
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.160]   very comfortably in things that are not houses.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.760]   When it's the coldest of the cold
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.040]   or the hottest of the hot,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.580]   you'll often find it difficult to live well.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.940]   But if you live in a temperate climate,
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.720]   you can live very well in a tent.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.680]   You can live very well in a yurt.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.200]   You can live very well in a log cabin.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.580]   You can live very well in a garage.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.800]   You can live very well in a shed
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.520]   that you fix up for yourself.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.420]   You can live very well in a mobile wagon.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.760]   You can live very well in many circumstances.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.720]   I wouldn't necessarily trade the comfort
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.080]   of a conventional house
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.920]   for something that's just less comfortable.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.460]   But if you get something in return for it,
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.820]   for example, what am I getting
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.080]   by moving from a conventional house into an RV?
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.240]   Well, I'm getting an additional benefit
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   of flexibility and travel,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.600]   and it happens to be relatively inexpensive.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.440]   Well, that's great,
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.520]   but I'm not doing it primarily for the finances.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.600]   I'm doing it for the flexibility
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.420]   of the travel that it gives me.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.260]   I like that.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.160]   You may like it because you can live in a beautiful place.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.960]   Let's say that you move into a beautiful forest
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.540]   and you set up a yurt.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.680]   Well, the yurt's only gonna last you for 10 years,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.760]   but you can set up a beautiful yurt to live in.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.120]   Or you can buy a big canvas wall tent,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.040]   and you can set it up,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.320]   and you can be warm in the winter and cool in the summer,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.000]   and you can have luxury furniture
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.520]   and live very comfortably,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.120]   while also recognizing that your house
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.900]   is not gonna last more than five or 10 years.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.820]   Now, there are compelling arguments
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.240]   in favor of traditional architecture.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.360]   The more I study unconventional architecture,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.100]   the more I appreciate certain things
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.260]   about conventional architecture.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.200]   But expand your thinking.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.740]   Test your assumptions.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.180]   Do a little bit of reading.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.380]   Do a little bit of looking.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.820]   Do a little bit of considering.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.900]   Do a little bit of thinking.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.340]   Do a little bit of exploration.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.160]   Do a little bit of web searching.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.440]   Just challenge yourself.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.480]   I don't know if these non-normal ways
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.600]   are more popular now than they were in the past.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.540]   I think they're always pretty popular.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.320]   But I think it's easier for you to connect with people
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.040]   who are living less conventional lifestyles
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.760]   than it's ever been.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.200]   I think there've always been people
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.480]   who've lived unconventional lifestyles,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.920]   but it's not been so easy for those people
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.220]   to communicate that to others.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.040]   Whereas today, you'll find all kinds of people
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.000]   living unconventional lifestyles
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.840]   and sharing that with the world.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.480]   So explore those things just a little bit.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.120]   Here's what I've learned.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.640]   At the very least, it'll make you appreciate
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.840]   your normal thing, your normal conventional things
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.940]   better than you, more than you did before.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.720]   I used to, when we used to go on vacation,
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.400]   my parents would joke when they returned home
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.480]   that the point of a vacation
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.440]   is to make you appreciate home.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.920]   Hasn't that been your experience at least a little bit?
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.880]   When you go into something different,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.320]   then you appreciate something about the old.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.800]   Living in an RV right now,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.440]   I appreciate some of those things
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.340]   that were nice about an apartment or a house.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.660]   There are things that I don't have right now
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.720]   that I would really appreciate
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.680]   that you, if you're living in an apartment or house,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.980]   probably take for granted.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.300]   I'm not running away from it.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.560]   I'm gonna take and appreciate the certain benefits
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.480]   of living in a trailer.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.360]   But there are a lot of benefits
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.280]   that you just kind of gloss over.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.560]   And that's really good.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.360]   Meaning it's good to appreciate those things.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.040]   I'm gonna close out this mini series
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.840]   with this one, with two closing thoughts.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.240]   One, none of these ideas are mutually exclusive.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.760]   So I could easily see a way to
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:25.000]   integrate all five of these ideas into one path.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.360]   And in a way, the ideas are not all that unique.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.320]   They're not all that original.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.920]   It's not like I made them all up
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.960]   and it's the first time they've ever been experienced
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.020]   in the world.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.280]   But you can learn the skills and build your own house
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.900]   and you can live in the house while you fix it up.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.960]   And you can rent out different rooms
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.540]   while you're working in that process.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.840]   And you can live in a trailer in the backyard
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.080]   or set up a nice wall tent.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.000]   I mean, even if you don't have a trailer,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.360]   you set up a nice wall tent on a nice grassy patch
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.300]   outside of a, or let's say you build a deck
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.320]   and the deck's gonna go on the back of the house,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.900]   but you go ahead and set up a tent there.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.360]   You put in a nice comfortable bed
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.520]   and a nice comfortable chair.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.920]   And you can experience all the same things
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.480]   while being there on the property.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.840]   And you can put that together with the fact
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.560]   that you're working on that job
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.320]   while you are also managing somebody else's property
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.000]   and you're getting your housing provided
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.560]   at your own house.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.760]   I mean, these ideas are not mutually exclusive.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.800]   So look for some variation of them in your own life
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.640]   and look for some way to synthesize these
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.560]   and just use them as hopefully a little bit
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.280]   of creative fodder to help you figure out
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.160]   some smart move that is appropriate to your context,
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.640]   your city, your town, your country, your climate,
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.100]   your interest, your skills, your goals, your family,
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.360]   and just put them together
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.500]   or come up with something better.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.400]   The second thing I would say is with regard to timing.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.520]   One of the major challenges we have
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.800]   is the ability to appreciate how life changes over time.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.240]   And so frequently, I think we try to get ahead of ourselves
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.200]   with regard to time and we don't recognize
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.000]   that there are different times in life
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.800]   at which different things are appropriate.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.120]   I've observed among my generation
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.080]   that many people in my generation
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.440]   are trying to live their parents' lifestyles
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.980]   without having had the benefit
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.600]   of decades of their parents' incomes.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.560]   And that's tough.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.440]   It's tough because if you come along
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.560]   and your parents are established at 45, 40, 40 years old,
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.660]   you start to become aware
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.440]   when your parents are in their mid-40s,
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.360]   they've had two and a half decades probably
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.440]   of earning, saving, investing,
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.600]   and they can live in wonderful circumstances.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.040]   But so many people of my generation,
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.480]   because they're raised in opulence and affluence,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.560]   tend to forget the fact
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.580]   that their parents probably didn't start there.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.160]   Their parents probably started in a starter home,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.380]   not an estate home.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.480]   Their parents probably started in a small place
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.280]   and as their family expanded, they expanded their space.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.200]   But what that happens is if you come along
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.760]   or you're the youngest like I am in my family
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.200]   and you've always lived in a big house,
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.640]   you haven't known what it was like.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.160]   I remember a time when I was growing up
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.800]   when my parents had four boys in a tiny bedroom
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.720]   that was just big enough to take two bunk beds and a dresser.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.880]   I can visualize it, but I didn't, I lived there just,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.160]   I know I lived there because it was a historical fact,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.000]   but I didn't actually live there such that I remember it.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.880]   All of my life, I lived in a giant house.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.640]   But in hindsight, I can go back and analyze and recognize
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.800]   that, wait a second, it wasn't always like this.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.200]   And so that helps me to feel better
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.840]   where I don't feel like a loser
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.380]   because I'm not living at my parents' lifestyle.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:41.600]   I didn't see my parents when they were at my stage of life.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.080]   So recognize that you can't compress
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.280]   what other people have in several decades
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.400]   into what you can have right now.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.800]   And also recognize the fact that life will change.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.560]   You don't always need little places to live
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.480]   and you don't always need big places to live.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.200]   I was naive and did not recognize this fact a decade ago.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   I thought in the sense,
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.160]   I thought constantly with the idea of permanence.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.200]   I remember when my wife and I bought our first house
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.560]   together, I thought it was gonna be a 40-year house.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.440]   I planned for it to be a 40-year house.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.440]   It wasn't a 40-year house.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.640]   But I didn't know then what I didn't know.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.360]   Obviously I was naive, I was ignorant.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.600]   But in hindsight, I see now that it's valuable
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.920]   to be able to recognize that life requires
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.560]   different options at different times.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.240]   And so you don't always need the same thing.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.520]   You don't always need the big place, the little place.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.760]   But things expand and contract.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.320]   I've joked, but it's not a joke.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.760]   I just haven't seen anybody able to do it.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.600]   My ideal way to live would be if somebody could figure out
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.560]   how to bolt together housing modules.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.720]   I would like to live in modular housing.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.880]   And I would like everybody to live in modular housing.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.720]   So picture this, you're young, you're single.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.640]   Well, why not have little modular houses?
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.200]   Let's picture a small shipping container,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.400]   not the big long Connex boxes, but the short,
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   the 20 foot, I think the 20 feet, not 40 feet.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.520]   Picture a 20 foot shipping container.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.440]   That's 200 square feet is everything
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.720]   that a single person needs.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.240]   And I could put in that little house,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   it could have a place to sleep and a place to live.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.240]   And you could put together a little commune of those
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.360]   with 20 or 30 or 40 of my friends.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.720]   Just we all have a little houses.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   And then we pick up and move.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.680]   So we just hook up that little housing unit
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.440]   and we move that housing module from one side of the state
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.680]   to another side of the state, from one city to another
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.920]   to take a job or to move something else out.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.600]   So then I go ahead and let's say that I marry
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.560]   and now I'm living with my wife.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.240]   And I go ahead and now let's bolt on,
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.080]   instead of having just a small little cooking module,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.080]   let's go ahead and bolt on a kitchen module.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.160]   And let's bolt on another bathroom module.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.280]   And then we have a baby.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.520]   So let's bolt on a second bedroom.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.160]   And then as your family grows,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.120]   you just bolt on a couple of additional bedrooms,
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.800]   a couple of additional bathroom modules.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.240]   And then as time grows, then you don't need them.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.880]   The kids move up, they grow up, they move out.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.000]   Well, you go ahead and unbolt that module from there
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.920]   and send them along with their own first housing module.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.040]   And instead of that bedroom module being connected
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.960]   to your big house, then that bedroom module goes with them.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.360]   They hook it up to the back of their truck
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.880]   and they drive it or you drive it for them
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.400]   across the state so they can go to college.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.640]   And they live in their housing module
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.520]   and the process continues.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.760]   Now, I don't know if anything like that
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   will ever be invented, probably not.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.960]   And it's not necessary that it be invented,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.000]   but I think a lot about that concept.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.080]   And I've come to embrace that idea of seasonality
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.200]   more than I ever did in the past.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.800]   I think there's value of recognizing
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.240]   that your needs are different.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.640]   And depending on the phase of life you're in,
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.200]   you can adjust the modules of your housing.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.120]   And it doesn't have to be one American housing dream.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.880]   It can look different at different phases of life.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:59.320]   So my plea for you is don't take any of these things
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.440]   that I've talked about in this series
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.840]   and think that one of them is perfect for you,
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.040]   but look critically at the circumstances around you
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.480]   and try to figure out if there's a way
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.000]   where you can mold those circumstances
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.480]   to help you hit your life goals
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.840]   more efficiently and more quickly
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.000]   so that you can indeed live that rich
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   and meaningful life now,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.360]   enjoying comfort, enjoying beauty of surroundings,
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.840]   enjoying a tranquil retreat,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.960]   enjoying a comfortable and secure place
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.680]   that keeps you secure from the elements,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.720]   secure from predators,
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.320]   so that you can enjoy those things now
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.000]   while also building your plan for financial freedom
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.400]   in 10 years or less.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.360]   And so that you can provide for your housing
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.640]   throughout your entire lifespan.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.720]   Hope these ideas have been helpful to you.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.800]   - Thank you for listening.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.160]   You've honored me with your time and attention,
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.240]   and I'm grateful for that.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.720]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.240]   with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.080]   and techniques and tools
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.640]   that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.560]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.560]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.600]   in today's show, make a plan to take action on it.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.680]   Listening does lead to learning,
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.280]   but learning in and of itself
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.600]   doesn't automatically lead to a life change.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.680]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.400]   So take action.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.440]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.800]   and share it with somebody that you care about.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.600]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.880]   in helping me to propagate the message
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.300]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.480]   That helps the person that you are engaging with.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.560]   And it also helps you because teaching others
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.520]   is one of the most effective ways for you to learn
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.240]   and for you to cement your learning.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.040]   Three, if there's an idea
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.960]   that's been specifically helpful to you,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.760]   and if you're gaining financial benefit
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.560]   from Radical Personal Finance,
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.760]   I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me

[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.600]   But if you're gaining financial benefit from this show,
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.560]   and if it's achieving financial results in your life,
