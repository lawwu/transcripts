[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   >> Being able to take a step back, detach, and see the bigger picture to me is the true
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.360]   superpower of life, of life, and it's a lot harder than it sounds.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.560]   And you know, this goes back to when you start talking about people that are having, going
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.820]   through struggles in life, right?
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.800]   And I've described this before as, you know, if I'm looking at you and you're in a bad
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540]   state, right, you're depressed, you're sad, you're moping around, you're not getting anything
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540]   done.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.520]   And I'm looking at you from the outside, and I'm thinking, for me, I see this storm cloud
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.560]   around your head, right?
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.560]   I see the storm cloud around your head, and you're in there.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.720]   And all you see, no matter what direction you look, is storm.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.520]   All you see is darkness.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.480]   I'm outside, and I'm looking, I'm like, "Hey, man, this guy's got a great education.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   He's healthy.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.040]   He's got a good team around him.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.760]   Like he's got all these things going for him."
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.960]   But you, in that state, you literally cannot see anything but the darkness of the storm.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   And that's what's so scary about when people enter that mode, is you can look, I can look
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.800]   at it from the outside and be like, "Andrew, you just got to move like four feet forward,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.720]   and you're going to be through this thing."
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.000]   And yet you might hear me say that, and you go, "No, Jocko, I'm looking ahead.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.100]   There's nothing but darkness."
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.320]   So helping people move forward, take action, and be able to get that perspective, detach,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.000]   and get outside themselves, get outside their own heads.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.240]   You know, Tim Ferriss said, "Get out of your head.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.240]   Get into your body."
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.520]   That's one way to do it.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   Take action.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   Go do things.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.560]   But it's very scary, and I'm sure you've had this experience where you're talking to someone
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.200]   that you know, and they're bogged down in whatever problem it is, whatever stress they're
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.480]   under, and you're looking at them going, "Hey, man, it's going to be okay."
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.520]   You can clearly see that whatever is bothering them and dragging them down, you can clearly
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   see...
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.880]   You know, a lot of times it's a relationship, right?
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.120]   The girl, the guy, they got dumped, and you go, "Hey, man, that person was a disaster
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   anyways.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   You're better off without them."
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.160]   And they cannot compute that.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.440]   They are stuck there.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.280]   Or maybe it's the school that they didn't get into, or the job that they didn't get,
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.840]   and they get so wrapped up in that, they can't get out of that storm.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:34.320]   And it's such a helpless feeling to sit there and tell someone, "Hey, you just move a little
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.640]   bit towards me, and you're going to get out of this storm."
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.760]   And it's so much easier said than done.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.280]   And that's why trying to engage with people and trying to give people that superpower
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   of detachment where they can take a step back and say, "You know what?
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   You're right, man.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.560]   That girl, she wasn't who I really thought she was.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   I should move on."
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.640]   Yes.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.200]   But easier said than done, and that's one of the biggest challenges I think that we
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:10.000]   have as friends and in parents and teammates is helping people learn to detach, learn to
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.720]   see the bigger picture, learn to see that the problem that you have that your whole
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.080]   world is actually not that big of a deal.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   You know what I wrote?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   I've written a bunch of kids' books, and one of the things that triggered me to write
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.240]   kids' books is realizing that, you know, one day my daughter came home.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.360]   It's my oldest daughter.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.480]   And she came home from school, and she's like, she says, "I'm stupid."
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   I said, "What do you mean you're stupid?"
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   She said, "I'm stupid.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   I'm dumb.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   Why do you think that?"
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.320]   You know, whatever grade it is when you're supposed to know your times tables.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.120]   "I don't know my times tables."
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.120]   I said, "Oh, well, how much have you studied?"
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.560]   And she kind of gave me the confused look.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.800]   "What do you mean studied?"
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.840]   I said, "Have you studied yet?
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.920]   Have you made flashcards to learn them?"
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.920]   And she didn't.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920]   She hadn't.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   She thought she should just know them.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.680]   From, you know, the teacher went over what they are, now she should know them like some
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.740]   other kids in the class did.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.360]   And so I'm sitting there going, "Oh, yeah, cool, we'll just, you know, we'll make some
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   flashcards."
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.940]   And she made flashcards, and she learned her times tables in 45 minutes, and we were good.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.360]   But what struck me was, to me, I was like, "Oh, no big deal."
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.780]   To her, it was her whole life.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.140]   And then I got to see that with my other kids.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.940]   You know, somebody said something to them in the recess yard, and I'm like, "Oh, screw
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.940]   that kid.
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.940]   They don't know what they're...
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.940]   Don't worry about them."
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.540]   But when you're...
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.360]   That's their whole world.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.100]   And that, unfortunately, doesn't only apply to kids.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.140]   It applies to adults as well.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:45.340]   And they get this problem in their world that seems so insurmountable and so massive because
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.120]   that little ecosystem that they're stuck in is their world.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.820]   And they run into this problem in that, and it's disruptive in that world, and they don't
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.820]   know how to get out of it.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.100]   You know, I did a podcast talking about these ecosystems that people get into, right?
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.100]   And there's all these ecosystems.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.500]   You're in an ecosystem.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.940]   We're both in a shared ecosystem of podcasting.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.820]   And we could be like, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.100]   You know, Lex just came out with a new podcast, and it's been the biggest success.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.500]   And what can I do to catch up with Lex?"
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.820]   And all of a sudden, I could get really...
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.820]   You could get really...
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.940]   We could be bothered by that and think, "Man, I'm a failure."
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.860]   Meanwhile, there's people that don't listen to podcasts.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.360]   There's people that don't even know what a podcast is, and yet it's our whole world if
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   we let it be.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.860]   You're in the academic world.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.660]   You go...
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.740]   You're a professor at Stanford, which is a big deal in that world.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.540]   I know people that don't give a rat's ass.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.540]   They couldn't...
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.740]   They don't know where Stanford is.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.740]   I get that all the time.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.740]   They don't know where Stanford is.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.740]   It's no big deal.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.100]   In the SEAL teams, same thing.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.520]   Somebody has a problem in the SEAL teams, and they think, "This is the whole world,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.460]   and I blew it."
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.940]   And now, what are they gonna do?
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.140]   When you're facing a significant problem in life, a relationship, a problem with a job,
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.500]   you gotta remember that you're in one ecosystem.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.220]   And if you step outside of that ecosystem, no one really cares.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.260]   And you could go move into a whole totally different ecosystem and find happiness there,
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.620]   but at least utilize that to get out of that storm cloud that you're in, and you're gonna
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.260]   find that there's plenty of light out there in the world.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.180]   Move towards that, and it's gonna be a much better situation.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:32.500]   Thank you.
