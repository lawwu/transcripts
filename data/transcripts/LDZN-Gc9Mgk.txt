[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.600]   - Carlos in Austin, Texas writes in,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.180]   "Dear Pastor John, Calvinists are usually
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.500]   "on the more intellectual spectrum of Christianity.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.980]   "Do Calvinists believe there is a role for demons
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.680]   "and dark spiritual forces in modern times?"
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.820]   - I won't speak for all Calvinists,
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.220]   though I am pretty sure that what I say
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.700]   will be representative of what Calvinists believe,
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.700]   even if we might put emphases in different places.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.340]   I would say that the, quote, intellectual bent,
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.040]   and I think he's right about that,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.180]   intellectual bent that leads many to become Calvinists
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.440]   is the bent to read the Bible with rigorous care
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.980]   and take all of it with blood earnest seriousness.
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.820]   That's what I take intellectual to mean.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.820]   It's not generally Calvinists who use their intellects
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.700]   to contradict hard things in the Bible.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.500]   Calvinists are more often the ones who use their intellects
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.980]   to see what is inescapably real in the Bible
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.220]   and teach it no matter who likes it or not.
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.540]   Calvinism in general cuts against the grain.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.380]   It teaches things that cut against the grain
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.540]   of a human inclination.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.980]   So it's not the Calvinists who throw away
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.780]   the biblical teachings because they are contrary
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.220]   to the spirit of the times.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.840]   So when Carlos asks, "Do Calvinists believe
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.000]   "that there is a role for demons
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.100]   "and dark spiritual forces in the modern world?"
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.940]   My answer is yes, because the Bible teaches
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.500]   that Satan and his demons are real
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.140]   and massively influential.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.140]   He is supernatural, and therefore he's stronger
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.020]   than any mere human power.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.020]   He is a monster in terrible ways.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.740]   He's the supernatural monster who orchestrates
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.580]   for example, the kidnapping and enslaving
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.740]   and thousand-fold drugging and selling and raping
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.180]   and killing of girls around the globe.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.220]   He's masterminded that kind of wickedness
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.500]   and evil and many others.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   In Revelation 12, nine, he's called the great dragon,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.100]   that ancient serpent who was called the devil
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.020]   and Satan, the deceiver of the world.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.020]   And the scope of the horror of that dragon-like being
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.340]   is hinted at with images.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.620]   He's not just a garden snake.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.780]   We just got back from Georgia,
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.900]   and there were snakes in Georgia,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.980]   and they're no big deal.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.980]   This dragon, it says, his tail sweeps down
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.520]   a third of the stars.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.900]   Now, what's the point of that image?
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.900]   He crouches at Bethlehem to devour the Son of God.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.020]   And failing that, it says in verse 17 of chapter 12,
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.860]   the dragon became furious and went off to make war
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.820]   on those who keep the commandments of God
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.260]   and hold the testimony of Jesus.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.600]   So this is the monster who sweeps down a third of the stars,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.940]   wants to eat the Son of God,
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.780]   and failing that, he wants to eat us.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.340]   And he's marauding through the world
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.900]   for those who bear the testimony of Jesus.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.740]   And the way he makes war is by delusion and murder.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.420]   He's a liar and a murderer.
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.900]   John 8, 44, "He was a murderer from the beginning
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.820]   "and does not stand in the truth
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.880]   "because there is no truth in him.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.100]   "When he lies, he speaks out of his own character,
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.740]   "for he's a liar and the father of lies."
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.100]   So he's a liar and he's a murderer.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.540]   Peter says he's a lion who goes around devouring,
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.980]   trying to devour Christians.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.660]   He's not local, he's not a tribal deity.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.900]   He's global.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.940]   I mean, his tale is sweeping down stars.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.380]   It says in 1 John 5,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.540]   "The whole world lies in the power of the evil one."
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.300]   That is absolutely stunning.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   The whole world lies under or in the evil one.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.420]   He was not bluffing when he said to Jesus,
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.900]   "To you, I will give all this authority and their glory,
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.380]   "for it has been delivered to me."
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.900]   This is why Jesus says he's the ruler of this world.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.460]   And Paul calls him the God of this world, 2 Corinthians 4, 4.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.720]   It's why this age is called the present evil age
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.420]   or the dominion of darkness.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.060]   The devil is destined for the lake of fire,
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.500]   along with the beast and the prophet
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.740]   and all those who follow them.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.500]   It says in Revelation 20, 10,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.100]   "The devil was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur,
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.480]   "where the beast and the false prophet were,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.180]   "and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.180]   But for now, this devil is on a long chain
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.020]   and loose in the world.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.500]   He's the God of this world
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.260]   and the whole world lies under him.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.420]   And so we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.620]   but against cosmic powers of this present darkness.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.120]   He is wreaking havoc in families and churches.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.660]   I mean, this is my answer to Carl.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.360]   He's wreaking havoc in families and churches
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.620]   and cultures and nations.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.620]   He's behind the bloody carnage of abortion,
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.740]   and he's behind the destructive insanity
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.260]   of so-called same-sex marriage.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260]   And he's behind the intractable racial,
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.700]   ethnic hatreds in the world.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.540]   He's behind the industrial and political structures
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.700]   of corruption that fatten the pockets of the rich
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.100]   and powerful with no concern for the poor and the weak.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.380]   He's behind the horrors of Islamic terrorism
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.080]   and the blows that they wreak against innocent people
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.340]   almost every day.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.880]   I've just been blown away recently
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.180]   by some suicidal bomber in Afghanistan or Iraq
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.920]   or Saudi Arabia, just blowing up innocent people.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   He's behind the kidnapping and enslaving of young girls
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.500]   in the trafficking industry.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.160]   And he's behind the multi-billion dollar porn industry
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   that rips souls to shreds and ruins families.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.040]   The carnage that Satan is causing
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   is literally indescribable, but he is a fool.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.080]   He brought Jesus to the cross through Judas,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.520]   and that was his suicide.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.320]   It was his undoing, because at the cross,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.520]   he was, Colossians 2:15, disarmed.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   He was disarmed in this sense.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.600]   All those who trust in Christ,
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.400]   he was stripped of his eternally, he only has one,
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.200]   his eternally lethal weapon,
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.960]   because the only thing that can condemn us
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.280]   in God's courtroom at the end of the age,
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.080]   the only thing, it's not green apparitions
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.120]   on the ceiling of our bedroom in a demonic attack.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.320]   That's not gonna condemn anybody.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.640]   We can laugh at that.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.080]   But what will condemn us is unforgiven sin.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.480]   That's the one thing Satan can use
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.220]   to destroy a person forever,
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.120]   the accusation that they have sin that is unforgiven.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.080]   But in Christ, there is no unforgiven sin.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.240]   Those who are in Christ through faith in Jesus
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.540]   have their sins, all of them, all of them forgiven.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.200]   And so Satan's accusations against Christians
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.680]   come to nothing.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.600]   Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.340]   Answer, nobody will be able to,
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.040]   because in Christ, he was disarmed.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   He was stripped of his one eternally lethal weapon,
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.160]   namely the accusation of unforgiven sin.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   So yes, Carlos, yes, Christians, including Calvinists,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.440]   have the happiest and the most horrible news in the world.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.240]   Outside of Christ, there is darkness and bondage and death,
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.600]   and behind it all, a monster of supernatural power,
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.200]   and you don't have a snowball's chance in hell
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.000]   of resisting him outside of Jesus.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.520]   But Christ has conquered him,
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.880]   and in Christ, there is light and freedom
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.920]   and life and joy forever.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.160]   Wow, that is strong and sobering.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.860]   Thank you, Carlos, for the question.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.240]   Thank you, Pastor John, for the response.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.800]   Well, it is time for us to break for the weekend,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.680]   and you can catch up on all the episodes from the week
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   at our landing page, and really,
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.320]   for everything you need to know about this podcast,

[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.320]   You can send John Piper a question,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   download the apps, all of that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.880]   And on Monday, we're gonna return to talk about forgiveness.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.160]   Jesus says if we don't forgive,
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.000]   we will not be forgiven by God.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.860]   The stakes are very high.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.400]   We'll see you on Monday on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.680]   (upbeat music)
