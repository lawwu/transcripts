[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   Now, at the time, Jason, we were trying to raise $150,000 at a $1.5 million post-money
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.240]   valuation.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.240]   So, for $150,000, you could have owned 10% of Airbnb.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.800]   And the majority of them didn't even reply to the email.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   I actually ended up publishing a bunch of the rejection emails, but many people said
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.040]   like, "This isn't a good idea."
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.540]   Many people said like, "Travel, we're not like excited about travel."
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.780]   I remember one investor said, "We love everything but you and your idea."
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.000]   In other words, I'm like, "Well, everything else is good."
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.440]   Unfortunately, I thought to myself, "Wait, what else is there?
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   There's me, there's the idea."
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.440]   The logo.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440]   I guess there's the name.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   They didn't like the name either.

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.400]   We've had all the legendary startup CEOs on This Week in Startups over the past decade.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.040]   Daniel from Spotify, Travis from Uber, Toby from Shopify, Brian from Coinbase, Tony from
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.440]   DoorDash, Melanie from Canva, Slootman from Snowflake.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.780]   But man, I have been wanting to interview the founders of Airbnb, which is just one
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.560]   of the great companies of all time, and certainly in the last two decades of startup companies.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.880]   And I've been able to have both founders now on the program.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.840]   We had Joe Jebbia on episode 1675, and today his co-founder and the CEO of Airbnb, Brian
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   Chesky, is with us.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840]   How are you doing, Brian?
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   Hey, good.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   Great to finally be on, Jason.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   Good to see you.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   Yes.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.920]   We've been trying to get this on for a while, and we finally did it.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.100]   Congrats on the great performance.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.100]   Thank you.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.660]   So, last quarter, things have been going great.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.680]   I think big picture, when you look back on the last decade of running this company, there
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.260]   were really two meaningful companies that came out of this last cycle.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.900]   After Facebook and Twitter, you had Airbnb and Uber.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.360]   And I'm curious, I know the Uber story, obviously, up close and personal, how that was accepted
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.420]   by the investment community and the hurdles they had to get over to want to be in that
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.420]   business.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.540]   Uber, famously, had a lot of resistance to the concept of Airbnb, and now massive consumer
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.540]   acceptance.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.700]   So, when you look back on your journey, everybody telling you, "This is crazy.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.360]   It's never going to work."
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.380]   And then everybody, when they see you, saying, "Oh my God, I love Airbnb."
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.380]   How do you reconcile that as an entrepreneur?
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.380]   We came up...
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.940]   Obviously, I know Joe told the founding story, but I'll tell a little bit of the...
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.980]   There's a founding story, and then, Jason, there's a story of all the rejection.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.320]   The first time we came up with the idea, it was October 2007.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.080]   It was for a design conference that was coming to San Francisco.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.820]   There was an after-party at the Fairmont Hotel.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.280]   We went to the Fairmont Hotel.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.260]   The first person I told about the idea, he looks at me with a straight face.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.260]   He said, "Brian?"
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.260]   I said, "Yes."
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.420]   He goes, "I hope that's not the only idea you're working on."
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.420]   That's what he said to me.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.620]   And this was like a design luminaire in our industry.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.780]   And that was kind of the general sentiment.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.140]   I remember in January, February 2008, Joe and I were living in San Francisco, it was
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.140]   an apartment.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.560]   And we had a roommate named Phil.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.780]   And Phil worked for this company called Justin.tv.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.180]   Justin.tv was a precursor to Twitch, and it was funded by this program called Y Combinator.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.260]   Now, I didn't know anything about Y Combinator.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.820]   I didn't know anything about Silicon Valley.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.380]   I didn't even know what angels were.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.660]   Somebody once told me there are these people called angels.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.860]   And I said, "Oh my God, this person believes in angels."
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.300]   So, I was really naive.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.460]   I didn't know anything about Silicon Valley.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.140]   I was a designer by training.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.540]   And Michael said, "I can introduce you to these angel investors."
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.660]   And so, Michael introduced us to 10 to 20 angel investors.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.860]   Now, at the time, Jason, we were trying to raise $150,000 at a $1.5 million post-money
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.860]   valuation.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.860]   So, for $150,000, you could have owned 10% of Airbnb.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.420]   And the majority of them didn't even reply to the email.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.940]   I actually ended up publishing a bunch of the rejection emails.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.660]   But many people said, "This isn't a good idea."
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.900]   Many people said, "Travel, we're not excited about travel."
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.540]   I remember one investor said, "We love everything but you and your idea."
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.820]   In other words, I'm like, "Well, everything else is good."
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.060]   So, I thought to myself, "Wait, what else is there?
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060]   There's me.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.060]   There's the idea."
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.060]   The logo.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.060]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060]   I guess there's the name, but they didn't like the name either.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.940]   And what they meant by they liked everything but us and the idea was, it was three founders,
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.740]   one software engineer, and two designers.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.700]   And they thought, "Well, you have too many designers in your founding team."
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.140]   People just associated designers as non-technical, and therefore, maybe not adding value.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.420]   And I always felt like Joe and I, our ability as being designers, was actually part of the
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.900]   secret sauce of Airbnb because it was not a pure technology problem.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.620]   And also, people said, "This is crazy.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.260]   Strangers never say they're strangers."
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.860]   So, basically, no investors will invest in this company.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.940]   Everyone rejects us.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.900]   It's now the fall 2008.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.640]   We had just provided housing for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.900]   You know, Barack Obama and John McCain were running for president.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.300]   The airbeds weren't working.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.460]   We were renting out airbeds.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.460]   They weren't selling.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.940]   So, we thought, "Let's go with breakfast.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.940]   We're airbed and breakfast."
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.580]   And so, Joe and I ended up creating this collectible breakfast cereal.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.360]   These boxes of Cheerios that we called Obama-Os, the breakfast of change.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.480]   And then we bought Cap'n Crunch.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.020]   And we read that John McCain was a captain of the Navy and we called it Cap'n McCain's,
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.520]   a maverick in every bite.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.300]   And it seemed kind of crazy.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.160]   We made these cereal boxes and we actually printed and like made $30,000 worth of cereal
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.780]   boxes that we sold.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.360]   And you know those baseball card binders that kids put, those binders that kids put?
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.620]   We used to put credit cards in them.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.460]   In other words, we funded this company with tens of thousands of dollars of credit card
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.460]   debt.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.380]   We used the cereal boxes to get us out of debt.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.740]   But now, it's like October 2008.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.940]   We've been working on this idea for like a year.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.900]   At some point, my mom said, "Are you a cereal company?"
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.400]   And technically, I think we were.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.460]   I didn't want to admit it.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.380]   I guess we were cereal entrepreneurs, but not the right kind of cereal entrepreneurs.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:54.540]   And I remember I was with, out of desperation, Joe and I went to dinner with Michael Seibel.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.460]   And Michael Seibel, he had co-founders Justin Kahn, Emmett Shear, and Kyle Voight.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.420]   Emmett runs Twitch, Kyle Voight runs Cruise.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.940]   And we went to like a Thai restaurant in San Francisco.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.100]   And it was like towards the end of the year.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.540]   And we're like brainstorming what to do.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.540]   We were kind of screwed.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.760]   We're like, everyone said no to us.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   We have no traction.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.820]   We're selling collectible breakfast cereal.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.060]   Everyone thinks this idea is no good.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.580]   No one wants to fund like two designers and an engineer.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.580]   What do we do?
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.820]   And then Justin says, "I have an idea.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.860]   Why don't you apply to Y Combinator?"
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.140]   And we're like, "But we already launched.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.900]   Why would we apply to Y Combinator?"
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.940]   And they're like, "Because you're dying.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.580]   You have no like growth."
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.820]   And so, we go on the Y Combinator website and we realize that the deadline was the night
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.820]   before.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.820]   In other words, it had just expired.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.340]   We couldn't wait for another batch.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.900]   Oh, by the way, Jason, the financial crisis you remember had just happened.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.900]   - Sure.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.220]   - One investor, I'm not going to lie, one investor told me, he said, "The economy is
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.900]   so bad, we won't even invest in good companies.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.020]   You think we're going to invest in air bed and breakfast and unproven concept people
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.020]   stand with each other?"
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.880]   Oh, and one other story is that Joe and I went to University Avenue.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.540]   We met an investor who I won't name.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.900]   He orders a strawberry smoothie.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.740]   He then sits down drinking the strawberry smoothie.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.740]   Never picked his head up.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.940]   In my first interaction with an investor, I'm like, "Maybe this is what they all do."
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.740]   He goes, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.780]   And then within 10 minutes, he like leaves and I thought like he had to park his car.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.140]   We haven't seen him since though.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.140]   - That's hilarious.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:31.300]   - So, at this point, at this point, we're like these bad news bears of Silicon Valley.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.860]   We were like rejects and Justin Conn, we're at dinner and they're like, "Oh my God, you're
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.380]   totally going to die now because like you can't get into Y Combinator."
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.980]   And then Justin Conn says, "I'm going to email Paul Graham."
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.020]   And he ends up emailing Paul Graham and he goes, "Is this deadline definitely, definitely
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.020]   over?"
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.940]   And Paul Graham says, "I will extend it to midnight tonight."
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.580]   It's like 9 p.m., okay?
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.580]   - Yeah.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.780]   - But they have to apply by midnight.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.340]   Now, Joe and I are in San Francisco.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.500]   We have a co-founder named Nate who's an engineer.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   He's in Boston.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.180]   Now, it's like midnight and Nate kind of doesn't sleep past, I think he went to bed.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.740]   So, I told Joe, I said, "Okay, we'll divide and conquer.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.300]   I will fill out the application and you will convince Nate, you're going to wake his ass
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.340]   up in Boston and convince him to do Y Combinator if we get in."
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.980]   So, he calls Nate, apparently, he goes, "Nate's in," I'm like, "Great."
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.380]   We fill out the application, we submit it.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.020]   Then a week later or whatever, we get an interview and then we tell Nate and I think Nate's like,
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.020]   "Wait, what?
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.020]   What did I agree to?
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.220]   I agreed to like move to San Francisco?"
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.460]   So, you know that movie "8 Mile" where like Eminem, he's like, "You got like one shot?"
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.460]   - Yeah.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.460]   - This was kind of it.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.460]   This is like our one shot, right?
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.460]   - Yeah.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.580]   - So, we like prepared for this interview like crazy and we were warned, this is going to
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.700]   be like a 15-minute interview and they're going to ask you four questions at the same
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.700]   time.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.700]   And you better know every answer.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.660]   And Justin and Michael and Emmitt said like, "Just know your numbers inside and out."
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.860]   So, we basically did like rehearsals.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.220]   We almost recreated like NYPD Blue or like we throw a phone book in each other's faces.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.220]   - Yeah.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.580]   - And we were just like, "We better get this sh*t right."
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.580]   So, we go to Y Combinator, we go to the interview, it's exactly what I expected.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.540]   It's Paul, it's Jessica, it's Trevor Brackwell and it's I think Robert Morris.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.220]   And they're all like basically, they all ask us questions at the same time.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.220]   Like all four of them.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.780]   And I was like totally bewildered.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.740]   And the first question Paul Graham asked me is, "People are actually doing this?"
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.020]   And I said, "Yes."
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.340]   His second question was, "What's wrong with them?"
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.940]   And the interview at that point went downhill from there.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.700]   He, midway through the interview, he basically tried to get us to create Stripe.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.380]   He's like, "You should create this like payments company or like an online bank or something."
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.700]   And we're like, "That seems like a really good idea."
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.700]   But like, we have an idea.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.100]   And we're about to leave the interview.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.980]   It doesn't seem like it's going well.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.460]   And Joe takes out a box of Obama O's and he hands it to Paul Graham.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.460]   And Paul Graham's like, looks like he just got a novelty gift.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.460]   He's like, "All right.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.460]   Thank you."
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.460]   - Yeah.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.460]   - And Joe goes, "What's the story?"
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.060]   He goes, "This is how we funded the company."
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.300]   And he goes, "What do you mean?"
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.500]   He said, "Well, we told him the story, how we like made the cereal boxes.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.060]   And then the way we sold the cereal boxes, we mailed them to reporters and they put them
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.120]   in their newsroom desk and everyone would buy them."
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.540]   And he said something like, "I guess if you can convince people to pay $40 for a $4 box
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.940]   of cereal, then maybe you can convince at least some people to stay in each other's
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.940]   homes."
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.140]   And he ended up admitting us to Y Combinator.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.580]   And I guess we've never looked back since.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.180]   I also want to give credit to Jessica, because I think Jessica thought, I remember Paul and
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.140]   Jessica said later, they thought we were like cockroaches.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.980]   And I think they mean it in a good way, that it was like an investment nuclear winter.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.220]   And in a nuclear holocaust, the only thing that survives are cockroaches.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.700]   And the only thing that would survive an investment nuclear winter would be the founders of Airbnb.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.460]   We said, "We won't die no matter what happens."
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.060]   And so they basically funded us because we seem Brazilian, unkillable.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.860]   And like, even if the fundraising market was dried up, we would just go on.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.340]   So it was definitely not a story to glory in the beginning.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.440]   And I like to remind founders of this, because then when we got product market fit three
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.420]   months later, we got funded by Sequoia.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.180]   And so in a three-month period, we went from like, kind of like this untouchable company
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.180]   to Sequoia.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.580]   And if you were a part of Sequoia, so you'll remember 2009, I would say it was like, it's
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.980]   I don't know, it's like going to like an Ivy League school or something.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.540]   But it meant something, it was a real seal of approval and it was crazy.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.180]   And you were anointed basically, if Sequoia invested in you, that was like, okay, seal
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.220]   of approval.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.720]   This is a legit company.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.740]   And I think it meant even more than not because Sequoia was more prestigious than but because
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.940]   there wasn't a much capital than like, I just, you know, I don't, you know, this industry
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.940]   better than I do.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.580]   But I don't remember hundreds of people I could contact to get money.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.860]   They're really angel list.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.860]   I don't think existed.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.980]   Or I just get it was venture list at the time.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.120]   I always do it like my open angel forum, they were like, maybe you could make a list of
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.580]   maybe 25 angel investors in the valley.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.020]   And half of them said no to us already.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:06.940]   So clearly, and we raise money, Jason, our first actual round, which is a series A was
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.900]   and this is when we had product market fit, we were voted by Y Combinator.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.420]   So each batch, they rate like the best company like halfway through and at the end, and we
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.420]   were rated the best.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.220]   We had the most traction.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:26.220]   And then then we raised $615,000 at a $3 million post money valuation, credible with product
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.820]   market fit $3 million post money.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   It's crazy.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.140]   And you just like look at the signaling at that time.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.140]   It's so weird.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.980]   Like people had these ideas like, oh, well, the only way it's going to work is if you're
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.700]   from Stanford, you're from RISD.
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.980]   Like what is that like?
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.980]   And one developer and two designers?
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.900]   makes a difference between two developers and one designer?
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.900]   Obviously, these are not the material things.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.400]   All that matters is the customers.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.140]   And do they engage with the product and actually get some value.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.740]   And that's what you figured out was, you don't need to appeal to everybody.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.340]   There just has to be somebody who gets value from this.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.340]   Exactly.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.340]   And there's a group of people.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.340]   That's a great lesson.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.780]   Michael Sabe used to tell us to me, I used to tell Jason, Michael, I said, my sister
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.820]   won't stay in Airbnb because initially, when I first came to the idea, she said she wouldn't
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.820]   do it.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.580]   And he said, you don't do cares about your sister.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.060]   She's not the early adopter.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.340]   You need the early adopters.
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.580]   You just need enough people to get the flywheel going.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.580]   Everyone else will come later.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.580]   So focus on those people.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.700]   And you think about his first hand experience with Justin TV was like, Justin TV was called
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.380]   Justin TV because there was one person who was insane enough to record their life.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.380]   Yes.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.380]   Exactly.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.380]   Yes.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.380]   Then it became Twitch.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.980]   And now here we are, there's 10 million people streaming and like you turn on TikTok and there
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.780]   are people who are working in China, like cooking and they're on a live streaming like
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.100]   what is happening in the world like people are making a living just live streaming themselves
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.620]   cooking in a restaurant halfway around the world.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.980]   And it really is about those early adopters.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.300]   Imagine this, you've got the greatest idea ever for a tech startup, and it's going to
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.540]   change the world.
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.320]   But you got a problem.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.100]   You don't have the engineers you need to make this a reality.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.100]   Why?
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.980]   It's hard to find engineers, right?
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.340]   Everybody's in competition for those great engineers.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.780]   And you've got to manage your burn rate, you don't have unlimited resources like those
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.360]   big slow incumbents, you've got to be efficient.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.300]   So now imagine you had a partner who could provide you with more than 1000 on demand
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.140]   engineers and these devs were vetted experience result oriented and passionate about helping
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.060]   you grow and they charge competitive rates sound too good to be true.

[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.800]   I was really impressed today and I've always been impressed with you and Joe and then the
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.840]   team of this like relentless focus on the customer experience.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.840]   Yes.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.960]   And now becoming a public company, growing at the pace you did having to deal with regulation
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.080]   and there's a lot of blocking and talking and tackling and operational stuff.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.800]   I'm curious how you spend your time today as CEO of the company.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.240]   Because in just over the last decade, every time I talked to you about Airbnb on Twitter,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.200]   or I mentioned Airbnb or something I like about it, you're instantly in there responding
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.620]   and thinking about product.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:47.320]   And so I'm curious, how much of your day are you on product over time?
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   How is that change?
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.040]   And how do you stay so focused on product versus doing your chores, which as a public
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.560]   company, there's a lot of chores that come up?
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.160]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:03.920]   I would say I spend almost all my time on product, marketing, and hiring, those three
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.920]   things.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.320]   And product and marketing, I also combine, like a lot of companies, they think of marketing
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.760]   as like advertising and product as product development.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.360]   We actually have a function, we took it from Apple, product marketing, where we tie, we
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.080]   basically try to make sure product and marketing are joint the hip.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.400]   Think of product as the chefs, marketers the waiters, and a lot of companies like the waiters
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.280]   can't go in the kitchen, they get yelled at.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.100]   So we really try to make them integrated.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.280]   So here's how we run the company.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.520]   The entire company is a functional organization.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.960]   So we have an engineering group, a product marketing group, a design group, like ops,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.340]   you know, legal, HR.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.400]   So most every other company is divisional or subdivisional.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.120]   The entire company is on one single roadmap.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.560]   So I mean, yeah, there's accounting systems that maybe aren't, but basically anything
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.160]   you ever see is on one roadmap.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.600]   Most companies have separate roadmaps.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.480]   And then we do these release cycles.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.760]   And we basically do a giant release in May and a giant release in November.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.140]   So basically, the idea is that we try to basically take the best of software development, and
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.740]   the best in hardware development, and put it onto one practice.
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.280]   And the reason why is I found that the way people develop software, which is great for
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.540]   10 people, where you basically democratize data, you decentralize, and anyone can ship
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.840]   anything and it feels very empowering, and it feels it can go really fast.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.340]   That's great until you're like 1000s of people.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.780]   And then everyone is basically a free for all.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.480]   They're all hitting the payments platform.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.280]   There's no cohesive roadmap.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.380]   As you subdivide the company, ideas get smaller, you don't even know what to market.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.900]   And then you can't keep track of everything, then there's like no accountability.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   And so and then lack of accountability becomes politics and bureaucracy, all this weird stuff.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.740]   So when the pandemic occurred, out of basically Jason's survival, we lost 80% of our business
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.240]   in eight weeks.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.380]   And Joe and I and Nate, we were like, what the hell do we do?
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.060]   And we were like staring into the abyss.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.300]   I mean, you might remember people were making predictions like is this the end of Airbnb?
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.020]   Will Airbnb exist?
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.540]   And one of the people I was talking to a lot back then was Johnny Ive.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.540]   He now works with me.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.920]   But he told me the stories of Steve Jobs going back to Apple.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.120]   And when Steve Jobs went back to Apple, you know, they were like 90 days from bankruptcy.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.760]   And I'm like, well, that seems kind of like, you know, Airbnb is in a very precarious situation.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.620]   And Johnny Ive said, you know, you can cut but you can't cut your way to the growth.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.680]   Steve, you have to build product, you need to stay in the product.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   And I hired a guy named Hiroki Asai from Apple, he was also instrumental.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.760]   And so I totally changed how I ran the company.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.860]   So what I used to do is I was very hands off, I democratize data, I was very much reactive,
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.600]   I thought my job was like strategy and capital allocation.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.480]   And here's the weird thing, the less hands on I was, the more I got sucked into problems.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.160]   And when I by the time I got sucked into a problem, it was like 10 times as much work.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.560]   So then I decided I'm going to do something different.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.160]   We're going to be totally integrated, one roadmap, I'm going to do very few things,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.600]   and I'm going to be involved in every single detail.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.560]   And Airbnb is not going to do anything more than I can personally focus on.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.940]   And that what became the governor.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.400]   And this is what Steve said at Apple, he said, well, we want to do more things than I can
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   focus on.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   Now, this sounds like it would slow us down.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.520]   And initially, it did slow us down.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.960]   Because I would review everything.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.440]   So I had these things called CEO reviews.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.640]   And every single project in the company, I had a program management function.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.760]   And I would review everything either every week, every two weeks, every four weeks or
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.800]   every quarter.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.720]   And then we track the progress.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   And then you know, then everything would ship on a single deadline.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.880]   Initially, people hated this, no one wanted to collaborate, people didn't want to have
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.480]   imposed deadlines on them.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.320]   They were wondering, why are you meddling?
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.400]   Like, why are you reviewing all the work, but eventually, it created a culture.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.240]   And I was trying to teach a sense of quality, I was trying to be like the editor or the
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.680]   orchestra conductor.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.520]   And eventually, what ended up happening was, we were able to like start shipping faster.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.840]   And in the last three years, we've shipped 340 upgrades and innovations.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   And we obsess.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.760]   I mean, a lot of companies, they're just trying to grow.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.640]   And they look at their dashboard, they have these sub teams looking at growth, they're
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.320]   doing A/B tests.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.680]   And I don't like that process, the process of just chasing growth.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.860]   Because first of all, you're not really solving customer problems.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.320]   And if you're over reliant on A/B testing, and you choose B, do you know why B worked?
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.000]   Because if you don't know why B worked, you're stuck with B. And you can never redesign B
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.720]   because you don't even know why B was better than A. And so, we decided, if you're going
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.520]   to do ERF experimentation, you better know why B worked better than A. We're going to
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.760]   be qualitative and quantitatively driven.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.120]   And so, what I do is, I spend most of my time just reviewing work and hiring people.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.880]   So, I review all these different things.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.160]   And I don't really spend a lot of time on corporate matters anymore.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:40.840]   And the reason why is because once we designed the company, like, it became very efficient.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.120]   We also don't have a lot of employees.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.520]   We have like 5,300 employees.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.560]   And we did three and a half billion dollars in free cash flow last year.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.040]   So, you can just think about that.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   - That's incredible.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   - For every dollar, we do 40, 42% of 42 cents in free cash flow, which I believe is higher
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   than Google or Apple.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.680]   Now, obviously, we're not nearly as profitable at absolute dollars, but it's very efficient.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.040]   So, we try to be like the Navy SEALs around the Navy.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.440]   It's a small, lean, elite group.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.680]   It's super intense.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.720]   It's kind of day and night, to be honest.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.000]   But I'm honest about it.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.120]   And when people come to join, I probably try to talk people out of joining more talking
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   them in.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120]   I'm kind of like, "Are you crazy?
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.880]   Like, why do you want to put up with all this?"
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.240]   And it really tries to set a mindset that when you come here, this is a really intense
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.800]   place, but hopefully, it's going to be really gratifying.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.360]   And we're really connected, the top 30, 40 people in the company.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.720]   And I think of it as like one shared consciousness.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   Does that make sense?
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   - Yeah.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.280]   - So, it's one shared consciousness.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.000]   I don't push decision-making down.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.160]   I pull it in.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.960]   I don't make the decisions on my own.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:48.000]   There's like a group of us, a concentric circle that like kind of just are in constant conversation.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.120]   I don't do strategy reviews.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.520]   I do this thing called living with the strategy.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.600]   Instead of doing like a three-hour, that's like what boards do.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.240]   They get like a deep dive.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.600]   I talk about it every week until we resolve it.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.960]   So, every week, we'll have like, "What are we going to do about this topic?
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.160]   What are we going to do about this topic?"
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.400]   Until the answer reveals itself.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.760]   And I think this way of working is trial and error.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.880]   I've tried all the other ways of working and they didn't work.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.080]   And I think this like bottoms up, like giving tons of people a lot of discretion.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.480]   It does work when you're small.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.000]   When you get big, it becomes a free-for-all.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.080]   And I think a lot of big companies are paying the price.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.080]   - Yeah.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.440]   And the prioritization gets lost.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.840]   What I like about, "Hey, here's what I can keep in my brain," well, that also parallels
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.640]   what a customer can keep in their brain.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.640]   - Exactly.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.720]   - They can only handle so many new features at a certain velocity.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.200]   And if you give them 20 things, they're going to remember two.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   - Exactly.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   - And probably not more than that.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   - And that's what happened.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Years ago, we had, so we have one marketing department now, and they only market a few
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   things a year.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   And the things we market, you probably know about because we try not to say anything you
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   don't know about.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.240]   - Upfront and clear pricing was the last one.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   - Exactly.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.280]   And today, we promoted Airbnb rooms, and we promoted that there are a whole bunch of things
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.640]   people are angry about, or they don't like about Airbnb, and we've made 50 fixes.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.800]   And so we did that.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.880]   But I remember-
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.440]   - And before that was Experiences.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   - Yep.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   Experiences.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   We launched Airbnb Categories a year ago.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.440]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.440]   I remember that too.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.240]   - And Air Cover, which is this really important thing for hosts and protects them.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.440]   But years ago, at one point, we had 10 divisions.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.200]   We had 10 marketing departments.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.280]   And it was so crazy that one time, I asked the marketing department, "Get a conference
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.480]   room and put every piece of marketing on the wall."
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.760]   It took them a week to track down all the marketing because it was 10 different teams.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.240]   I'm like, "If you can't track down everything we're saying," and then I went around the
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.600]   wall and I said, "It feels like I'm looking at 10 different companies."
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.640]   And I didn't even know 80% of the marketing we were doing.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.360]   I mean, we were doing, we had different creative agencies in different countries, and it was
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.560]   just incoherent.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.800]   So what we do now is we just do a few campaigns.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.280]   We don't do local campaigns.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.040]   We trans-create, but we only do global campaigns because it's a cross-border business.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.920]   And we just try to be incredibly simple.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.440]   Steve Jobs had a saying, "Marketing is education.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.200]   You speak to the customer the way you talk to an eight-year-old."
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.520]   Not down to them, but they're busy.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.960]   You have to explain things simply.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.920]   If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.760]   And so every type of communication we try to do, we try to do to somebody who's not
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.720]   really paying attention, they're busy, and they don't have time and say, "What's the
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.040]   most basic idea we can communicate?"
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.440]   There is nothing like a great whiteboarding session, right?
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   Do you feel me?
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.680]   Well, now you can brainstorm ideas, collaborate on projects, and do more from anywhere in
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.120]   the world with Miro.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.640]   Miro is an incredible tool for taking your idea from inside your head and putting it
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.160]   out there in the real world.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.160]   Think zero to one.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.040]   Building a startup from scratch, it needs input from everybody on your team, and Miro
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.920]   democratizes collaboration and input.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.740]   And it's so much more than just a simple digital whiteboard.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.960]   It's a visual collaboration tool that's asynchronous and powerful.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.840]   Your team can collaborate on planning, research, brainstorming, designing, and feedback cycles.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.160]   Miro equals zero to one, but faster.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.200]   And here's the best part.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.600]   Miro has a community of power users building thousands of world-class templates over at
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.000]   Miro.com/Miroverse.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.160]   One of these templates that you're going to love is the Complete Naming Mega Workshop.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.680]   So many startups struggle with picking a great name in the early days of their startup.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.160]   Well, this board takes you through a thought experiment to figure out a name for your startup.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.960]   And remember, faster inputs equal faster outcomes, and velocity is how startups win.

[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:47.560]   It really is like this modern conundrum that Google finds itself in, not to single out
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   Google.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   I mean, any big company has this.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.680]   And I think Doug had it as well, which is, it's just too many people working on too many
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   different projects.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.200]   There's no cohesiveness.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.640]   And then quality goes down.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.200]   And then the consumers are like, am I supposed to buy a Pixel or some other Android phone?
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.520]   Am I supposed to use Chrome operating system or the Android operating system?
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.840]   Which one is going to win out here?
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.760]   And then I'm a consumer, I have a Nest, and then I have Google Home.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.960]   And just that one cognitive dissonance I have, like where I open up Google Home to see all
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.920]   of my cameras, and I open up Nest to see the old cameras.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.800]   And I like my Nest better, and it's just chaos, right?
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.880]   And Sundar's got to be in the middle of this, trying to referee it, and if he did the same
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.880]   approach.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   And I don't want that life.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   I had that life before the pandemic.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.960]   And I said, I don't want that life.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.480]   I don't want the life where I have to ask permission to get involved.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.320]   I'm adjudicating disagreements, I'm managing bureaucracy and dysfunction.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.840]   I want to be in the product with people making the product.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.240]   I want to be talking to customers, I want to be communicating with them.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.200]   And I want as little bureaucracy as possible.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.720]   And that requires us to do as little as possible.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.320]   There's an old saying, have few details and perfect every detail.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.760]   And that requires focus, it requires you saying no.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.600]   So, we probably say no now more than we say yes to things.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.280]   And I think that's pretty important.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.600]   - Yeah, the second business line really was experiences, am I correct?
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   - Yes.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   - It was stays and then experiences.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   - Yes.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.920]   - And is there even a third business line?
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   - No, no.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.040]   It's really just, you know, probably broadly like there's stays, 80% of stays are short-term,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.400]   20% are long-term stays defined by longer than 30 days.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.440]   So, that's kind of like an in-between, it's an extension of the core.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.840]   And then experiences, which has been kind of like in an in-between zone because it was,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.440]   we thought it was going to break out before the pandemic and then we had actually shut
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.800]   it down or pause it.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:40.560]   So, it's, we're in a process of we're going to reboot that and we do, and just to be clear,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.360]   we have some big ideas coming.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.560]   We have some really huge ideas that I think will expand Airbnb way beyond travel, way
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.040]   beyond our core.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.600]   It's going to launch next year.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.920]   But I'll tell one more story, you know, I feel like companies, you know, like there's
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.200]   certain companies you like root for them, like a lot of people love their Tesla car
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   and they like want Tesla to come out with a truck.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.920]   A lot of people love, in 2006, how many people wanted Apple to come out of the phone?
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   A lot.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.200]   And the reason why is we all loved our iPod.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.040]   How many of us love, wanted Gateway to come out with a phone?
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   Probably not many.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.440]   And so, I like to tell people, we have to have permission by the customer to do something
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   new.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.120]   And we only have permission to do something new if they love what we currently do.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.720]   And if they're complaining on Twitter about upfront pricing, about having to do chores
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.840]   and they check out, about customer service taking too long, then we don't have permission.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.800]   They don't want to do something new because they're going to think we're going to bring
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   problems to that category.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.520]   So, I told the team, I said, "We have some big ideas, AI is going to unlock so many of
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.800]   them, but we don't have permission to do new things until people love our core service.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.480]   So, we're going to basically create a blueprint of every single thing people are complaining
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   about."
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.760]   So, we created this storyboard of the end-to-end experience.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:56.960]   Then I got basically blueprinted out with the team, all 150 screens on the app, every
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.640]   user policy, all 72 user policies.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.240]   Now, each of these user policies are as many as 100 pages long, right?
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.200]   Like who gets a refund, when.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.080]   And imagine, Jason, you're a call center worker, Airbnb just hired you.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:15.280]   Now, like two customers in different languages are in a dispute and you're adjudicating between
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.840]   70 policies that are as many as 100 pages long.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.040]   That's a perfect example of AI.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.480]   Anyway, this is an opportunity where we realized, okay, we created this blueprint and then we
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:30.000]   mapped tens of thousands of social media posts, millions of customer calls, and all these
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   interviews with customers.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.240]   And we put them on the blueprint.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.400]   We looked at what is everyone upset about?
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.880]   What do they want fixed?
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.080]   And based on this blueprint, we were able to go stage by stage in the end-to-end journey
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.080]   and prioritize the top issues.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.720]   And we said, "We're going to get through every one of these issues before we do something
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   new."
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.840]   And that was the whole premise of today.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.240]   It was basically fixing what people wanted.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.640]   And then we had one more thing.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.880]   We're like, "We got some unfinished business."
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.120]   This idea of people staying with each other in their homes, the original idea of Airbnb,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.560]   that's kind of like the Volkswagen's Beetle or Nike's running shoes or Apple's iMac or
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.520]   whatever, the original car, original product.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.840]   I said, "We got to revive that.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   We can't.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.840]   We got to get back on the highway and we got to reinvest in this core idea before we do
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.840]   new stuff."
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.760]   And so, that was kind of what today was about.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.880]   And hopefully, if we're successful, people feel like we listened.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:28.680]   Let's talk about the user complaints and prioritization of them because how do you know when you're
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:34.280]   running something at scale like this, that this is something that's annoying but necessary.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.320]   You can't throw a party in an Airbnb.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.360]   I had my old home, which I was thinking of keeping, and I had an Airbnb.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.640]   And only one time in a year was there a party thrown there.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.920]   You guys handled it great.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   There was a little bit of damage.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.040]   Insurance picked it up.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.000]   But over and over again, it has in the documentation, do not throw a party here.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Do not throw a party.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   You can't throw parties.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.400]   So, how do you know when something is like, you know, just this is a deal breaker for
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.120]   people who are hosts.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:11.480]   This is a deal breaker for people who are going to choose a hotel or an Airbnb to run
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.600]   an Airbnb or not run an Airbnb as a host.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.720]   And these are like minor annoyances, but they come up frequently.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.600]   So, there's like a certain amount of suffering in each thing, right?
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.920]   And I'm curious how you prioritize the suffering to alleviate it, because you're also mitigating
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.040]   and arbitrating between these two groups of people, the hosts who can't be burdened so
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.520]   much that they don't want to be a host because it's arduous.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.200]   And then the people who are leaving the home who don't want to have to do an hour of chores
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   when they leave.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.000]   Like, it's reasonable to put the dishes in the sink, but do you have to mop the floor
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   or take out the garbage?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.280]   Okay, maybe taking the garbage out is okay.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.040]   How did you prioritize that?
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.480]   It's both an art and a science.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   I think that analyzing it is a science and then prioritization is probably more of an
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.480]   art.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   I can explain.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.240]   So, let's start with analyzing.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.320]   The first thing we do is we try to just take all the inputs.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.520]   So, what are the inputs we get?
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.640]   Inputs are customer service calls.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.680]   Inputs are social media posts.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.480]   Inputs are we do like tens of thousands of like, we do listening sessions with guests
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480]   and hosts.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.700]   And then inputs are like basically user behavior, right?
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.640]   You can like see what people are clicking.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.720]   You can see retention.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.640]   You can see when somebody churns.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.600]   And then if there's a party, we don't handle it right, they churn, they don't come back.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.760]   And then we see people in their network don't list and you can start to measure that.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.520]   So, those are your inputs.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.960]   Those inputs, you basically now have like an organization of like maybe millions of
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.240]   issues and you can bucket them to like say 100, 200 types of things.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.920]   The next thing you do is you look at the frequency and the severity.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.080]   So, severity might be like a safety issue.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.840]   Very infrequent, but when it happens, it's really serious.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.000]   A frequent issue is like, I'm upset with a refund.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.200]   Not as severe, but very frequent.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.840]   That happens all the time.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.760]   And then you start to look at relationships like, you know, we notice a lot of hosts are
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.040]   complaining about pricing being confusing.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.080]   A lot of guests are complaining that hosts are charging too high fees.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.920]   And then we start to realize, wait a second, if we make it easier for hosts to price and
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   they understand what guests are actually paying, they might actually do a better job pricing
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.600]   and guests won't complain as much.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.800]   So, you start to find like connections.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.280]   So, this is where, that's the science part.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.160]   Now the art part.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.040]   Now it's actually picking stuff because you have a list.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.400]   You have some matrix like severity, frequency, this and that.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:42.200]   But the real ability is the art form of a group of us, 10 or 20 of us, deeply understand
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.720]   the issue so well.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:49.280]   We live the product, we use the product, I host, I've read thousands of things.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.920]   You just take thousands of inputs, you put them in your head, and then you just go through
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.000]   and you can't paint by numbers.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.720]   You can't be purely algorithmic is what I would say.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.880]   That's why that's the art.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.120]   You could, but I think it's never as good as your intuition.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.880]   But your intuition is formed of all these data points.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.920]   And the intuition might be like, you know, it also might involve like engineering capability.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.280]   Like this is going to be a really heavy lift, so we have like t-shirt sizes.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.360]   A small lift, medium lift, large lift, extra large lift.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.560]   So, we'll prioritize high severity, high frequency, like low engineering lifts, for example, would
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   be a great candidate.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.560]   - Quick wins.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.560]   - Quick wins.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.560]   - Yeah.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   - That with high payoff.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.000]   There might be a big lift, but we need to do it to launch this feature later.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   So basically, there's like hundreds of inputs.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.480]   You see how like you're like weighing all these in your head?
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.960]   And I think there is this, I think developing a product, the best products I feel like are
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.200]   a group of people that are deeply involved and they can hold a thousand contradictory
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.600]   things in their head.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.040]   And they can make all those different trade-offs.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.080]   We call that intuition, but I don't know if I love that because it makes it seem like
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.560]   it's arbitrary and not systematic.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.040]   It actually is very deep and it can actually be very technical.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   And so, that's what we do.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   I audit all the prioritization and I personally decide on the final prioritization of every
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.720]   single project and the company that a customer will ever see.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.360]   I don't decide, I mean, the final decision, I make the final call.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.880]   And I only make a call if I'm informed.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.720]   And I only am informed if my team understands.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.840]   And so, I make sure that I know the details, my directs know the details, and their directs
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   directs know the details.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.040]   I also have a rule that if I have a direct report in a meeting, they can never call their
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.800]   direct to answer a question.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.600]   If that's the case, they don't know the details and their scope is too big.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.120]   So I mean, within reason.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.520]   So that's kind of how I do it.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.600]   And then we update it twice a year.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.840]   So we have this thing called the Roadmap Review where we bring in like top 70 or so product
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.200]   people in the company or people weighing on the roadmap.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.920]   We spend a couple days together.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.840]   We debate everything on the roadmap, we adjust it, and then we roll it out.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.560]   And then we have an extremely robust program management function.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.520]   Most companies ask product management to basically be their program managers.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.480]   We separate product management with program management.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.920]   And we have a very small product management function.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.080]   It's very small.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   We have product marketers.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.200]   Product marketers are senior product managers.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.100]   So we have no outbound people.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.960]   You have to know inbound and outbound.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.480]   The junior product managers don't need to do outbound.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.200]   But then most of what people call product management, we call program management.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.840]   And they're the ones keeping the whole thing on trains because everything has to fit together.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.880]   And they're doing like really rigorous reporting every week about like where we are at the
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   project.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   So it's all integrated.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.800]   And the net result of this, Jason, is I can literally know the performance of an individual
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.760]   engineer I've never met on a week-to-week basis.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.280]   Because imagine if we're all designing a car, I know how good the tire team is doing when
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.960]   I see the car assembled every week.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.040]   And I see, hey, there's something wrong with the tire.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.160]   But when there are like 100 different products, I don't have time to value 100 different things.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.280]   I mean, this is where constraint comes in.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.520]   If you want to make great art, as you learned as an artist at RISD, like if you give some
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.760]   artist a thousand canvases and buckets and buckets of paint and a million brushes, like
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.760]   where do you begin?
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.760]   Right?
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   And how do you prioritize?
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.480]   And you just get lost.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.880]   Creative people want constraints.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   And that's the other thing.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.160]   And I think what happened, and maybe this is a burger lesson, Jason, in Silicon Valley
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.080]   is I think in the last 10 years, we as entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley probably didn't have enough
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   constraints.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.120]   And it's kind of like we didn't ask for constraints, we didn't want constraints, but we probably
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   needed them.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.760]   I think that Airbnb before the pandemic probably raised too much money.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.680]   And we didn't raise as much money as others.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.600]   And I think that in hindsight, like not having as much money means you have constraints.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.320]   Constraints means you have to say no, you have to make hard decisions.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.440]   If somebody is not performing, you can't just hire more people, you got to deal with it.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.760]   And if a product's not succeeding, you got to actually fix it or sunset it, you know.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.000]   So I think the constraints are really critical.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Listen, we work with super early stage companies at my investment firm launch, you know, pre
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.760]   Series A, maybe got a couple of $1,000 a month in revenue, you've raised a couple $100,000,
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   maybe $1 million, right?
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.100]   That's the early days, year one or two of a startup.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.120]   And I'll be honest, a lot of times startups, they don't have their insurance.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.280]   They haven't set that up yet.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.320]   They haven't set up their accounting properly.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   They're getting things cleaned up.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:24.040]   In fact, I was recently had a great startup, but they didn't have DNO insurance that basically
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.080]   protect your directors and officers.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.640]   That's the D directors, people on the board, officers, the people who work at the company,
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   right?
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.440]   directors and officers insurance is super important.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.440]   So what do we do?
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.340]   We sent them right to in broker or friends over to broker or a business insurance company
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.720]   that's built specifically for startups.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.880]   You just fill out a simple application, right?
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.960]   And then startups get four quotes for four lines of coverage in 15 minutes, four quotes,
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.760]   four lines of coverage, 15 minutes, easy breezy lemon, squeezy.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   That's right.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.200]   They connect you with one of their expert brokers for unmatched service that goes beyond
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   your policy.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.560]   And listen, you might think, oh, it's too early to have insurance.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.720]   It's not that expensive.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.640]   It's not that complicated, because in broker makes it easy.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.120]   So here's what I want you to do.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.320]   Try and broker today with the code twist, and you'll get 10% off their startup package
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.520]   at in broker.com/twist.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.040]   That's in broker.com/twist.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040]   We love in broker.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   I use in broker.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   It's an amazing team.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.720]   They do a great job for startups, whether you're in year one or year five, go use in
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.720]   broker.com/twist.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:35.200]   The zero interest rate policy led to a lack of discipline and maybe you avoid difficult
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   decisions.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.400]   Like, hey, this divisions working out okay, but it's not great.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.480]   Yeah, it's never gonna be profitable.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.680]   And you watched Uber, you know, you guys had your media stuff you were doing for a little
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:50.120]   while, which you were passionate about, I remember, but like, at a certain point, it's
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.480]   about the guests.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.600]   It's about their experience, and how many different projects could Uber do?
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.080]   They were doing micro mobility.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.800]   And that was interesting, but it was just such a minor, unprofitable piece of the business.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   They deprecated it, right?
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.740]   People really want to get on scooters, like what percentage of people in what percentage
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.740]   of cities?
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:11.880]   When you did this cycle, what do you think are the problems you solved that were the
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.240]   most rewarding for you?
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.380]   Because when you solve a problem, you immediately know.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.760]   So when you say cycle, you mean which time horizon?
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.880]   Well, the one you just did, where today at the release, there must be things that you
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.320]   personally, as you did the prioritization said, hey, these three things, these are the
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.360]   big wins.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.720]   And now you put that tweet storm out with the images in it showing each one, which I
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.680]   love by the way, when you get it directly from the founder, and it's like, here's the
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.320]   image, here's what I was thinking.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.680]   Let me know.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.040]   How did the public's early response, your host's early response, your customer's early
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:51.440]   response to what you thought the top three things were versus what they think the three
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.720]   things are?
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:59.440]   Yeah, so the things I prioritized was probably number one, anything around pricing.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.400]   The number one complaint at Airbnb is that the prices have gone up.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:07.280]   And we started as an affordable alternative to a hotel, and Airbnbs had become over time
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   less affordable.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.120]   And I think we just like, I mean, that in itself was a potentially zero interest rate
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.520]   kind of phenomenon.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.320]   And so, that was the number one, it was like pricing transparency.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.400]   The second one I focused on, because I just was so tired of hearing about it and I didn't
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.920]   want people to deal with it, was checkout chores.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.200]   There was this, you know, turn the lights off and you'll leave is totally reasonable.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.680]   Strip the bed and put the sheets in the laundry is not reasonable, you're on vacation, like,
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.880]   and especially if you pay the cleaning fee.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.200]   So, that is not reasonable.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.840]   So, that was the second one that I really prioritized.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.880]   The third, and this is more on the opportunity, is monthly stays.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.440]   That's a growing part of our business.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.240]   People think of us as a travel company, but 20% of our business is now housing.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.160]   And Airbnb, there's a lot of problems with monthly stays.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.140]   For example, you can only pay by credit card.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.440]   Paying your rent with credit card means you have to pay a credit card processing fee.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.040]   So, we thought, well, what if we allowed an integration where you can pay by bank?
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   We did integration with Stripe, and now you can save a bunch of money paying by bank.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.000]   You can now pay in installments.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.520]   We now lower the fees.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.520]   We now have this really cool little dial.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.240]   We now have really cool pricing discount tools.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.400]   So, hosts can be encouraged to charge less and will promote the very best listings.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.320]   So, these are maybe some of the ones that I was probably most passionate about.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.560]   Anything around pricing, anything around chores, anything around really expanding the definition
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   of Airbnb.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.360]   But yeah, there were 53 upgrades that we made.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   So, there were a lot of things.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   That's incredible.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.640]   And running a remote company, you're so thoughtful about how you're running the company now,
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   and then you have constraints.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.920]   It seems like you've got it really dialed in.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.360]   And listen, the stock market is responding to it.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.400]   The stock market is looking for discipline.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.320]   I think you were the first of the cohort to actually show it.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   Uber just showed it.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.080]   They started hitting free cash flow.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.560]   Dara's done a great job there.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.680]   And we're starting to see this discipline.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.200]   And Zuck actually got religion.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.640]   He cut 20,000 people and got rid of layers of management.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:04.200]   How is, when you are a remote company and you try to institute this, are these things
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.320]   in sync still?
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.240]   Or do you miss being in the same place with each other?
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:14.840]   Or do these retreats that you're doing and these offsites, whatever you call them now,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   are they enough?
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.560]   Or do you think at some point you want to be in an HQ again?
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   Actually, yeah.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.920]   So, probably, actually even good to clarify, we're not a so-called returned office company
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   or a remote company.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.760]   I would say Shopify and Coinbase are probably remote companies, as far as I can tell, last
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   I checked.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.480]   I go to an office every week.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.720]   And many of my top people go to an office every week.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.800]   And we have offices open, and we welcome people back to the office.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.240]   But we don't require people.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.800]   We say, "You work wherever the hell you want because we're so disciplined, so organized
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.320]   that we don't think there's going to be a hit to productivity."
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.120]   I basically came to the conclusion that, especially with the accelerating rate of technological
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.160]   progress to AI, increasingly, you're going to be able to have more and more of a global
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.280]   talent pool.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.720]   And so then, if you're going to require people to come into an office, you have to believe
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:03.000]   that you get a greater productivity gain by having them physically there than the productivity
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.760]   gain you have being able to hire anyone anywhere in the world.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.000]   And for some jobs, like your core team, where it's really creative and you're making stuff,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.240]   I think you want to be physically together.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.720]   But I do not need our accounting systems to be managed together physically around me.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.920]   I don't need thousands of people physically around me.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.120]   I can't even talk to them.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:26.440]   After about 1,500 people, I can't remember the conversations.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.080]   I can't keep track of those conversations.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:34.440]   So my vision is that we have a small, tight team of some of the most senior people, many
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   product people.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.920]   We built this creative studio, and we're in San Francisco a lot.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.840]   And then the rest of the company, they can choose.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.020]   Some groups, they do come to the office.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.160]   Other groups, people just work totally remotely.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.760]   And then once a week, a quarter, we try to bring people together.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.800]   Sometimes it might be a week every six months.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.360]   And I think that kind of suffices for a lot of people.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.160]   In other words, we kind of give teams the option.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.320]   But the most senior people, we're pretty much together.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.000]   We also travel a lot together.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.840]   So I'm here in New York.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.680]   We probably had 20 people here with me.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.440]   So I was around them.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.920]   But I think we're just still learning.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   We're still moving.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.640]   And I think, Jason, the future is flexibility.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.840]   I think that this is the worst technology we'll ever be in our lifetime.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.360]   As screens get better, as bandwidth gets stronger, I think people are going to want more flexibility.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.720]   And my prediction is even proponents of working in the office, I bet you a lot of those people
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.240]   are going to be somewhere else over the summer in an Airbnb.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.240]   You know?
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.560]   It's easy for people to be like, "Yeah, we will."
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.160]   All these rich guys in New York, let's just be honest, all these rich guys in New York
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.720]   who said they want to call back to the office, they're all going to Hamptons for the summer,
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.240]   and they're going to Europe in August.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   So even the return to office, those aren't 12 months a year.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.680]   Those are now nine months a year.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:48.240]   And I mean, Europeans have a better lifestyle and they enjoy it.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.040]   So maybe what happened during this pandemic, when we look back on and we do the post-mortem,
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.240]   it's going to be, "Hey, you know what?
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.720]   Maybe Americans, we were slaves to the offices a bit too much.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.360]   We over-indexed on it."
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.400]   And maybe there's some balance because when you do take a four-week vacation and you work
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.000]   half days for two of the weeks, you kind of come back refreshed and you stay with the
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   company longer.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.320]   You don't resent your company and you're not depressed because you feel guilty about not
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.520]   spending time with your kids or not checking the bucket list items.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:23.080]   And I think you're so right about the speed to hire that talented person versus the annoyance
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.480]   of somebody quiet quitting, or somebody's phoning it in, or somebody's working two jobs.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.320]   Like, of course, you're going to have abuse in every system.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.840]   There's abuse in people who come to the office, screwing around with their door closed.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.600]   So you're going to deal with some level of, I don't know, bad actors, whatever.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.280]   And I kind of feel like if you want people to come to the office, it should be because
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.880]   of collaboration, it should be for trust building.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.580]   It shouldn't be for accountability.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:50.440]   We have enough tools digitally that actually, it's frankly easier to track people when they're
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.760]   working digitally than they're in the office because you can actually track everything
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.040]   they're doing and you can just have really good mechanisms like what did you get done
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   today?
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.040]   Yes.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.960]   Actually, we have a whole program manager operation whose job it is to basically tally
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.600]   what everyone's doing.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.640]   And if we don't know what you're doing, then we're not doing our job.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:14.040]   That's I think, why people are so, some of these managers are so aggressive about this
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.780]   is because they don't actually know how to manage.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.420]   And so since they didn't know how to manage, they were managing by the fear of being in
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.420]   the office and the punch clock as opposed to, did you assign the right person to work
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   and did you check the work?
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.100]   And checking the work and assigning the work is a lot of work and prioritizing, as you
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:35.060]   just said, your biggest challenge as the founder is just keeping all this in your head and
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.260]   trying to make the right decision on behalf of the customers.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.980]   And so many managers are phoning it in.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.700]   I came up with the simplest system possible for my investment company, which was at the
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.520]   end of the day, have a cup of coffee and share with the team what you're going to try to
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   accomplish.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.860]   And when you check out for the end of the day, like make it a good checkout so you can
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.540]   go spend time with your family and just say what you got accomplished, if there are any
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.540]   blockers.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.380]   And when people just started doing that in the slack room, it was such a big difference.
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.380]   It was such a big difference.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.180]   And then when somebody left the company, you know, we did we looked at their end of the
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.900]   week, and what they said they got accomplished what they were working on.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:08.020]   And we said, Hey, here's the last three into the weeks, we put it into one document, who
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.420]   should do this job?
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.420]   Should this job be retired?
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.940]   Should it be spread across three people?
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.940]   Should it be outsourced?
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.940]   You can actually look at the granularity, like you're saying, when they do digital work,
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.940]   it's all right there.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.460]   So then you can say, does this position need to be here?
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.340]   Or should it be outsourced or automated?
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.140]   You keep bringing up AI.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:30.780]   And I'm curious, when you start, what are you seeing in AI right now that's getting
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:37.500]   you excited, internally running the company, and then externally in terms of opportunities,
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:42.860]   because travel is such a rich, textured experience, it's also so customized.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.700]   So you know, so much about your customers, you know, when I'm in Japan, you know, my
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:54.620]   trip to France, you know, the different places I've Airbnb'd, you know, who came with me.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.940]   And, you know, whatever else, you know, about the hosts and everything.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.340]   What do you think the opportunity is going to be in travel, specifically for AI?
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:06.860]   Yeah, so let me let me, if you may indulge Jason, I'll like zoom out and just give you
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.460]   like kind of my mental model.
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.140]   And you can tell me if this maps to yours.
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:15.620]   So you have like the base of the foundation, right, the base models, which are basically
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.500]   the large language model.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:21.260]   So of course, GPT-4 is probably the preeminent base model.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:24.860]   Google has some base models, Anthropic has a base model, Microsoft Research has their
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.860]   own base model.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.100]   So you have like three to five big base models.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.980]   I think of those base models as if it's like a highway, they're the highway, they're like
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:33.980]   the infrastructure.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.380]   And, you know, in another generation, by the way, that probably would have been dealt by
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.060]   the government, right?
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.020]   It's almost like the Manhattan Project, these large language models are going to be eventually
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.580]   about $100 billion supercomputers running these models.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.500]   So they're going to be like massive, these are giant infrastructures.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.740]   And we're not going to do that.
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.220]   We don't do infrastructure.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:55.460]   Airbnb, we think of ourselves as designing the cars on the highway.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.860]   So on top of the base model, you have the tuning of the model.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.460]   And the tuning of the model is going to be as good as your sensibility and your customer
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.460]   data.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.700]   So if you and I both ask Chachi Pitya a question, we mostly get the same answer.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.660]   And we mostly get the same answer because it doesn't know who you or I am.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:17.340]   And that's great for some questions, like what was the like, you know, like, how far
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.260]   is the moon from the sun or whatever?
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.900]   Like there's one right answer.
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.740]   But if you ask like, where should I travel?
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.740]   Your answer and my answer are probably different.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.260]   And so some problems are search problems.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.780]   Some problems are kind of matching and personalization preferences problems.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:36.020]   And so what we want to do is we want to be one of the best companies for AI personalization.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.860]   So we want to develop really good tuned models.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.140]   To do that, we have to change our business.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.660]   And actually, one of the questions that Johnny Ive told me when we brought him on the team
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.900]   is he said, you need to switch from beyond, you need to go beyond where and when.
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.460]   Right now, you ask, where are you going?
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.460]   And when are you going?
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.540]   And we need to shift to who and what, who are you and what do you want?
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.300]   And that's really the vision.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.820]   And so what we want to do is we want to build these robust profiles, I want to start to
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:06.340]   learn Jason, who you are, build really good, rich customer information.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.100]   And then I can understand and personalize, like, where do you want to go?
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.300]   And also, what do you want in your life?
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.300]   Like you looking for inspiration, just get out like a, you know, what do you what are
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.300]   you looking for?
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.300]   Do you like want to get healthy?
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.300]   Do you, you know, and you start to learn about people.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.900]   And then we're also pretty good interfaces and the application layer.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.340]   And I think that Airbnb, that's where we're really, really going to focus, we're going
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:31.100]   to focus on the tuning of the models, the most personalized AI interface, and then really
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.100]   good application interfaces.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:37.220]   Now I think as far as interface, I don't think they're all going to be just text based.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.940]   For example, we were working on the open AI plugin, we were one of the first partners
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.260]   that was working with open AI.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.260]   And at the last second, I pulled the plug on the plugin.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.860]   Because I just didn't like the interface.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.260]   I didn't think that was the right way to interface a travel.
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:55.380]   I told Sam, I said, long text outputs are low bandwidth.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:59.500]   And then you give me another text output with widgets at the bottom, I said, I want something
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.940]   much more multimodal, more visual, richer.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.740]   And if you're going to have access to GPT-4, why don't we put it in our app.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.340]   So we pulled the plug on the plugin.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:15.780]   And we think eventually, I think our real vision is Airbnb, at the largest sense, isn't
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.060]   even a product or service.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.780]   I hope it's more like a travel community.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.700]   We're really building a travel community.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:24.780]   And then the role we have the app in the travel community, is eventually we're like the ultimate
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.820]   like AI concierge, right?
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.700]   We're like the ultimate host, like Charles Eames, one of the greatest in our 20th century
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.700]   said, "The role of the designer is that of a thoughtful host, anticipating the needs
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.700]   of the guests."
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:35.700]   So that's what we should do.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.060]   And we understand who are you?
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.060]   What do you want?
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.060]   Where do you want to go?
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.420]   And maybe we could even go beyond travel, if we get there, right?
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:46.980]   And the part of that means you have to trust us to give us your personal information.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.700]   It means we have to be a marriage of art and science.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.020]   It means we have to understand a lot about like human psychology and know what you want.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.020]   It's not just a technical problem.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:54:01.180]   We have to design unique AI interfaces that are probably richer than just text inputs.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:05.740]   Because you know, like, you want to see and feel things, right?
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.740]   And I think it's much more immersive.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.860]   So that's where I think it goes.
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.860]   That's like the long term vision.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:15.260]   In the interim, and that's probably long term is in three to five years.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:18.140]   I mean, that's not even that long term.
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.980]   In the next year, what we're going to do is three things.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.380]   One, engineer productivity or productivity.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.820]   I mean, I think engineers can be 30% more productive in the next three to six months.
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.180]   - It's exactly the number I can put with.
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.660]   I'm watching my team interview founders for investment.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.380]   I'm looking at due diligence.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.540]   And I'm looking at my own behavior.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:41.900]   And it seems like one out of three tasks, I can offload.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.360]   And so I'm like, this is like this year, 30% more efficient, which means headcount stays
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:50.100]   the same, but we just added a third more people like this is unbelievable.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.100]   - It's amazing.
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:55.500]   And by the way, it's actually if everyone's 30% more productive, it's actually more productive
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.180]   than adding 30% more people because you know, the mythical man month, every time you add
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:03.420]   somebody they bring up communication and like, like bring attacks with them.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.660]   So this is like productivity without the tax of more people.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:12.500]   And I think the productivity doubles, you know, in somewhere between one and two years,
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.220]   it's a little hard to know, but it will be double.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.400]   So we'll have the equivalent of twice the engineers without the productivity tax.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.060]   And so that's the first thing is just getting everyone on the tools, give everyone a co-pilot
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.060]   and getting everyone like just immerse.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.660]   And I just bang the drum, like use these tools as much as you can.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.620]   I don't want to be like the Luddites or like afraid of a computer in the 1980s, right?
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.660]   Like we want to be using these tools.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.660]   - That is so key.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:40.440]   I told everybody to make chat GPT for their homepage in their browser, so that every time
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.220]   they open their browser, it just reminds them, hey, use this.
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.980]   And I said, searches is obvious.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.660]   But when I told you they do, they're like, hey, here's what I'm going to accomplish today.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.540]   And here's what I'm going to accomplish at the end of the day.
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:53.700]   I just told everybody, try that in chat GPT and try a plugin.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:58.340]   And by the way, when you were talking about plugins being like not exactly the right modality,
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:02.340]   I've been using OpenTable, Expedia, Kayak the last couple of days for travel, trying
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.760]   to see if it works.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:09.020]   And it's not as good as using some of the other like native interfaces yet.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:13.520]   I mean, I'm sure it'll get better, but I agree that it needs to be visual and it's got a
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:14.520]   long ways to go.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.520]   - OpenAI is a choice.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:20.260]   They can either invest a ton on the interface layer, or they can decide that they're the
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.700]   brain and other people decide the interface.
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.820]   Either way it can work.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:28.580]   But either way, the interfaces, here's the thing I'd say, do you remember when like the
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:32.700]   iPhone launched and Steve said like, the problem with most smartphones is the bottom half of
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.900]   the screen, the interface doesn't change?
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:40.440]   I think that we should think of every task as wanting a distinct interface.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.940]   Like you have a hammer to get a nail in, you have a screwdriver for a screw, you have a
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.580]   spatula to scoop something up.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.940]   Every interface should be custom designed exactly for the task.
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:53.620]   - Do you think it's voice for travel or do you think it's flipping through videos that
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.660]   are TikTok style and then understanding which ones people spend more time on?
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.660]   - I don't think it's voice.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.980]   I think voice is for commodities.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:05.300]   So if you basically say I need to go from here to there, and there's no inputs, there's
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.060]   no decision making or visual discretion in voice.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:12.180]   I think it's more like, I don't want to say like minority report, but I have this image
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:19.420]   of like, it's an immersive interface where it's words and images, and it's a conversational
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.780]   bot, but it's not pure text.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:25.340]   It's got lots of rich visuals, videos, photos.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.380]   It's a little hard to describe.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:27.380]   I have to build a prototype.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.740]   - I haven't seen Minority Report.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:32.260]   He puts on a pair of gloves, which MIT was working on at the time, and he's just moving
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.340]   stuff around in a virtual desktop.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.900]   - That's conceptually what I'm talking about.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.820]   - Yeah, I think it's actually a pretty brilliant one because if you think about the function
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:43.140]   of magazines, which is how people did this previously, you flip through a magazine, what
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.140]   would you see in a magazine?
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:51.340]   A subhead, a headline, a table, an infographic, a picture, a two-page spread, a table.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:56.060]   And all of that was evocative and kind of pulled you in, and I actually really think
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:01.460]   with this vision of trying to understand me as a person, psychologically and where I'm
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:07.260]   going next, oh, Jason's doing more skiing, oh, he's got a bucket list of places he wants
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:12.980]   to go skiing, ah, he's really into food, and that trust you've built up is interesting
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:17.620]   as well because I would have no problem authenticating with Instagram and giving you all my photos,
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:23.060]   and with AI, you could just tell from my photos that I take pictures of a lot of food, and
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.140]   I take a lot of pictures of skiing.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.740]   You now know a lot about me, and I don't have to tell you, you just know my Instagram account.
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:35.380]   - And I think the problem is all of us, and Airbnb is part of this problem, you come to
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:39.580]   Airbnb and it looks the same as it did the last time you came, and we're like a marketplace,
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:43.100]   and everything's a transaction, and we assume you're like, we don't know anything about
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:46.380]   you, and you just walked into a store, and we got a bunch of stuff on a shelf.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:52.300]   And I think that's a very 1990s, 2000s Amazon paradigm of commerce, and I think the future
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:57.060]   of commerce is more like somebody showing you around, and they understand you deeply,
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:00.420]   and you have so much more control, and it's significantly more personalized, and everyone
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.060]   has a unique experience.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:05.020]   And so that's where I think it goes, and I think that we don't have a search problem
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.820]   in the future, we have a matching problem.
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:12.180]   So we are gonna use AI to match you to whatever you want, and I think that, the other thing
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:16.900]   is, I think we're gonna be really good at hopefully identity authentication.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.220]   You know, the problem with AI is, what's the first word in AI?
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.220]   Artificial.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:27.020]   The biggest risk before machines come after us is they become us, and we can't discern
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.180]   who is a machine and who is not.
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.380]   And I think that we're already seeing that.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.340]   I mean, when that Pope photo circulated, I thought that was a real photo at first.
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.740]   - I did too, I was like, that's weird, the Pope is going for it.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.020]   - Yeah, I was like, pretty awesome, he's got Balenciaga, go for him.
[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.460]   But that's today's technology.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.860]   So we're about to live in a world where someone can sound like me, they can behave like me,
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.020]   and as we spend more and more time online, it's gonna be harder to discern what is real
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.020]   and what's not real.
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:56.100]   So I think in the age of artificial intelligence, the other thing people want is authenticity.
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.500]   And authenticity is whatever's real, and whatever's authenticated.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.860]   So I think our brand is kind of authenticity, like we're not gonna ever be the most digitally
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.300]   immersive company.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.860]   That's gonna be social media or entertainment.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.700]   Our value is really the physical world.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.740]   We get you online, offline, with people different from you all over the world.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.380]   And that comes with starting with knowing who you are, authenticating your identity.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:21.300]   Eventually, we may use biometrics, because right now we use like a government ID.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:25.860]   But I think eventually, I want to do something with biometrics to be much more robust, so
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.460]   you can't really get around it.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:31.740]   And then we have your identity, you trust us, we build this incredibly robust personal
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.740]   profile.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.780]   And then we can just match you and we are the then and then hopefully, we're really
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.460]   good interfaces.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.380]   And we use the latest, greatest language models.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:45.860]   - Yeah, it's pretty amazing how fast these are working, and what's going to be possible,
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.460]   because we don't know what it's going to match people with over time.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:56.500]   I don't know necessarily what's going to delight me, but every time I go somewhere in the world
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.540]   that somebody else introduces me to, like my guide on the side, a friend, if you told
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:06.020]   me, "Hey, you gotta try this place in San Francisco, cafe, Okinawa that I've been going
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.140]   to to get tonkatsu sandwiches."
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:12.740]   I told like three people about this, because I love these when I go to Japan, and everybody
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.980]   goes there and they're like, "Oh yeah, you're right, that was great."
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.540]   And now they spread to the next person, and that kind of word of mouth, I think like this
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.700]   AI is going to find little things like that, where it didn't know that this was something
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.300]   that you would be delighted by.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.300]   - Totally.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.300]   - And it's such an opportunity.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.300]   - I think it's amazing.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.420]   And by the way, I think I heard another, one of your podcasts, you said something that
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.220]   really resonates that I think it's just worth calling out.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.140]   The cost to develop software is about to go down, and maybe a good analogy, Jason, would
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.140]   be like the camera.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.700]   130 years ago, very few people could operate a camera.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:47.660]   And so, therefore, you had to be a specialist to take a photo, and there weren't a lot of
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.660]   photos.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.820]   Suddenly, computer programming is just basically telling a computer to do something in its
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.820]   language.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.640]   AI means you can now tell a computer to do something in your language.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.820]   The moment you don't have to learn a different language, you can use your natural language
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.660]   to English, suddenly kind of everyone in a way can be a programmer like everyone's a
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.660]   photographer.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.660]   You don't have to actually have a skill.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.260]   Now, there will be programming skills, but suddenly anyone can do that.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.100]   Now when that's possible, there's going to be so much more software.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.220]   We're going to live in an abundance of software.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:19.620]   I think in a podcast, you referenced like a ski instructor or a ski company, like a
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.220]   niche business that couldn't have developed, hired great software engineers, but now they
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:28.500]   can become the best engineer you've ever had developing their app.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.340]   And so, suddenly the skills start to be different.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:35.740]   We have to understand skiing, human psychology, taste, design, and how to operate and have
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.940]   a conversation with that tool, but you don't have to necessarily build the infrastructure.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:45.180]   It's like we never built servers because we had AWS, but if we launched five years earlier,
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.180]   we would have had to have been really good at like kind of building out servers.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.180]   Rack and stacking servers.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:53.420]   I mean, your first half a million would have went towards a co-location facility.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.820]   And now it's like, you're just going to talk to this thing and it's going to make your
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   software for you.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.860]   So I think this is going to create, I think this is going to create millions of startups.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:05.420]   I think that like, entrepreneurship is going to be a boon.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.820]   I think there's going to be millions more.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.420]   I think anyone can essentially do the equivalent of what software engineering only allowed
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.380]   you to do only five years ago.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.860]   It's going to be awesome for many people.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.180]   It's going to be wildly disruptive for others.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:19.260]   Albert Einstein used to have a saying, the best way to keep your balance in a bicycle
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.260]   is to keep moving.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:23.800]   And I think the best way to keep your balance in the world of AI is to keep moving forward
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.300]   and just adopt the tools.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.940]   Don't fight it and see where it takes us.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.940]   But it's going to be pretty wild.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.940]   So interesting you say that.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:35.460]   I was just looking, the Writer's Guild was going on strike and like on the second page,
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:39.700]   the third thing from the bottom was their update on AI.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:44.140]   And they're like, we're seeking a ban of using AI in the writer's room, using AI to ingest
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:49.300]   previous scripts, and using AI to generate future scripts and dialogue.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:55.080]   And it said, the most the studios will commit to is doing a yearly review with the union
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.700]   about technology.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:01.180]   And it's like, don't you realize you could ingest the entirety of the Simpsons or every
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:05.620]   late night joke, and then you would start on second or third base with all these incredible
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:10.060]   ideas and brainstorms for jokes, and the jokes would get better, and the shows would be more
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.060]   compelling.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.060]   You're totally right.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.500]   I think trying to ban AI is like trying to ban electricity.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.100]   You're going to be on the wrong side of history.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.740]   The genie's out of the bottle, you can't put it back in the bottle.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.800]   And I think that, here's the problem, Jason.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.340]   I think it's easier to imagine what jobs will be displaced than what jobs will be created.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:30.840]   Because we can imagine everything that now AI can do.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.060]   We can't imagine everything it hasn't yet done, because that requires us to conceive
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.500]   of what doesn't exist.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.860]   But if we remember that in all other periods in history, technology created jobs that didn't
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860]   exist.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.860]   This can do that too.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.620]   It doesn't mean we should be blindly ignorant or not be concerned.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.180]   There's a lot of concerns I have about AI.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.860]   I'm concerned about how fast it's going, and is society prepared for the speed.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.460]   But I think from a creative standpoint, as a person who went to Rhode Island School of
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:00.200]   Design, I would tell the creative community, you only have to be worried if you don't want
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.200]   to be a part of it.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.460]   Because this is a creative tool for you.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.240]   You know, computers are tools.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.260]   The reason they put a handle on the back of the iMac was they used to have a saying at
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:13.460]   Apple, "Never trust a computer you can't throw out the window."
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.500]   Computers are tools and AI is a tool.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.280]   And I think if we think of it as a tool, then it's a tool for creativity.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.820]   And you're right, you start in third base.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:24.420]   Like, I'm already noticing at Chachibit, like, it makes my writing better.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:29.380]   I don't use - I actually don't use most of what Chachibit gives me back, but it gives
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.860]   me some words.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.260]   And I'm like, "Summarize this."
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.100]   The cold start problem is solved, because you're like, "Hey, I want to write about,
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.340]   I want to make a marketing plan."
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.220]   And it's like, "Oh, well, here's what goes in a marketing plan."
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.260]   You're like, "Oh, yeah, points two and seven, let me double down on those."
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:47.060]   Or I can like, I can have a thousand word thing, say, summarizes in four sentences,
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.860]   and maybe I don't use the four sentences, but it gives me ideas.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.380]   By the way, before we go, I want to say, one, I keep discovering new uses for Chachibit.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.380]   Here's the coolest use I've discovered.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:02.100]   I asked Chachibit a question, "At the most fundamental level, what business are we in?"
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:06.620]   And then it spits out a not super insightful answer, like, "Airbnb is the business of travel
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.460]   and experiences and blah, blah, blah."
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.300]   And then I - the cool thing that you should do this, is ask a follow-up, and keep asking
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.300]   follow-ups until I can't do it anymore.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.660]   And so I ask, "What's a more fundamental business?"
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.740]   And it goes, "Actually, a more fundamental business that Airbnb is in is sharing."
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.020]   And I go, "Okay, but what's a more fundamental business?"
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.220]   Then it goes, "A more fundamental business is human connection."
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:27.500]   And I go, "What's a more fundamental?"
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.500]   And it just keeps going.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.500]   - Joy!
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.980]   - And you, but you start to learn, and it teaches you its first principles, right?
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:33.980]   - Yes.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:34.980]   It reduces it down.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:36.980]   - And then I did the same thing with AI.
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.940]   I said, "How can AI transform Airbnb?"
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.700]   And it has these really small ideas.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.220]   And then I go, "How can do it even bigger?"
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.740]   And you keep doing it.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.660]   And so if you keep going, go bigger, or go more fundamental.
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.660]   Keep going.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.660]   - Yeah.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.660]   Take more risk.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.660]   - AI starts to teach.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:57.620]   It helps you discover the first principles in really interesting ideas, which I think
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:02.620]   the follow-up questions with these chatbots are always more important than the first question.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.620]   - Yeah.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.220]   It really gets interesting the third or fourth time.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:09.900]   And as you said, I think one of the most profound things you've said here is, "We don't know
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.420]   what jobs can be created because they haven't been created yet."
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.420]   - Yes.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.900]   - And if you look at marketplaces, whether it's eBay, whether it's Etsy, whether it's
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:23.740]   Airbnb, whether it's Uber or DoorDash, to different extents, these allowed people to
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.380]   create new careers for themselves.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.380]   - Yeah.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:31.580]   - And how many people do we know now who became real estate magnates and they own 20 properties
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.580]   because of how well their first two properties did on Airbnb?
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:38.820]   Or they have collections on Etsy or Kickstarter.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.700]   And who knows what this is gonna lead to, but it's going to...
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.340]   Unless there's not enough problems and not enough human creativity and energy, then this
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.980]   is gonna be incredible for society, I believe.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.980]   - Exactly.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.740]   - I'm an optimist about it, and I'm using it every day for multiple hours a day.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.420]   I'm playing with the plugins, the web tools.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:02.220]   And I just started on Repl.it, like, putting up bounties, and I started a Python course
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.460]   because I'm like, "I just wanna know how to, like, stitch this stuff together," because
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.700]   the auto-GPTs, to me, are where this gets really wild.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:09.700]   - Oh, yes.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:14.220]   - If you could start putting a couple of the ideas we talked about today on autopilot and
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:19.100]   then say, "Hey," and try to make a better result every day, it could just be trying
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.820]   to make a better result for how Airbnb understands my travel taste.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:27.420]   And you say, "Hey, just keep trying to get information from Jason, ask him some interesting
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:31.740]   probing questions, or look at his social media and try to give him better ideas," and then
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:35.620]   I give the thumbs up, thumbs down, either implicitly or explicitly, and you just start
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.620]   understanding me.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.540]   Hey, listen, I know you gotta go.
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.580]   This has been amazing, dude.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.260]   I'm so glad we got to finally do this.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.260]   - I know.
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.260]   Thank you for having me.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.260]   - We'll talk again soon.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.260]   We gotta not wait so long.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.260]   - Let's do it, yeah.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.860]   Well, you know, the thing is, like, I had all these notes about, like, the blocking
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.300]   and tackling.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:55.260]   Like all great conversations, I think, and great CEOs, you've got some things on your
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:59.660]   mind about how you're architecting the company and then AI that are really profound.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.220]   So, if you're an entrepreneur, you're gonna wanna listen to this with your team and probably
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:08.820]   don't put it on 2X speed because Brian and I both talk pretty quick.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:14.100]   But a great conversation, bookend it with the Joe interview, and we'll see you all next
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.100]   time on This Week in Stardust.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:15.100]   Bye-bye.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:15.600]   - Bye-bye.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.100]   - Bye-bye.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:16.600]   - Bye-bye.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   - Bye-bye.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.100]   - Bye-bye.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.100]   - Bye-bye.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:19.600]   - Bye-bye.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:32.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
