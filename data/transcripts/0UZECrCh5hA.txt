[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Many questions in our inbox are questions that I could never anticipate myself, like
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   this one today.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.040]   It's sent to us by a listener named Jessica.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.760]   Here's what Jessica writes us.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.600]   "Hello Pastor John and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.280]   I was recently confronted by an abortion advocate about a chapter in the Bible.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.240]   I was then and remain now quite perplexed about its meaning.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.160]   We read that suspicion of infidelity in the Old Testament triggered a potentially dangerous
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.320]   ritual in which a woman was put on trial, made to drink a potion of sorts, and if she
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.860]   was found guilty, the verdict was rendered in a physical consequence.
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.240]   The verses are Numbers 5, 22 and 27, Numbers chapter 5, verse 22 and 27, texts which say
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.080]   that the adulterous woman's "thigh shall fall away."
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.160]   That's the ESV translation, "thigh shall fall away," which doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.880]   Other translations say the consequence is "miscarriage and untimely birth."
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.760]   That's according to the NEB and REB translations.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.640]   Basically, a guilty verdict was rendered by an induced abortion.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.560]   In fact, that's the interpretation I found in Old Testament scholar Norman Henry Snath's
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.880]   commentary on Leviticus and Numbers.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.080]   On linguistic grounds, he says "cause and abortion" is a possible interpretation here.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   I was surprised.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.280]   Pastor John, how would you respond to this?
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:45.160]   My response is first to ask, was this abortion advocate seriously willing to follow where
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:54.680]   the Scriptures lead, or was this simply a superficial cheap shot because a text might
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.840]   picture God as aborting a child?
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.440]   I don't know the answer to that question, but it would make a difference personally
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.420]   in how I spoke to that person directly.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.680]   My second response is to say that I don't think we can have any confidence that this
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.900]   text describes an abortion or a God-caused miscarriage.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.120]   In fact, I think a good case can be made that this is not what's happening, and I'll come
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.360]   back to that.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.640]   My third response is that even if God were pictured here as bringing about the miscarriage
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.560]   as part of the punishment for adultery, that would not give us any right at all to take
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.440]   the life of the unborn.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.360]   All of life is in God's hands.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.160]   He owns it.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.360]   He gives it and he takes it according to his own infinite wisdom.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.400]   It's his, and therefore he gives it where we can't and he takes it where we shouldn't
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.520]   because we are not God.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.960]   So let me say a word about each of those three responses.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:20.120]   If a person comes to us with a biblical objection to our pro-life position, it may be that the
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   most helpful and hopeful thing that we could do is sincerely offer them to sit down and
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.520]   do a study, a serious study together with them, of what the whole Bible has to say about
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.600]   the unborn and the rights we have or don't have to intrude upon God's person-forming
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.320]   work in the womb, as it says in Psalm 139.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.880]   That might be the test of the sincerity of their objection.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.600]   Second, let's look at what the text actually says in Numbers 5.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   The situation is that a husband has accused his wife of committing adultery against him,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.480]   but he has no proof.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.680]   He brings her to the priest who sets up a test to determine her guilt or innocence.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.320]   He mixes holy water with dust from the tabernacle floor and has her drink it.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.360]   Significantly, the test is designed so that her innocence is assumed and what has to be
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.240]   proved is her guilt, not her innocence.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.480]   The ordeal is favorable for the defendant, namely the woman.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.920]   In other words, it's not as though if nothing happens, she's guilty.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   No.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.560]   Something extraordinary has to happen to prove her guilt, indeed something supernatural.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.100]   The assumption is God will decide this case.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.640]   If she's guilty, verse 22 describes what will happen.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.940]   Here's the wording.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:12.680]   May this water that brings the curse pass into your bowels and make your womb swell
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.240]   and your thigh fall away.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.520]   If that does not happen, she's innocent.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:28.440]   Now, Jessica points out that some interpreters take this falling away of the thigh as a miscarriage
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   or an induced abortion from God.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.760]   This is a pure guess.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:44.220]   Nobody knows for sure what those words falling away of the thigh mean.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.160]   That wording is not a common idiom, not as though the writer used an idiom here that
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.340]   we all know from elsewhere means miscarriage.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.500]   We don't.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.800]   We only have this context to go on.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.680]   And I think the text, the context here, points in a different direction.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:12.040]   First of all, the Hebrew word for thigh can mean hip, as it does when Jacob's hip is put
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:19.380]   out of joint, or can mean loins, including the sexual organs, as when Abraham's servant
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.420]   swears by putting his hand in that sacred place of reproduction.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:34.360]   The falling of the woman's loins would be a very odd way to describe a miscarriage,
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.040]   but it would not be an odd way to describe a vaginal prolapse.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.720]   A prolapse, which my grandmother had to have surgery for while she was living with Noel
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.300]   and me, that's why I know about this.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.780]   A prolapse is what happens when the pelvis muscles and tissues can no longer support
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.800]   the female sexual organs because the muscles and tissues are weak or damaged, which causes
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.660]   one or more of the pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.600]   Now that's an easily treatable situation today with surgery.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.960]   In those days, that must have been hard.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:28.860]   And then notice verse 28 shows us what this punishment involves by contrasting it with
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.160]   the woman who proves innocent.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.040]   Here's what it says in verse 28.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:40.840]   But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.960]   conceive children.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.240]   In other words, the focus of the punishment is not on miscarriage, but on the fact that
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.520]   the innocent will go on to have children and the guilty woman won't, because that's the
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   effect of the falling of the loins, I'm suggesting.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.840]   Now, suppose my interpretation is wrong, which it could be because none of us knows for sure
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   what the falling away of the thigh or the loins means.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:22.600]   And suppose this text really does say God, the just judge, decreed that the child in
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.400]   the woman, supposing there was one, doesn't say, was aborted.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   Suppose that.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:38.680]   What does that tell us about the life of the unborn and our right to take it or not?
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.000]   And the answer is nothing, nothing, because we are not God.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.080]   God says in Deuteronomy 32, 29, "See now that I, even I, am he.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.520]   There is no God besides me.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.720]   I kill and I make alive.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.880]   I wound and I heal.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.600]   There is none that can deliver out of my hand."
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:06.640]   In other words, to be God is to have rights over life and death that others don't have.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.800]   Hannah speaks for God in the same way in 1 Samuel 2, 6, when she says, "The Lord kills
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.080]   and the Lord brings to life.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.760]   He brings down to Sheol and raises up."
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.880]   And Job, when he lost all ten of his children, said, and the verse following says he didn't
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:34.760]   sin when he said this, "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.320]   Let it be the name of the Lord."
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:44.040]   In other words, one of the things it means to be God is to have absolute rights over
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.280]   human life.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.400]   God made all life.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   All life belongs to him.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:10:00.920]   Only God can say, Ezekiel 18, 4, in truth, "Behold, all souls are mine."
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:11.480]   Therefore, God's decision to take the life of an unborn child does not give us any permission
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.800]   to do the same.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:21.240]   Any more than God's giving us his own son in crucifixion gives us the right to kill
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.880]   Jesus.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:33.040]   God ordains the death of his own son not to legitimate murder, but to make it possible
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.960]   for murderers to be saved, including those who take the life of the unborn.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   Amen.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.600]   Thank you, Pastor John, for taking up this fascinating question.
