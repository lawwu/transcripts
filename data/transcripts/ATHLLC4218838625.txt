[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.720]   totally free to join.

[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.600]   Hello everyone.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920]   And welcome to All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life, money, and
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.800]   travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.240]   I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.640]   And it is so great to have you here for a really exciting episode.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.920]   If you've never been a fan of basketball, you might not recognize our guests, but I
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.800]   can assure you it's a conversation you won't want to miss.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.720]   And if you are a fan, then I'm sure you'll recognize NBA legend Manu Ginobili.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.560]   Though by the end of this episode, you might refer to him as minivan driving,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   savvy investing, credit card points obsessive NBA legend, Manu Ginobili.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.040]   Manu grew up playing basketball in Argentina and started his professional
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.000]   career in 1995 playing in the EuroLeague.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.040]   In '99, the San Antonio Spurs picked Manu with the second to last pick in the
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.000]   entire NBA draft, but he wasn't offered a spot on the team right away.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.840]   So he kept playing in the EuroLeague, leading his team to win the 2001 championship.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.360]   Finally, the next year he joined the Spurs roster and played his entire
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.640]   16-year NBA career with the team, where they made the playoffs all 16 years, won
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.800]   an NBA championship four times, and Manu was named a two-time NBA all-star.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   If that wasn't enough, he led team Argentina to an Olympic gold in 2002,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.840]   which was, and still is, the only time Team USA has lost gold since 1988.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.560]   In fact, he is only one of two players in basketball history to win the EuroLeague,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.960]   an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA championship.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.920]   He retired in 2018 at 40 years old after playing professional basketball for 23
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.600]   years. If that seems long, it's because the average NBA career is only four and a
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.160]   half years. In fact, only 30 people in history have ever played into their 40s.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.680]   In our conversation, we'll discuss how Manu pushed his mind and body to play on
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.040]   one of the world's biggest stages longer than everyone else.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.200]   This includes talking about training, fitness, diet, mindfulness practices, and
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.600]   more. But that's not all we'll be talking about.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.600]   There's another side of Manu that few people know about, and it's a big part of
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.880]   why I asked him to join me on all the hacks.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.720]   While there are so many professional athletes out there buying fancy cars and
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.440]   watches with big stacks of cash, Manu was pulling up to the AT&T center in his
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.600]   minivan and always making sure he used the right one of his five credit cards to
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   rack up the most points he could.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   This is going to be a fantastic conversation, so let's jump in.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.040]   Manu, thanks for being here.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.320]   Pleasure to be here, man.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.200]   Yeah, so I'm just going to kick it off.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.680]   I read a New York Times article this morning, and it's from 2017.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.600]   And it said that you're two times more likely than the rest of the population to
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.240]   do the career your parents did.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.200]   And I know you grew up around basketball and you played when you were young.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.640]   What was that like?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.360]   And how much do you think that pushed you into the sport?
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.640]   Or do you think it was more internal desire?
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   Well, my father was a big fan of the sport, was actually the president of Boys
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.760]   and Girls Club in my local city.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.120]   And I spent a lot and I mean, a lot of time shooting hoops and playing with
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.800]   whoever was at the gym.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.960]   I just got very lucky that my genetic code propitiated my basketball abilities
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.520]   and that I had a strong desire to do well.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.680]   I really loved it from minute one.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.560]   And the combination of things sparked my career.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.800]   And do you think your younger self ever would have imagined the career you had?
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.160]   Not in a million years, I could visualize early that playing in Argentina at a
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.920]   high level, maybe with the national team, then later with maybe in Europe.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.640]   But having had a career like this, winning multiple NBA championships and
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.560]   playing for 16 years in the NBA, that was impossible to forecast because there was
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.520]   not one Argentinian in history that played in the NBA when I was a kid.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.200]   So for us, it was unreachable, was something impossible.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.920]   And Michael Jordan was an alien that came from somewhere else to play hoops.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.880]   No, it was not part of the equation at all.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.200]   And has that changed now?
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.760]   Have you have you changed the kind of aspirations of Argentinian basketball
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.360]   players now?
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.720]   Well, after so many years now, I think we are 15 players from Argentina that ended
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.880]   up playing in the NBA, some for a few games, some others for for many.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.680]   So the NBA became that this world league, more than an American league, became more
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.320]   of a goal, something more reachable than what it was for me.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.160]   They've done a great job recruiting and drafting talent all over the world.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.200]   So basically every, every single country have one participant in the
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.160]   NBA in the last 10 years.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   So it's, it changed a lot.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.440]   Yeah, and your career didn't start in the NBA.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.200]   So I know you kind of had an atypical NBA career.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.680]   I think you were maybe 25 when you finally got to the NBA.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.400]   And like you said, first player from Argentina.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.440]   How did that path of being an outsider coming in late play into your role and
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.560]   how it changed over time?
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.960]   First of all, I wasn't ready at all at 20.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.000]   I was a late bloomer.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.880]   So at 18, I was not even close.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.280]   At 20, I wasn't ready either.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.560]   And I needed the, the extra work and the extra time in Europe to, to develop my
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.280]   game, to, to grow physically, mentally.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.960]   So even the day I got drafted at 22, I had zero expectations of being drafted.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.760]   And I think the Spurs either, they got me at number 57 and I didn't even know the
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.880]   draft was held that day.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.680]   So I was a late bloomer.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.560]   I had different types of expectations for my career.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.520]   And, but, but it just slowly happened.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:49.000]   And some goals, I reached some goals and then put the next one and then the next
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.160]   one, and all of a sudden I, all of a sudden I felt, I found myself at 25 playing for
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.320]   the, for the Spurs.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.240]   So the benefit of all that was that I saw basically everything.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.760]   I was a backup in Argentina as a small league.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.520]   Then I was playing in second division in Italy.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.040]   Then I moved to a very good team in Italy and I was supposed to be a six man there.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.840]   And the following year was more of a, the go-to guy in the championship team.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:29.960]   So I went through every stage to the NBA and made me, I think, value way more where
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.520]   I was at every stage.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.280]   So I, from, from day one here in the NBA, I never took anything for granted.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.640]   It was just a long way.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.000]   It took me to get here and I was going to use it as well as I could.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.160]   A lot of the people I know, whether they're in sports or entrepreneurs, they
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.440]   find that they have this skill and they're successful early on in the career.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.800]   And they're sometimes difficult to be coached.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.520]   You know, they think they have everything.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.080]   It seems like you appreciated the value of coaching and
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.960]   learning early on in your career.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.840]   Is that true?
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.480]   How did that evolve and how are your relationships with coaches?
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.520]   I had very good relationships with every coach I had.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.400]   I'm not sure where that, where that comes from.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.720]   I wasn't, I've never been a rebellious type of guy.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   I never challenged the authority or I just follow the rules and try to accommodate
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   my skills to what I was being asked and try to bend those rules slowly.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.480]   The way, the way it happened with, with Bob, with, with the Spurs, but
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.360]   trying to, within the system, try to use my skills the best way I could.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.880]   But I both, well, actually everywhere I played in Italy, national team, NBA,
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.240]   or, or in Argentina, I still have good relationship with my coach.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.960]   And do you think the, the value of coaching applied equally
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.200]   throughout your career when you were just getting started, but
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.720]   you're kind of towards the end?
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.440]   How did, how did that change over time?
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.240]   In the last 16 years, I had only one coach basically with the Spurs and
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.520]   he helped me grew as a man, as a player.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.240]   So I had the utmost respect for him, both on the court and off the court.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:20.320]   In, in the national team, we had only three coaches in the 20
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   years I played there basically.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.520]   So that time allows you to, to create a bond, a connection and a way of
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.880]   communicating that goes beyond only words and, but times are great times.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.840]   So you know exactly who you got next to you.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:42.000]   So I know I'm, I'm part of a 1% or even less of players that, you know, had
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.880]   one coach for the career or so many.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   So it's a few amount of different type of personalities.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.240]   It's just only a handful.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   So I've been very lucky in that regard.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.560]   And I, we had a great relationship with, with all of them.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.880]   I mean, you said very few people have that.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.200]   What do you think led to you being with the same team the whole time when I'm
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.240]   sure you had teammates coming and going the entire experience?
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:15.160]   Well, I think that I fit, I fit in this organization and I was very lucky to
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.440]   have RC and Bob that really liked me, really love having me around and what I
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:26.040]   gave the team both on and off the court, because it depended on them, not only on
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.400]   me, then on my side, I, I just was happy here.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.640]   So I was not willing to go look for something else somewhere because I
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   didn't care about markets.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.560]   I didn't care about being on, having more time on TV or something like that.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.360]   I was fine.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.280]   And we were winning and we had a great environment and we had a great
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.480]   family structure here in San Antonio.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:54.160]   So for most of my career, I didn't even consider going somewhere else.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.000]   There were a couple of times that maybe I entertained it because I didn't
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.040]   know what was going to happen.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.480]   But overall, I just been super lucky to, to have been part of
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.560]   this, this incredible organization.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.920]   And for so many years, sharing teams with the same core group of
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.360]   guys, very, very unusual in, in the NBA and in today's NBA, even less.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.280]   It's amazing that you had such a, an incredible career for so long with one
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.880]   team, a common theme, talking to people that played with you over your whole
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.800]   career, hearing people say that nobody could figure you out.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.680]   You were the toughest to defend their tapes of every game.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.000]   And you played almost probably with playoffs and everything, a hundred games
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.040]   a year, how did you manage to keep that mystery alive and evolve your style in
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   a way that people, even as you were retiring, couldn't figure you out?
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.520]   Was that you?
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   Was that coaches?
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.960]   Was that a combination?
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.480]   I had no idea, man.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.240]   I kept hearing some, some of the comments of some all stars and some
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.760]   other great defenders that, and I thought I was pretty straightforward with my game.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.920]   Even, even though I wanted to go left, if I couldn't go left, then I, well, I would
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.960]   make some sort of move to go back left.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.800]   And if not, I started to develop some counter moves, like a step back, going
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.600]   right, or some little tools, but, um, I never saw that.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.040]   I never felt it.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.520]   It's not that I'm just saying it because it sounds well or something, even the,
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   this, the Euro step that, that now is a word that we all heard before it didn't
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.360]   exist, I didn't know I was doing anything unusual.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:39.840]   I was using the only tool I had to go by guys like that were 50 to 60 pounds
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.200]   heavier and taller, and you could jump more than me.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.880]   So I couldn't go over them vertically.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   So I had to go sideways.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:54.040]   And for me, for me, it was so natural and so automatic, but then I started to, you
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.280]   know, to hear people talk about that, how unique it was that I look like a squirrel.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.160]   Going between the cars and stuff like that.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.520]   So again, where, where did it come from?
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.160]   No clue.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.440]   I just play the only way I, I could to survive in this, in this harsh
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.680]   environment of super athletes.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.480]   I mean, super athletes is, is unbelievable, right?
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.360]   You're on the main stage for a game played around the world.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.720]   And, and it's not just raw talent, right?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.560]   I have to imagine that to do everything that a professional NBA player does.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.280]   It's, it's more than that.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.040]   It's also about grit and willpower and determination.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.720]   I've heard you say that most players in any sport lose more than they win.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.880]   How do you push yourself forward when, you know, you're operating in such an
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.160]   uncertain league in terms of what'll happen next season, in terms of whether
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   you've won or lost, how do you, how did you get through that mentally and how did
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.840]   you push yourself through all the hard times?
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.520]   Well, I wasn't good at that at the beginning.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.240]   I didn't take losses accountably.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.640]   I was very tough on myself.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.880]   I was always being very competitive.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:12.040]   And I always mentioned that it's not that I, I nourished or I tried to be competitive.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.360]   I was competitive from, from day one.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.000]   I competed even with my brothers for grades.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.800]   I competed with friends about who had the best, whatever, shot from
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.240]   half court or whatever, at anything I competed hard and that brings a lot
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.520]   of obsession sort of, because I didn't want to lose at anything.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.040]   And I, I dragged that all my career.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.480]   And I never, maybe until the last three, four years, I really
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.640]   never learned to lose properly.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.680]   I took it too hard and it was very strict on myself.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:55.600]   And it's a, it's a skill that I had to, to develop, to, to think about it,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   to read about it, to talk about it.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.680]   And then towards the end, when, when my performance was starting to decay in
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:09.400]   some way, in some way, I was not the same as before, I started to, to be nicer to,
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.800]   to myself, right, to, to allow more mistakes, to accept that the time was
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.480]   doing its thing and that I was not as fast as before, and I was not as effective
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.000]   and that everything was hurting longer than before.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.320]   And that's when I started to, to learn and enjoy other things too.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.080]   But it took me a while.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.840]   I was quite, quite obsessed for the biggest chunk of my career.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.680]   Are there things that you think if you knew them earlier in your career, it
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.480]   would have made it easier to deal with losing?
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.680]   For sure.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.160]   I could have loved to be nicer to myself.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:53.560]   As I, as I said before, it was sometimes too much and maybe that drove me to be
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   better, to add other skills or to prepare for a game, both mentally and physically
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:07.160]   better, but maybe on the satisfaction or happiness level at the present time, I
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.840]   could have been much better.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.160]   So, you know, it's, it's a matter of priorities for sure.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.640]   I would tell my, the younger me to be nicer, to relax a little bit, to accept
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.160]   that sometimes you're going to lose because there's so there's 30 teams and
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.080]   only one wins.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:32.360]   So those were some of the things that I, I would have liked to accept early on.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   Because I, I would say my last three years were wonderful mentally and even
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.680]   physically because I was 38, 39 and 40.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.720]   And I'm basically, I had no, no injuries before I did.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:52.360]   And I was mentally in a great spot that really helped me to, to thrive, even not
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.600]   having the first step as I used to or the explosiveness.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.760]   I mean, you just brought up playing in your late thirties and even at 40.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.080]   So I did some homework.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.840]   It looks like about 30 people ever have played in the NBA in their forties.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.760]   And right now I think there's one player over 37.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.240]   So I guess the question is not a long one.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.840]   It's how, like, was it diet routine?
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.160]   Like what led you to do this thing that currently there's one person doing in the
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.480]   world?
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.200]   Again, as always, it's a big, big combination of things, right?
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.360]   I can't underestimate the value of luck.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.760]   I never had a big Achilles tendon injury or ACL or NCL or whatever.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.200]   Something that could really affect my career.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.320]   All my injuries or surgeries were minor scopes.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.400]   You miss a month here and there, and then you're back.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.120]   So, so that helped, of course.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.760]   The other thing that I think I, I did well is to take care of my body, right?
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.800]   I was never, even when I was young, much of a excess type of guy, I didn't go out.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.840]   I didn't do drugs, alcohol.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:11.640]   I had a pretty steady routine towards basketball, but then at 35, when I started
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.960]   to see more muscular problems, more strains and tears and things like that, I, I had
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.600]   to make a decision if I was going to just struggle to the end of my career, or if I
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.360]   was going to be in a good spot, even though, as I said before, I was not going to be
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.640]   that fast or recover that quick.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:39.360]   But I, at that time I started to adjust my sleeping patterns, eating patterns, my
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.200]   therapy, stretching and mobility, breathing, and a lot of little tools.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.840]   So at 35, I hired my own physio that came and lived with me basically one month, one
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.360]   week a month, because he lived in Spain and he really took care of me.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:04.120]   The spurs also improved their, their staff and to compliment all that, Pap
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.200]   started to not play me on back-to-backs.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.880]   So I was being very well taken care of by the organization.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.560]   I had a good genetic, I guess, code to, to help me to recover quick and not have bad
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.080]   injuries.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   And at the same time, I did my best to be very purposeful on every time I had the
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.760]   opportunity, every meal, every night, my schedule and all that.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.600]   So again, multiple factors.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.920]   And what did some of those things you were doing on your own for, for those of us who,
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.880]   who aren't going to fly someone from Spain in to live with us once a week, what kinds
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.400]   of changes did you make to sleep, to food or diet or exercise?
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.920]   No, nothing too surprising.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:52.240]   Things that you heard about a million times, cut down on sugars, white flour, all
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.280]   the stuff that you could see in a package that you don't know where it came from.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.360]   I tried to avoid it.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:04.000]   I made foods that your great grandfather would know what it is a hundred years ago.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.560]   Then sleeping and resting every opportunity I had, because before, even though I told
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:16.680]   you, I didn't go out, again, finished, arrived home at 11, 12, and I would watch a
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.400]   movie and hang out with my wife or do something and then didn't really give
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.280]   importance to sleep.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.880]   And then I started to read about it and realize that, that, that was the time where
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:36.160]   your muscles, your head, your immune system and everything kind of regroup and your
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.480]   body recovers quicker if you sleep well and all that.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.120]   So sleep, well, food, I mentioned then sometimes with my physio, we came home after
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:51.240]   a game and we would work on relaxing some of the muscle groups that worked the most
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.120]   where it was tight.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   The day after we would go and do a mobility routine, stretching.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.440]   So it was a lot of work, but it was definitely worth it.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.800]   Both the, the, the mental and physical investment.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.560]   Did you ever get into any kind of breathing mindfulness kind of training in that
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:10.960]   regard?
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.400]   Yes.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   And that also had a role.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:22.200]   I think it was in 2015 when I was starting to consider the possibility of retiring
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.360]   because I was not in a great spot and meditation with a, with a teacher here in
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:35.040]   San Antonio really helped me to, to again, well, we talked before, be less demanding
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   and less obsessed with the game and just value other things, the present moment and
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.360]   all that.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:47.680]   So in 2015, I started meditating and, and it had a huge impact on me that first
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:56.120]   year to, to enjoy a loss, to, to be present and valuing that at 38, I was still
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.160]   playing in the NBA in a place where I wanted to be in a city where I wanted to be
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.560]   with teammates that I wanted to be with.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.880]   And that changed the perspective of just the finish goal, right?
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.200]   If I win the last game, I want a championship meant satisfaction.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.560]   If I didn't have, he felt like, well, frustration.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.920]   That, that made a big impact on me.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.560]   How, how common were some of these techniques in the NBA at the time?
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.760]   And were they things that you found valuable and shared with people on the team,
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.080]   at least within your locker room?
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.000]   No, it was, it was not very common back then.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.000]   Now, now I think it is, it's something that is more talked about.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.080]   I was kind of not saying hiding it, but I didn't really know.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.720]   I thought of I'm skeptical in every aspect of my life, usually, but all of a
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.800]   sudden I started reading one, two, three of the guys that I listened to a lot or
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:24:00.040]   read, and then I remember I got, actually pop gave me a waking up by, by Sam Harris.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:06.080]   And when I saw this guy that I admire, that I, that I know is a scientist and
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:12.720]   went through a lot of stuff and tested things and he was the way he put it out
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.600]   there, I said, no, I, this is for me too.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.040]   So before I thought it was more of a, you know, woo thing.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:26.120]   And then I started to, to appreciate it and practice it.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.920]   And I saw great benefit.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.080]   And I feel like it's in the recent past become a big thing.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.280]   I met, I met someone a few weeks ago who was a mindfulness coach to
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.120]   some European football leagues on Byron Munich, the team.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.280]   He was surprised that that was not a thing anyone had really ever heard
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.960]   of when he went and talked to them.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.880]   And so it's still early days, but it sounds like it had a huge
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.720]   impact on your last few years.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.920]   And I think it's pretty valuable that people are starting to wake up to it.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.040]   And, and I think it works outside of professional sports.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.680]   I find that I'm more productive on days that I get a good night's sleep and
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.400]   that I feel good about what I ate.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.440]   And it sometimes seems counterintuitive.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.760]   You're like, oh, if I, if I sleep less, I have more time to work.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.440]   And it's like, no, no.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.520]   If you sleep more, your work is better.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.760]   Definitely.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.480]   I, I couldn't agree more.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:21.040]   After the, after reading Matthew Walker's book about why we sleep, I think it's
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:27.320]   called also my perspective changed even more, I knew what was starting to be
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   valuable, but when he put all the data, all the studies in it, it has nothing to
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.360]   do, well, it has to do with athletes, but it has to do also with programmers or
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:46.560]   lawyers or anybody that wants to be proactive and energetic and healthy and
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.800]   feeling good about themselves.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.440]   So the value of sleep is super, super important and many times
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.360]   underestimated still to this day.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.320]   So I try to advocate for that too.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:03.880]   Whenever I talk to younger generations or, or even companies, because I, for
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:09.600]   example, the CEO of any company, I don't want the CEO of any company to do all
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.320]   night, wake working.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.160]   I want them to be asleep and rested and creative for the day after and be in a
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.400]   good mood to treat their employees well.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   So no, it's not about only athletes.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.080]   It's about anybody around.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.960]   They got to eat well, they got to do exercise and they got to sleep.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.520]   How, and so now you went from playing 82 games, practices, playoffs.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.400]   I think every year you were at the Spurs.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.360]   So now, now you're kind of retired.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.880]   You got time on your hands.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.080]   I know you're doing some work now with the Spurs, but how
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.120]   do you spend your time now?
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.680]   Well, I, I do work out a lot.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.440]   I still do.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.680]   I play tennis.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.760]   I do two things that I couldn't do before.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.640]   I don't play basketball at all, zero basketball in the last three and a half
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.440]   years, but I ride the bike three times a week, play tennis twice, then I'm a father
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.960]   of three boys and that's a lot of work always, I start, I'm starting to get
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:18.360]   slowly into BC, the Spurs also hire me this year to do some consulting.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.040]   So I'm spending time with them.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.120]   So I keep plenty busy, man.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.080]   I, I love what I do.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.920]   I love my flexibility of time.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:32.520]   I like my peace of mind being present for my family and traveling with them.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.800]   I couldn't be in a, in a better spot.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.200]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.160]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.080]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.280]   many manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.520]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.920]   37,000.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.440]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.800]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.280]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.360]   reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.040]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.720]   why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens, and I am excited to be
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.320]   partnering with them for this episode.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.360]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I've
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.760]   kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.760]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.040]   It tastes so good when it's cold and I head to my office feeling focused and
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.560]   energized for the day, which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.760]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, and superfoods
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.280]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.400]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.

[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.840]   Now you're not a, an NBA player and you're just, just a dad doing some side
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.040]   jobs and enjoying time with the family.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.640]   You mentioned you're biking, you mentioned you're playing tennis.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.600]   What advice to anyone listening here that's similarly in their late thirties,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.600]   early forties, couple of kids trying to get in shape.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.760]   What have you learned about exercise and fitness, your career?
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.000]   Obviously you have a very gifted set of genetics, but what, what would people
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.400]   take home as, as ways to kind of really keep exercise and fitness in their routine?
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.720]   That you have to do it, that it doesn't only help your body, your muscles, your
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:58.800]   bones, but your head too, your, your head needs a healthy, active body.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:05.200]   So some people may not start because they think they can ride 30 miles or they can
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.360]   run for 10 K or, or swim a bunch of laps.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.200]   But you start with a step and, and there's a million things nowadays you can do.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.120]   There's, there are workouts online for anybody.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.400]   Now with a, with a band attached to a door, you can do a full workout.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.240]   You can buy one kettlebell and do as many swings as you want.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.840]   It's a matter of convincing yourself and ideally doing it with somebody else that
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.400]   can, you can challenge yourself and you can have some accountability.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:44.640]   But before you used to have a membership, you needed a membership to a, to a gym or
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.920]   you needed a bike or going somewhere or having a coach.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.840]   Now you can do it with a band and it's, there are so many options and it's, it's
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.000]   going to affect your mood.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.400]   It's going to affect your health.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.200]   So yeah, there are no excuses.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.800]   You just got to convince yourself that you got to do it.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.600]   And do you ever have days where you wake up and you're like, I just don't want to
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.640]   do it, uh, today, I'm just not going to take that bike ride.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.960]   Or, or if you have that feeling, how do you end up on the bike?
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.680]   I tell you this story because I loved it.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.840]   My first year and a half or two years, I was lifting too.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   Now I'm not lifting.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:26.560]   I got to go back to it, but I, I was going two or three times a week to the, to the
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.920]   spurs to, to lift when the guys were gone, I was going in and having a, uh, doing my
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.040]   routine and I was enjoying it.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.120]   I was, I was fine.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:42.840]   But this one day I get to the facility, I look at the weights, I say, you know what?
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.120]   I don't feel like it today.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.760]   I turned around, I went back home and I felt like a million bucks.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.840]   Nobody, nobody tells me to do it.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.440]   I just doing it because I want.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.320]   And if I don't, I don't do it.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.880]   And the same with the bike.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.200]   The thing is that there are way more times that I want to do it, that I enjoy, you
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.000]   know, being outdoors and riding on the creeks with trees.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.400]   And I just love also the, the, the feeling that you get once you're done.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:18.840]   And so it's, it is again, I'm in a very privileged situation and I do it because I
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.200]   love it.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.360]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.320]   I've got a Peloton.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.640]   And so I started biking and I was one of those crazy people that had never actually
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.000]   biked outside really.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.760]   I mean, obviously I've ridden a bicycle, but finally we got bikes and we got a seat
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.040]   for the, our daughter.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.640]   And I was like, wow, this is great.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.880]   Now I'm like getting back into biking outside.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.440]   It's fun.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.960]   And, and I find that when your exercise is something fun to do with someone, I can't
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.680]   remember, I listened to a podcast and someone said they started exercising with their
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.360]   partner and I'd always thought of that, but my wife and I started running together.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.480]   And then we were like, oh, that's fun.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.320]   Like the more you can make your exercise fun, I think the easier it is to get out and
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:53.680]   do it.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.600]   And accountability is huge.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.200]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.040]   And people are coming with great ideas.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.720]   They are, they are gamifying the, the exercise.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.120]   They're giving you tools.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.760]   They're going, they're making, making it easy to do it.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:16.760]   So there are a bunch of startups and ideas and machines and, and kettlebells and bands
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.320]   that can help multiple group muscles and cardio and all that.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.280]   So it's, it's great.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.760]   You mentioned startups.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.680]   I know you also mentioned you're, you're getting involved with VC.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.480]   What has it been like to transition from someone focused on one complete industry so
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.800]   much to, to dive deep into a totally different industry where I'm sure you probably now
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.840]   look up to investors and founders and say, oh, I got a lot to learn.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.040]   And they all look up to you and say, oh my gosh, legendary basketball player.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.600]   What's it, what's it like entering a totally different industry in this part of
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.080]   your career?
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.840]   I always admired that industry.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:59.160]   I, I love tech and I try to, to dig into new ideas, software, hardware, try to learn,
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:06.320]   try to stay current and, and informed, but now with a little more time and some people
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.080]   that I met, they, they got me closer to it.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.560]   And I, I find it fascinating.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:18.920]   I'm so clueless about all this world that it is very exciting to go and listen to these
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.000]   people and how they came up with the idea, what they are trying to do, accomplish, how
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.720]   they set up the mission, how they recruit the team.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.120]   So I'm just at this point trying to be a fly in the wall, trying to learn, trying to
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.240]   figure it out and be next to very smart people that know what they're doing, that they
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.320]   have done it before.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.840]   So I'm not in a rush to do anything.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.440]   I don't, I don't, I'm not in it for, for the money.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.640]   I just like the thrill, the, the, the opportunities that these startups are giving
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.760]   us to make our lives better or the environment better.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.440]   So I I'm there to, to learn because I was always, was curious about it.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:05.160]   And at the same time, I also was able to build the capital and have the luxury to put
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.560]   just a little bit, little part of it and try to contribute and hopefully get a good
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.560]   return on the investment.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.720]   But it's been very exciting to, to be part of the one, some of those meetings.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:21.160]   And they also, I also learned that they want to know my side of the story, how I was
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:27.800]   part of teams and organizations and the examples of leadership or going through tough
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   times or resiliency and all that.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.920]   So I guess we are both learning.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.680]   I'm jealous of the stats you have, though.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.120]   I was thinking about how there's a lot of commonalities between running a company,
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.320]   you're working on a team, you're all trying to compete with other companies.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:48.840]   And then I was like, man, it must be both terrifying and wonderful to know that there
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.920]   are just stats that help you understand how you're doing and you can compare yourself
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.880]   against other people.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.160]   Now you're experiencing a world outside of stats.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.000]   It's like, oh, how am I doing now?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.560]   I have to rely on feedback and conversations and feel myself worth more than I can just
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.200]   say, oh, well, obviously I put up this many points last night.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:06.920]   I did a good job.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.320]   It is a completely different world.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:16.120]   That's why I'm going with very humble objectives, just to listen to stories, to, to
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:22.760]   to try to contribute to causes and things that I care about, that I'm interested in.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:31.000]   So again, I take it as a completely learning experience and trying at the same time to
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.320]   contribute to causes that I care about or values that I care about.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:42.040]   So I'm putting my intention in those aspects.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.160]   Yeah, and you mentioned earlier your father was in basketball.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.360]   I mentioned the stats of that, making you more likely to be in there.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.680]   Do you think basketball will play a big role in in your time going forward?
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.200]   I know you're working a little with the Spurs, but you haven't touched a basketball
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:58.840]   in three years.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.000]   The other day I grabbed it.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.760]   I wanted to shoot 10 shots to see how it felt.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.800]   I couldn't make one zero for 10 threes.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.680]   And it was unbelievable muscle memories.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.160]   Incredible.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:17.240]   It's been three years and I dedicated basically 30 years of my life to shooting hooks and
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.600]   I couldn't make one.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.040]   So it's amazing.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.840]   Amazing.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.880]   But at the same time, I, with all my experiences, background, where I came from the
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:33.160]   languages that I played in many places in Italy, in Argentina, Olympics, World Cups
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.120]   and all that, you know, gave me some insider information that is still very valuable.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.760]   And I wanted to share, I wanted to talk to the younger generations to tell them that
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:49.800]   the mistakes I made, the things that really worked for me, what I wish I knew earlier
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.760]   as we talked before.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:57.480]   So in some way, I'm trying to contribute to the organization in that aspect.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.160]   The thing is that I'm still not ready to go full time.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:07.880]   I, I don't want to lose my freedom to, to go to Argentina, for example, now in December
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.560]   and January that it's summer there.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:16.120]   I don't want to lose the opportunity to go spring break with the kids in March because
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.280]   they have a week off their school.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.680]   So I'm starting to go back and be connected to the game.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.280]   I'm still not that committed to be like all in.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.840]   And I don't even know if it's ever going to happen.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.080]   We'll see when my kids are older.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.840]   But at this point, I, again, I'm loving where my position, my privilege.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.960]   We've talked a lot on the show about financial independence.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.200]   And part of that is, is to buy the time and be able to spend time doing what you want,
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.160]   which you're clearly doing.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.800]   What's been the greatest challenge you've had since leaving basketball?
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.360]   I really didn't have any challenges.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.360]   I, I, I've been really enjoying it.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:06.600]   I thought I was going to be a little antsy to, to feel that adrenaline rush, the, the
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.720]   pressure and the responsibility.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.680]   But I really don't.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.480]   Actually, I went through it for a long time.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.400]   I, I had to, to live with that pressure, with that responsibility.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.640]   And, and I'm not seeking it.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.520]   I'm just, again, loving my peace of mind.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.960]   So I do miss a little bit the, the locker room, the camaraderie, the dinners after the
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:37.880]   game where we just hang out and talk about stuff and, or preparing together for a, one
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.520]   of those games.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.800]   But again, I, I'm having a great life.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:49.400]   I, I'm enjoying the time with my family and going ride the bike for 20, 30 miles in the
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.040]   outdoors.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:56.760]   So I really didn't face the challenges that I was afraid I was going to live, but maybe
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:02.040]   also that I, it took me a while to, the last three years of my career, I was kind of preparing
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.240]   for this time.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:08.360]   So I did a lot of things to be sure that I was going to be in a good spot.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.640]   And I have a great family.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.120]   My wife is great, very patient with me too.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.360]   So I, I really, I didn't face any challenges so far.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:22.040]   Was there anything you did with your family and your relationship during what I can only
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.960]   imagine was a very busy season to keep that, that relationship strong with your family?
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:33.080]   I know lots of people, whether you're starting a company or playing sports, it's hard.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.640]   You're away a lot and you put a lot of weight on, on your spouse's shoulders.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   What, what let you get through that?
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.880]   It sounds like you're in a great spot right now after a lot of years.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.680]   A lot of years.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:50.280]   And I'm telling you, she, she's been with me since my last year in Italy.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.600]   So she went through all my career in the NBA and I don't know, I guess I got lucky with
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.880]   her that she was always very patient and all my craziness and that she took all the summers
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.200]   off.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:08.120]   Like the summers where I was supposed to spend time with, with her and my family, many times,
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.280]   I just went to play workups and Olympic games.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:17.800]   And it was not an easy time for her, but I guess she understood it, how I felt and how
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.680]   important it was for me.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.920]   The kids were too little, so they didn't really know what was happening.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:29.080]   But now we are in a place where we have that flexibility that she's more of the priority.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.760]   So the priority on where she wants to go and what she wants to do.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.400]   And I try to help her a lot with the kids and be present.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.840]   So she's, she's enjoying that part too.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.480]   But I guess we were lucky to find each other.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:49.240]   Yeah, I feel similarly, and I've gone through a lot of crazy startup stuff and, and
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.920]   finding someone to go through that with you.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.000]   I assume that was helpful along the way when you're stressed out about losing and all these
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.720]   things.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.440]   Well, that was huge because as I told you, I was very tough on myself.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:09.320]   So many times, especially earlier, I brought that frustration home too.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:15.480]   And I, I didn't want to talk about the game and I was moody, but then slowly we started
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.600]   to, to figure it out each other saying, okay, she's not going to mention even the game that
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.320]   just finished.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.920]   And I'm going to leave that game that just finished in the locker room.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:33.560]   And then after big losses or huge wins, we were going to just hang out, enjoy the kids
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.280]   or do things that I had no connection to my job.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.920]   And we found a great chemistry there.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:50.120]   So I was never, I never brought basketball at home for my wife, parents, friends, whenever
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.240]   somebody came to San Antonio to hang out with me and, you know, spend quality time.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:00.440]   It was just about us, what was happening in the world or whatever, but no basketball.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.600]   Basketball was from the locker room and in, never out.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.440]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.800]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.680]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.200]   They make performance apparel.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.960]   That's incredibly versatile.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.120]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.880]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.720]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.280]   Seriously.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.040]   I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing right now, unless
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.840]   you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.680]   And it's not just for men.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.480]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.040]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.600]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.000]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether it's running, training
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.960]   or yoga.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.280]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their MetaPants can even work for
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:56.920]   a night out.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.440]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.040]   for you.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.840]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.080]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.720]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.360]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:59.640]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic mold
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.480]   commonly found in plants.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.360]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:12.040]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:16.600]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.400]   for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:26.520]   metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.640]   things to drink.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.480]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits of
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:36.360]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more and then be happy that
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.680]   Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:45.080]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free US
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.280]   shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:54.200]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples

[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.160]   What about with your kids?
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:32.840]   I know you grew up with a family of basketball players and you obviously grew up to be quite
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.480]   successful.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.880]   Are your kids learning to play basketball yet?
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.920]   They are.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.720]   They are learning and they love it and they try to watch everything.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.560]   So now I'm watching more.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:47.160]   We play a little fantasy game with other families and they absolutely love it.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.360]   And now I'm way more relaxed.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.280]   Now I don't care about talking about basketball.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.520]   I mean, I'm happy to do.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.600]   So when they do ask questions on what used to happen back then, how I was, you know,
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.480]   ex-players, then we do talk.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:08.200]   But during my years of complete obsession, basketball was not mentioned at home.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:08.840]   Wow.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   Yeah, I struggle with that because my wife and I work at the same company.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:17.160]   So talking about work at home is something that on one hand, we're fortunate that we've
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:17.640]   usually...
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.200]   I never want to come home and say, "Oh, guess what's happening at work?"
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.160]   Because she already knows.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.480]   So I guess maybe that was my hack, was if you want to avoid talking about work at home,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.560]   if you both work at the same place, you can kind of all be on the same page all the time.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.680]   But that's a good point.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   But no, in my case, everybody was...
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.800]   Nobody's in the locker room.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:39.000]   Nobody knows what the coach said or what the instructions were.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.720]   So when somebody was criticizing that somebody didn't pass it to who or that your defense
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.520]   was not good or they didn't know what was happening indoors, we did and we talked about
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.920]   it and we watched videos and we analyzed and we were...
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.240]   Oh, it was too much.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:59.800]   So whenever I got home, I needed to be able to not think that much.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.840]   Well, that's good that you could get on the same page.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:07.800]   So while we've talked a lot about basketball in your career, that wasn't what brought us
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.360]   together.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:14.680]   And I know we've connected through you listening to some podcasts that I was on with Kevin
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.040]   Rose, and we've shared some conversations about money and travel.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:24.280]   So I want to start off with something I found on Twitter that in 2011, you said this was
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.320]   the year you became a minivan dad and that you were proud of it.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.760]   And since technically, I think this is a finance podcast, at least a little bit.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.520]   Athletes so often go bankrupt, they spend lavishly.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:41.080]   You seem to have the smallest ego of any athlete I've heard talk.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:46.120]   How did you end up down this different path where I can't imagine that the hottest car
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.680]   for an NBA athlete in 2011 was a minivan?
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.360]   Yeah, it wasn't.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.080]   It really wasn't.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:57.000]   I thought it was the best we could get for having twins.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.520]   We had twins.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.360]   We had a bunch of stuff to put in there.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.160]   We have a dog.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:06.200]   And after doing some research, I mean, the van is the way to go.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.760]   And it took me a while to convince my wife.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.200]   My wife didn't want anything to do with it.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.280]   And I said, I think you're going to love it.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.200]   And we are going to be so comfortable.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.520]   And the kids were too little to leave them in school.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.920]   So I did it.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.000]   And we were very happy about it.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.200]   We still are, actually.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:24.760]   We still are.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.120]   You know, we are 10 years later.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   We're still our minivan dads.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.440]   She drives it more than me now.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.160]   But I remember one time we were playing.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.400]   I don't remember where he was back then, but I was shooting free throws.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.600]   And Tyson Chandler comes to me and says, so you have a minivan too?
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.840]   We are two in the NBA now.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.040]   I say, no, we are three.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.680]   I got a friend in Brooklyn that has one too.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.520]   So we were three players probably in the NBA driving minivans.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.200]   So very small minority.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:59.480]   Not just minivans, but watches and all kinds of things to spend money on.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.160]   Do you think it was growing up internationally?
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.920]   Or what do you think helped you not go down the path so many athletes go down
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.280]   when they make money and end up spending it all so quickly?
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:15.720]   I never attached my self-esteem to a possession.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:20.200]   So that would be how to summarize it.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:27.880]   The car I drove or the clothes I wore or jewelry never meant anything for me.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:33.400]   So yeah, I never felt like I had to show that I was doing good.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.440]   That what I did was showing it.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.080]   That I was playing for the team I wanted to play.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.240]   We were winning championships.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.600]   I let that do the talking.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.800]   So I never felt like I had to show where I was.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.480]   I guess the ego was part of it too.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   I never had a strong one and I never wanted to or cared about living lavishly.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.840]   Of course, I have a great house.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.600]   I played in the NBA for many years.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.960]   That helped me make a lot of money and I could live well.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:14.520]   But I never felt like I needed to dress flashy or drive half a million dollar car.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.800]   So it was not my thing.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:21.400]   Is there a thing in life that you love that you're willing to upgrade and enjoy
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.080]   outside of the stuff that you just kind of live in a more standard way?
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:29.400]   Well, I like living in a very nice house.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   So if I have to splurge, I'll do it on that.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.600]   I like to travel.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:41.400]   So when we travel, we don't go to the most economic places.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:45.880]   I mean, we choose the place where we're going to go and we go there.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:51.560]   And we believe that those moments with the family or having a great trip and
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   traveling business, it is a priority because it enhances how much we enjoy the experience.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.600]   And we do it.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:09.080]   But then again, I don't need to drive my kids to school in a car that costs $300,000 or $500,000.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:15.560]   For me, it doesn't add anything to my way of living.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.920]   I mean, you say that travel is the place that you'll spend on.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:24.760]   But I also happen to know from our conversations that you dabble a little bit in the game of
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.200]   credit card points and miles.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.280]   So how did you get into that?
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.440]   We all have credit cards.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:36.920]   And then I started to get those that you can add more points and then use it for traveling
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.720]   and business.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.600]   So I guess I listened to somebody talking about it.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:45.080]   And I knew I had a million points with my credit card.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.440]   And I was not using it.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:54.600]   So all of a sudden, I searched for ways to travel and or upgrade tickets.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.920]   And I get to this website.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.880]   I think it is the points guy or something like that.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:05.560]   And I started to dig in and get it going in the rabbit hole and reading.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.480]   I said, oh, my God, look at this.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.760]   This is a word that I had no idea about.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:16.680]   So I started to get curious and get different cards for different points.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:22.920]   So currently, I have millions of points that I'm not really using it.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.960]   I used them last year.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.520]   For example, we are five and we traveled to Argentina.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.160]   We flew in business and I used them with miles.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.120]   And it was learning from you, Chris.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.960]   A great deal.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.640]   I got a good deal.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.000]   But overall, I don't use them.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.360]   So I'm good at crewing.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.240]   I'm not used.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.240]   I'm not good using them yet.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.520]   So working on that.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:52.040]   But again, wherever we decide to go next summer, it's not going to depend on where I get the
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.040]   best deal, where we want to go.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.360]   We'll see with my wife and we'll decide, OK, we want to do a safari in Africa or we want
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:03.400]   to do go to Costa Rica or Fiji, whatever, whatever we decide we're going to do.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.000]   That's the priority.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.880]   Then if I get the points, if I get the perks of the million points that I have, great.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.440]   We'll do it.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.960]   If not, we'll just go there and use the points at a different time.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.880]   But I, you know, since I am spending a lot of money in credit cards every year, I thought,
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.480]   OK, let's accumulate these points if they are there to grab.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:28.440]   And I tried to optimize my spending.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.240]   And yeah, true.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.160]   I learned a lot from you, Chris.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.920]   And how many cards are you using now?
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.240]   Five.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:35.880]   Are you proud of me?
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.160]   I was going to go for three.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.720]   So five.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.800]   No, I got five.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:45.000]   One business one, Amex, Visa, another Amex.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.880]   And the fifth one is, I know I just got it from my wife, another one.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.200]   So my wife, my wife is pissed at you.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:56.600]   She doesn't like you because I kept telling her, well, you go to the supermarket, use
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.080]   this one.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.960]   And she used the other one and gets yelled at.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:05.880]   But it's just a way of optimizing and trying to accumulate more points.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.400]   But we are not crazy about it.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.560]   The way it all changes is you go on some really, really expensive trip.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.560]   Let's say you decide we're flying on Emirates.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.720]   We have our suites on the plane.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:21.640]   And then you're drinking Dom and you're like, hey, this was 100% free.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.760]   Zero dollars.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.080]   That moment is when the switch flipped.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.280]   I heard those stories and I'm ready to test them.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.880]   The thing is that we are just not going that far nowadays.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.920]   We're going to Argentina.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.960]   We don't have those flights.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:40.600]   And we are going to mainly near here.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.160]   The kids are still kind of young.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.320]   So but soon, soon we are going to start following your advice.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.640]   Where are places you want to go that are on your list for when maybe the world opens up?
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.560]   The immediate one is Safari in Africa.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.480]   We do want to take the kids.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.280]   My wife wanted to go there for four years.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:05.240]   And that's something that is in the immediate bucket list.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   Then Italy, Spain.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.200]   There are two places that we spent some time in.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.240]   We actually lived in Italy for four years.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.120]   We want to go back.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.320]   We believe that the kids need to be a little older.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.000]   They get more bored in there.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.280]   There's not too much to do.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.000]   But soon we'll go back because I miss it.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.960]   And I haven't been back in Italy in 15 years.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.640]   So those are the two immediate ones.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.480]   Then, of course, Australia and New Zealand are coming soon.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:39.160]   The problem is that the time of the weather, December and January, we want to be in Argentina.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.000]   It's when we enjoy the summer with our friends and family.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.480]   So eventually, Australia and New Zealand are coming.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:53.800]   I also remember, I think it's tough to get from South America to Africa and to Australia and New Zealand.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.040]   I don't know if there are flights now, but there used to be.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.520]   The only way to get from Argentina to Africa was to go up to Europe or the US.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.120]   Well, yes.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.440]   Whenever we go to Africa, it's going to be from here.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:09.400]   But I took a flight that I don't think they do it anymore.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.000]   Or maybe Air New Zealand does it.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.160]   But it goes under.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:21.480]   So from Argentina to Auckland, there's a direct flight, 17-hour flight,
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.600]   that goes through the Southern Pole.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.120]   It's pretty cool.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:32.040]   I've done it, actually, with the Argentinians in 1997 to play a U21 World Cup.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.840]   And we were fired up to do that.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.360]   And a couple of years ago, New Zealand was starting to do it.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.840]   Now, with all this, probably they're not.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.920]   But no, probably not 100%.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:43.320]   They're not.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:49.560]   So most of the trips are starting from Texas.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.280]   Okay.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.880]   And what kind of travel are you?
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.320]   I heard somewhere on the internet that you have a no-room-service rule.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.680]   But what's your style of travel when you get to a new place?
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:02.760]   No, the no-room-service was when I was playing.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:08.440]   Most of my teammates just got to a city and stayed inside
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.280]   from the minute they got there to the minute they left.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.600]   They went just to a place and I couldn't take that.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.400]   I'm not American.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.880]   I didn't know any of the cities.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.680]   I got drafted and I didn't know what San Antonio was.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.320]   Where was it?
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.200]   What Texas was?
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.920]   I had no clue.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:27.640]   So by the time I got here, I said, "No, I want to see these cities.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.600]   I want to walk the city.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.360]   I want to see what they are about."
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:38.760]   And of course, I had to combine that with the performance part that I wanted to do good.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:43.880]   So whenever there was an opportunity, I went out and I walked and I visited places
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.160]   and I ate at restaurants.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:52.280]   Most of the times, whenever an Argentinian gets to the league,
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.960]   they call me for like, "Where can I go in Milwaukee?"
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.600]   So I'll go to my list and text them.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:04.280]   Anything on your list that are just standouts across the country that people should check out?
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.560]   Well, a lot of people are not excited when they go to Oklahoma City, for example.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.520]   But probably my favorite steakhouse is in Oklahoma City.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.400]   So...
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.200]   Which one?
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.880]   And it's called Red.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.320]   And you go there and you order the skirt steak with truffle risotto.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.520]   It's like I had to do.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.920]   So it's something that I did.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.120]   I've done the last 10 years that I went to.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.320]   Okay, see, I went to that restaurant and I ate that dish because it's outstanding.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.280]   And we did it with my crew, right?
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:41.240]   We had teammates that we were going and we all enjoyed that dish.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.280]   But I had little things in almost every city.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.880]   There are some cities that you play...
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.800]   The cities on the East, you go only one time a year.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.760]   And many times it's in a back-to-back or it's in January.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.320]   And in Toronto, it's minus 20 degrees.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.000]   So you don't get to do much.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.840]   But the other cities that I played playoffs or that I've been so many times,
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.720]   then you start to learn places to go.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.400]   What about Argentina?
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.880]   You probably know it better than most.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.000]   If anyone's listening, heading to Argentina, any must-do's?
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.040]   Many, many must-do's.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.440]   The only problem with us is that we are a big country too.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.000]   And people think that they'll go to Argentina and get it done in a couple of days.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.200]   And it's big.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.160]   So you got in the Northeast, the amazing Iguazu waterfalls.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.560]   Something incredible that everybody should witness.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.000]   But bring a change of clothes.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.080]   So my experience in Iguazu was I was completely head-to-toe drenched.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.160]   Not a single dry spot.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.480]   Yes, I agree.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.680]   Very humid.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.880]   It's the jungle.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.800]   But it's worth witnessing.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:53.480]   In the South, we got the glaciers that are just outstanding too.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.240]   Perito Moreno Glacier.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.760]   And it's a wonderful national park.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.640]   I love it too.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.840]   I gotta go back actually.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.920]   Then on the Southeast, you got whale watching that is so top-notch.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.480]   That is amazing in Puerto Madryn.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.200]   Also penguins.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:19.720]   And you can see the orcas actually getting out of the water to try to get a sea lion.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.960]   It's the only place it happens in the world.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.640]   I haven't witnessed it yet.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.480]   The times I went, it didn't happen.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.600]   You gotta be lucky.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.440]   But you see the orcas many times.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.880]   Wine country.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.320]   Buenos Aires is amazing.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.600]   Swamps.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.520]   I could be talking about Argentina all day.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.600]   This is a wonderful country that everybody should spend some time going to.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.840]   We need Manu's Argentina travel show.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.440]   It could be your next YouTube adventure.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.720]   That could be.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.200]   That could be.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.560]   Good idea, Chris.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.440]   Okay, I have one last travel question, which is I always have seen that teams are now all
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.400]   chartering flights.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.640]   And sometimes you get a flight where every seat is a business class seat.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.840]   Have you been on a flight where it wasn't all business?
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.920]   And if so, how do you decide who on the team gets to sit up front and who sits in the back?
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.800]   Well, we are so spoiled.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.000]   We got charters.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.200]   So they actually have room for, I think, 14 players.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.560]   And now there are more than 14 players in teams.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.280]   So they send a couple to the back.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.880]   But they are planes that are especially conditioned for taller players.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:34.120]   So they have a few that face each other for guys that want to play cards, write, type,
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.760]   or whatever they have facing each other.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.880]   Then they have other ones that sleep the whole time.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.320]   So yeah, those are not flights that you can choose, that you can accrue miles.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.160]   You just jump in and you go wherever they tell you to go.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.040]   The coaches have their own stuff, too, where they watch the videos.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:59.080]   They debate the next steps and plan ahead and analyze games after they happen.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.840]   And in the way back, they have all the other stuff.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.120]   So again, very, very spoiled for travel that the NBA players are.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.280]   Any travel or life hacks to leave us with?
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:18.680]   Things you do unique in your routine that someone here might want to give a try in their life?
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:24.760]   Well, for money, I just listened to the episode with your boss.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.480]   It's basically what I've been reading about the last few years.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.080]   And it's so well said that I'm not going to repeat it.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.280]   Go back and listen to him.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.440]   That's an episode with Andy Radcliffe about investing.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:42.120]   When I got here, I never had any money, basically.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.480]   I never invested.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.600]   So I had no idea.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.400]   And I was being overcharged.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:53.560]   I was being sold funds owned by the same bank of the guy that proposed them.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.880]   And I was paying super high fees for many years.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:05.240]   And then I started to read about how to optimize all that and choose or invest
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:10.920]   in index funds with low costs that will mimic S&P 500 and loss harvesting.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.480]   So that was something I learned.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:20.520]   And also the value of fiduciary duties when you have a financial advisor.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.120]   I had no idea it existed.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:22.920]   Nobody told me.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.920]   It was not mentioned.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.240]   And for many of the guys that came from Europe, it's automatic.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.120]   I think in Europe, either most or all have something like that.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.280]   Somebody will correct them, correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.160]   But when you come to the States, it's different.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:45.640]   And sometimes the broker will sell you the funds that benefit him, not you as an investor.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.320]   And that's something I had no idea.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:52.440]   So for many years, I kind of suffered between...
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:57.480]   Not really suffered, but I saw that happening until I figured it out.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.720]   Reading a couple of the books and listening to guys like Andy.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:06.600]   The value of sleep is also something that I've been trying to figure out for years.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:12.760]   The NBA doesn't propitiate good sleep patterns because of the time that the games are played,
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.920]   the traveling and all that.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.800]   And I tried a bunch of gadgets.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.720]   First, it was one that attached to the pillow.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.280]   Then it was a Fitbit.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.520]   Then finally, I found a sweet spot with the Oura ring that I think gets the best.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.020]   There you go.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.840]   That's a bad finger to show.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.340]   I know.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.860]   I realized that as I held it up.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.980]   But it gave me very good feedback.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:46.540]   And I think every NBA player, athlete, or person, actually, should wear.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:51.820]   And full disclosure, after wearing it for a year, I decided to invest because I think it's a
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.900]   fantastic product.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.740]   And I don't know.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:56.380]   I think that's...
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.500]   I mean, that's a lot.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.460]   That's about it.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.140]   Yeah, I think the combination of...
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:07.100]   For a health hack, the combination of workout, sleep, and nutrition is unbeatable.
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:07.740]   You'll be happy.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.780]   You'll be active.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.460]   You'll feel great about yourself.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.260]   You'll lose weight.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:16.540]   There is so much data out there that is amazing.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:21.900]   Once you get in there and you start digging, you'll improve yourself a lot.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.100]   Yeah, you mentioned books.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.140]   I know you love podcasts.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.100]   I know you love books.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.020]   Anything you're reading or listening to lately that you've enjoyed?
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.220]   Ryan Holiday is my advisor in everything.
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:32.780]   It's books.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.300]   And he has recommended me amazing stuff.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:44.620]   Great stories, very nurturing and learning a lot from his books or the ones that he's
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.420]   recommended me.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:52.060]   Here I got 304 that I read twice, that I also gave away.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.340]   Thinking Fast and Slow.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.140]   I don't know, from Danny Kahneman.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.740]   Awesome book.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.940]   Sapiens, also incredible.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.980]   Waking Up from Sam Harris.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:08.220]   And I don't have it there, but the one from Jared Diamond.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.980]   Guns, Germs, and Steel, I think it is.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:17.100]   Fascinating book, also about a similar topic to Sapiens.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.180]   Yeah, awesome.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.740]   I have not read that one, so I'll add it to the list.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.540]   Very, very good.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.580]   Highly recommended.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:27.020]   And money-wise, I liked Unshakeable from Tony Robbins.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.340]   And now I thought it was not only because of what he said.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   It's the people he interviewed and the people that talk in that book is the one where I
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:43.100]   understood about the fiduciary duties and how to invest more consciously.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:47.500]   Yeah, it's kind of the Wild West still in America when it comes to what a person is
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.860]   allowed to sell you.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:49.660]   I think it's crazy.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.260]   They can sell life insurance and pretend it's something else.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.620]   And yeah, it's wild.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.660]   So if you talk to anyone, ask if they're a fiduciary.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.740]   I was a victim for a few years.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:06.220]   So yeah, anytime I have the opportunity, I do tell the guys.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:12.140]   And I'm very happy that tools like Wealthfront are coming out, because on low fees, and
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:17.660]   adapts to what you want to do, and they harvest losses.
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.660]   And I think it's a great product.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.100]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:25.580]   All right, any last things to share or any place people should be finding you online?
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.900]   No, I'm very easy to find with this type of last name.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.060]   I'm very easy to find.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:35.500]   So I post here and there on Twitter and Instagram, not that much.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.820]   And they can find me at the sports games too.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:40.620]   Oh, yeah, I'll have to make it out there.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.300]   I was just in Austin, but San Antonio, I'll have to find you at a game.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.380]   Come join us, Chris.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.260]   You'll be welcomed.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.620]   We got a lot to talk about.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.900]   I need to learn more about how to use these points that I have.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:53.100]   Yeah, we'll have to do a session.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:53.900]   We'll just figure out.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.180]   You say, "Here's where I'm going."
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.620]   And we'll figure out how to make it work.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.220]   There you go.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:58.540]   Awesome.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:09:59.980]   Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.980]   Thank you for having me, Chris.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.620]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.540]   That was such a fun conversation.
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:10.140]   Though, I hope I get a chance one day to smooth things over with Manu's wife.

[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:15.420]   [Music]
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:19.900]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.740]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:28.300]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:32.620]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.900]   to save a dollar.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.060]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:43.180]   can build wealth, and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:48.460]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened to
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:53.820]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind, and it was so crazy
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.780]   to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.340]   plan.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.020]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.740]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:09.580]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.260]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.340]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:17.980]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.900]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
