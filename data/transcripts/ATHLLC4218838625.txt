[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.160]   Hello everyone.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.440]   And welcome to all the hacks, a show about upgrading your life, money, and
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.560]   travel all while spending less and saving more I'm Chris Hutchins, and it is so
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.160]   great to have you here for a really exciting episode.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.460]   If you've never been a fan of basketball, you might not recognize our guests, but I
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.320]   can assure you it's a conversation you won't want to miss.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.720]   And if you are a fan, then I'm sure you'll recognize NBA
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.240]   legend, Manu Ginobili.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   So by the end of this episode, you might refer to him as minivan driving, savvy
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.080]   investing, credit card points, obsessive NBA legend, Manu Ginobili.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.560]   Manu grew up playing basketball in Argentina and started his professional
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560]   career in 1995, playing in the Euro league.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.000]   In 99, the San Antonio Spurs picked Manu with the second to last
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880]   pick in the entire NBA draft.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.520]   But he wasn't offered a spot on the team right away.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.640]   So he kept playing in the Euro league, leading his team to win the 2001
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.360]   championship.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.320]   Finally, the next year he joined the Spurs roster and played his entire 16
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.280]   year NBA career with the team where they made the playoffs all 16 years, won an
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.280]   NBA championship four times, and Manu was named a two-time NBA all-star.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.480]   If that wasn't enough, he led team Argentina to an Olympic gold in 2002,
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.360]   which was, and still is, the only time Team USA has lost gold since 1988.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.720]   In fact, he is only one of two players in basketball history to win the Euro
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.480]   league, an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA championship.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.000]   He retired in 2018 at 40 years old after playing professional
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.920]   basketball for 23 years.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.120]   If that seems long, it's because the average NBA career is only four and a
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.880]   half years.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.680]   In fact, only 30 people in history have ever played into their forties.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.200]   In our conversation, we'll discuss how Manu pushed his mind and body to play on
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.560]   one of the world's biggest stages longer than everyone else.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.720]   This includes talking about training, fitness, diet, mindfulness practices, and
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.040]   more.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.080]   But that's not all we'll be talking about.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   There's another side of Manu that few people know about, and it's a big part of
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.400]   why I asked him to join me on all the hacks.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.240]   While there are so many professional athletes out there buying fancy cars and
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.960]   watches with big stacks of cash, Manu was pulling up to the AT&T center in his
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.120]   minivan and always making sure he used the right one of his five credit cards to
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.800]   rack up the most points he could.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   This is going to be a fantastic conversation, so let's jump in.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.600]   Manu, thanks for being here.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   Pleasure to be here, man.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720]   Yeah, so I'm just going to kick it off.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.200]   I read a New York Times article this morning, and it's from 2017.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.160]   And it said that you're two times more likely than the rest of the population to
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.800]   do the career your parents did.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.760]   And I know you grew up around basketball, and you played when you were young.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.920]   What was that like, and how much do you think that pushed you into the sport?
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.200]   Or do you think it was more internal desire?
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.960]   Well, my father was a big fan of the sport, was actually the president of Boys
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.320]   and Girls Club in my local city.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.640]   And I spent a lot, and I mean a lot of time shooting hoops and playing with
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.360]   whoever was at the gym.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.480]   I just got very lucky that my genetic code propitiated my basketball abilities
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   and that I had a strong desire to do well.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.240]   I really loved it from minute one.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.120]   And the combination of things sparked my career.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.280]   And do you think your younger self ever would have imagined the career you had?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.560]   Not in a million years.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.760]   I could visualize early that playing in Argentina at a high level, maybe with the
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.440]   national team, then later with maybe in Europe.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   But having had a career like this, winning multiple NBA championships and playing
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.080]   for 16 years in the NBA, that was impossible to forecast because there was not one
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.000]   Argentinian in history that played in the NBA when I was a kid.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.720]   So for us, it was unreachable, was something impossible.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.440]   And Michael Jordan was an alien that came from somewhere else to play hoops.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.400]   No, it was not part of the equation at all.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.720]   And has that changed now?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.880]   Have you changed the kind of aspirations of Argentinian basketball players now?
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.200]   Well, after so many years now, I think we are 15 players from Argentina that ended
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.400]   up playing in the NBA, some for a few games, some others for many.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.200]   So the NBA became that this world league, more than an American league, became more
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.840]   of a goal, something more reachable than what it was for me.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.680]   They've done a great job recruiting and drafting talent all over the world.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.720]   So basically every single country have one participant in the
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.680]   NBA in the last 10 years.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.720]   So it's, it changed a lot.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.960]   And your career didn't start in the NBA.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.720]   So I know you kind of had an atypical NBA career.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.200]   I think you were maybe 25 when you finally got to the NBA.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.920]   And like you said, first player from Argentina.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.920]   How did that path of being an outsider coming in late play into your role and
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.080]   how it changed over time?
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.440]   First of all, I wasn't ready at all at 20.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.520]   I was a late bloomer.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.360]   So at 18, I was not even close.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.800]   At 20, I wasn't ready either.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.040]   And I needed the, the extra work and the extra time in Europe to, to develop my
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.760]   game, to, to grow physically, mentally.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.480]   So even the day I got drafted at 22, I had zero expectations of being drafted.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:57.280]   And I think the Spurs either, they got me at number 57 and I didn't even know the
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.400]   draft was held that day.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.200]   So I was a late bloomer.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.080]   I had different types of expectations for my career.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.040]   And, but, but it just slowly happened.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.520]   And some goals, I reached some goals and then put the next one and then the next
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.680]   one, and all of a sudden I, all of a sudden, I felt I found myself at 25 playing for
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.840]   the, for the Spurs.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.760]   So the benefit of all that was that I saw basically everything.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.320]   I was a backup in Argentina as a small league.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.080]   Then I was playing in second division in Italy.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.600]   Then I moved to a very good team in Italy and I was supposed to be a six man there.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.400]   And the following year was more of a, the go-to guy in the championship team.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:55.320]   So I, I went through every stage to the NBA and made me, I think, value more, way
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.080]   more where I was at every stage.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.840]   So I, from, from day one here in the NBA, I never took anything for granted.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.200]   It was just a long way.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.520]   It took me to get here and I was going to use it as well as I could.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.720]   A lot of the people I know, whether they're in sports or entrepreneurs, they
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.000]   find that they have the skill and they're successful early on in the career.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.320]   And they're sometimes difficult to be coached.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.080]   You know, they think they have everything.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.600]   It seems like you appreciated the value of coaching and
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.480]   learning early on in your career.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.360]   Is that true?
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.000]   How did that evolve and how are your relationships with coaches?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.040]   I had very good relationships with every coach I had.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.920]   I'm not sure where that, where that comes from.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.240]   I wasn't, I've never been a rebellious type of guy.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.600]   I never challenged the authority or I just follow the rules and try to
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.280]   accommodate my skills to what I was being asked and try to bend those rules slowly.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.040]   The way, the way it happened with, with Bob, with, with the Spurs, but
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.920]   trying to, within the system, try to use my skills the best way I could.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.400]   But I both, well, actually everywhere I played in Italy, national team, NBA,
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.800]   or, or in Argentina, I still have good relationship with my coach.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.480]   And do you think the, the value of coaching applied equally
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.720]   throughout your career when you were just getting started, where
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.240]   you're kind of towards the end?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.920]   How did, how did that change over time?
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.760]   In the last 16 years, I had only one coach basically with the Spurs and
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.040]   he helped me grow as a man, as a player.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:39.760]   So I had the utmost respect for him, both on the court and off the court.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.840]   In the national team, we had only three coaches in the 20
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   years I played there, basically.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.040]   So that time allows you to, to create a bond, a connection and a way of
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.400]   communicating that goes beyond only words and, but times are great times.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   So you know exactly who you got next to you.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.040]   So I know I I'm part of a 1% or even less of players that, you know, had one coach
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.720]   for their career or so many, so sort of few amount of different type of
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.800]   personalities is just only a handful.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   So I've been very lucky in that regard.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.120]   And I, we had a great relationship with, with all of them.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.440]   I mean, you said very few people have that.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.240]   What do you think led to you being with the same team the whole
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.800]   time when I'm sure you had teammates coming and going the entire experience?
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.000]   Well, I think that I fit, I fit in this organization.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.160]   And I was very lucky to have RC and Bob that really liked me, really
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.360]   love having me around and what I gave the team both on and off the court,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.200]   because it depended on them, not only on me, then on my side, I, I just was
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:02.760]   happy here, so I was not willing to go look for something else somewhere
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.240]   because I didn't care about markets.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.040]   I didn't care about being on having more time on TV or something like that.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.480]   I was fine and we were winning and we had a great environment and we had a
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.960]   great family structure here in San Antonio.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.640]   So for most of my career, I didn't even consider going somewhere else.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.480]   There were a couple of times that maybe I entertained it because I didn't
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   know what was going to happen, but overall, I just been super lucky to have
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.840]   been part of this, this incredible organization and for so many years
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.520]   sharing teams with the same core group of guys, very, very unusual in, in the
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.840]   NBA and in today's NBA, even less.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.800]   It's amazing that you had such a, an incredible career for so long with one
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.400]   team, a common theme, talking to people that played with you over your whole
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.320]   career, hearing people say that nobody could figure you out.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.840]   You were the toughest to defend.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.520]   There are tapes of every game and you played almost probably with playoffs
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.040]   and everything, a hundred games a year.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.840]   How did you manage to keep that mystery alive and evolve your style in a way
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.800]   that people, even as you were retiring, couldn't figure you out?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.000]   Was that you?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Was that coaches?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.440]   Was that a combination?
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.960]   I had no idea, man.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:20.760]   I kept hearing some, some of the comments of some all-stars and some other great
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.200]   defenders that, and I thought I was pretty straightforward with my game.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.840]   Even, even the, I wanted to go left.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.960]   If I couldn't go left, then I, well, I would make some sort of move to go back
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.920]   left, and if not, I started to develop some counter moves, like a step back,
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.000]   going right, or some little tools.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.080]   But, um, I never saw that.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.520]   I never felt it.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.080]   It's not that I'm just saying it because it sounds well or something.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.880]   Even the, this, the Eurostep that, that now is a word that we all
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.560]   heard before it didn't exist.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.880]   I didn't know I was doing anything unusual.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:06.320]   I was using the only tool I had to go by guys like that were 50 to 60 pounds
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.680]   heavier and taller, and you could jump more than me.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.400]   So I couldn't go over them vertically.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   So I had to go sideways.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.560]   And for me, for me, it was so natural and so automatic, but then I started to, you
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.800]   know, to hear people talk about that, how unique it was that I look like a squirrel
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.720]   going between the cars and stuff like that.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.080]   So again, where, where did it come from?
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.720]   No clue.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.000]   I just play the only way I, I could to survive in this, in this harsh
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.200]   environment of super athletes.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.040]   I mean, super athletes is, is unbelievable, right?
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.600]   You're on the main stage for a game played around the world and, and
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.280]   it's not just raw talent, right?
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.080]   I have to imagine that to do everything that a professional NBA player does.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.800]   It's, it's more than that.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.560]   It's also about grit and willpower and determination.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.240]   I've heard you say that most players in any sport lose more than they win.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.400]   How do you push yourself forward when, you know, you're operating in such an
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.680]   uncertain league in terms of what'll happen next season, in terms of whether
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.520]   you've won or lost, how do you, how did you get through that mentally and how did
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.360]   you push yourself through all the hard times?
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.040]   Well, I wasn't good at that at the beginning.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.760]   I didn't take losses accountably.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.160]   I was very tough on myself.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.400]   I was always being very competitive.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.520]   And I always mentioned that it's not that I, I nourished or
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.600]   I tried to be competitive.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.880]   I was competitive from, from day one.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.520]   I competed with them with my brothers for grades.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.320]   I competed with friends about who had the best, whatever, shot from
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.280]   half court or whatever, at anything I competed hard and that brings a lot of
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.040]   obsession sort of, because I didn't want to lose at anything.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.560]   And I, I dragged that all my career.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.000]   And I never, maybe until the last three, four years, I really
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.160]   never learned to lose properly.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.200]   I took it too hard and it was very strict on myself.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:22.160]   And it's a, it's a skill that I had to, to develop, to, to think about it,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   to read about it, to talk about it.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.240]   And then towards the end, when, when my performance was starting to decay in
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.480]   some way, I was not the same as before.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.760]   I started to, to be nicer to, to myself, right.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:43.040]   I, to, to allow more mistakes, to accept that the time was doing its thing and
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.800]   that I was not as fast as before, and I was not as effective and that everything
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.560]   was hurting longer than before.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.840]   And that's when I started to, to learn and enjoy other things too.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.640]   But it took me a while.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.400]   I was quite, quite obsessed for the biggest chunk of my career.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.240]   Are there things that you think if you knew them earlier in your career, it
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.000]   would have made it easier to deal with losing?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.200]   For sure.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.680]   I could have loved to be nicer to myself.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:20.120]   As I, as I said before, it was sometimes too much and maybe that drove me to be
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   better, to add other skills or to prepare for a game, both mentally and physically
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:33.680]   better, but maybe on the satisfaction or happiness level at the present time, I
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.400]   could have been much better.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.680]   So, you know, it's, it's a matter of priorities for sure.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:47.160]   I would tell my, the younger me to be nicer, to relax a little bit, to accept
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.680]   that sometimes you're going to lose because there's so there's 30 teams and
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.600]   only one wins.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.880]   So those were some of the things that I, I would have liked to accept early on
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.280]   because I, I would say my last three years were wonderful mentally and even
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.160]   physically because I was 38, 39 and 40.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.240]   And I'm basically, I had no, no injuries before I did.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:17.680]   And I was mentally in a, in a great spot that really helped me to, to thrive, even
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.120]   not having the first step as I used to, or the explosiveness.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.280]   I mean, you just brought up playing in your late thirties and even at 40.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.560]   So I did some homework.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.320]   It looks like about 30 people ever have played in the NBA in their forties.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.280]   And right now I think there's one player over 37.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.760]   So I guess the, the question is not a long one.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.360]   It's how, like, was it diet routine?
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.800]   Like what led you to do this thing that currently there's one
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.960]   person doing in the world?
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.720]   Again, as always, it's a big, big combination of things, right?
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.840]   I can't underestimate the value of luck.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.280]   I never had a big Achilles tendon injury or ACL or NCL or whatever.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.160]   Something that could really affect my career, all my injuries or
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.840]   surgeries were minor scopes.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.920]   You miss a month here and there, and then you're back.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.640]   So, so that helped, of course.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.280]   The other thing that I think I, I did well is to take care of my body, right?
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.240]   I was never, even when I was young, much of a excess type of guy.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.320]   I didn't go out.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.360]   I didn't do drugs, alcohol.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:37.800]   I had a pretty steady routine towards basketball, but then at 35, when I
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:44.200]   started to see more muscular problems, more strains and tears and things like
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:50.160]   that, I, I had to make a decision if I was going to just struggle to the end of
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.280]   my career, or if I was going to be in a good spot, even though, as I said before,
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.800]   I was not going to be that fast or recovered that quick, but I, at that
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:07.000]   time, I started to adjust my sleeping patterns, eating patterns, my therapy,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.720]   stretching and mobility, breathing, and a lot of little tools.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.360]   So at 35, I hired my own physio that came and lived with me basically one
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.880]   month, one week a month, because he lived in Spain and he really took care of me.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:30.600]   The spurs also improved their, their staff and to compliment all that, Pap
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.720]   started to not play me on back-to-backs.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.360]   So I was being very well taken care of by the organization.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.440]   I had a good genetic, I guess, code to, to help me to recover quick
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.600]   and not have bad injuries.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.800]   And at the same time, I did my best to be very purposeful on every
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.240]   time I had the opportunity, every meal, every night, my schedule and all that.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.040]   So again, multiple factors.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.840]   And what did some of those things you were doing on your own for, for those
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.200]   of us who, who aren't going to fly someone from Spain in to live with us
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.000]   once a week, what kinds of changes did you make to sleep, to food or diet or
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.880]   exercise?
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.440]   No, nothing too surprising.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:18.280]   Things that you heard about a million times, cut down on sugars, white flour,
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.280]   all the stuff that you could see in a package that you don't know where it
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:22.800]   came from.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.880]   I tried to avoid it.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:30.120]   I need foods that your great grandfather would know what it is a hundred years
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.520]   ago, then sleeping and resting every opportunity I had because before, even
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:42.400]   though I told you I didn't go out, again, finished arrive home at 11, 12, and I
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.640]   would watch a movie and hang out with my wife or do some, and then didn't really
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.840]   give importance to, to sleep.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.280]   And then I started to read about it and realize that, that, that was the time
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.680]   where your muscles, your head, your immune system, and everything kind of
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.040]   regroup and your body recovers quicker if you sleep well and all that.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:11.440]   So sleep, well, food, I mentioned then sometimes with my physio, we came home
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:17.040]   after a game and we would work on relaxing some of the muscle groups that
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.120]   worked the most where I was tight the day after we will go and do a mobility
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.520]   routine, stretching.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.000]   So it was a lot of work, but it was definitely worth it.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.360]   Both the, the, the mental and the physical investment.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.600]   Did, did you ever get into any kind of breathing mindfulness kind of training
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.520]   in the, in that regard?
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.960]   Yes.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   And that also had a role.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:48.160]   I think it was in 2015 when I was starting to consider the possibility of
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.240]   retiring because I was not in a great spot and meditation with a, with a
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.600]   teacher here in San Antonio really helped me to, to gain, well, we talked
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.920]   before, be less demanding and less obsessed with the game and just value
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   other things, the present moment and all that.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.960]   So in 2015, I started meditating and, and it had a huge impact on me that
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:22.280]   first year to, to enjoy a loss, to, to be present and valuing that at 38, I
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.160]   was still playing in the NBA in a place where I wanted to be in a city where I
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.120]   wanted to be with teammates that I wanted to be with.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.400]   And that changed the perspective of just the finished goal, right?
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.720]   If I win the last game, I want a championship meant satisfaction.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.080]   If I didn't have, he felt like, well, frustration.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.440]   That, that made a big impact on me.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.080]   How, how common were some of these techniques in the NBA at the time?
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.880]   And were they things that you found valuable and shared with people on the
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.600]   team, at least within your locker room?
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.560]   No, it was, it was not very common back then.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.520]   Now, now I think it is, it's something that is more talked about.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.640]   I was kind of not saying hiding it, but I didn't really know.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.080]   I thought of, I'm skeptical in every aspect of my life usually.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.840]   But all of a sudden I started reading one, two, three of the guys
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.760]   that I listened to a lot or, or read.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:26.600]   And then I, I remember I got actually pop gave me a waking up by, by Sam Harris.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   And when I saw this guy that I admire, that I, that I know is a scientist and
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.280]   went through a lot of stuff and tested things, and he was the way he put it out
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.160]   there, I said, no, I, I, this is for me too.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.560]   So before I thought it was more of a, you know, woo thing.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.680]   And then I started to, to appreciate it and practice it.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.440]   And I saw great benefit.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.680]   I feel like it's in the recent past become a big thing.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.840]   I met, I met someone a few weeks ago who was a mindfulness coach to
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.720]   some European football leagues on Byron Munich, the team.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.880]   He was surprised that that was not a thing anyone had really ever heard
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.520]   of when he went and talked to them.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.440]   And so it's still early days, but it sounds like it had a huge
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.280]   impact on your last few years.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.480]   And I think it's pretty valuable that people are starting to wake up to it.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.640]   And, and I think it works outside of professional sports.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.240]   I find that I'm more productive on days that I get a good night's sleep and
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.960]   that I feel good about what I ate.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.040]   And it sometimes seems counterintuitive.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.360]   You're like, Oh, if I, if I sleep less, I have more time to work.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.120]   And it's like, no, no, if you sleep more, your work is better.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.320]   Definitely.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.800]   I, I, I couldn't agree more after the, after reading Matthew Walker's book
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:52.200]   about why we sleep, I think it's called also my perspective changed even more.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.080]   I knew what was starting to be valuable, but when he put all the data, all the
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   studies in it, it has nothing to do well, it has to do with athletes, but it has to
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:10.280]   do also with programmers or lawyers or anybody that wants to be proactive and
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.400]   energetic and healthy and feeling good about themselves.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.000]   So the value of sleep is super, super important and many times
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.920]   underestimated still to this day.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.840]   So I try to advocate for that too.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:30.400]   Whenever I talk to younger generations or, or even companies, because, uh, for
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:36.080]   example, the CEO of any company, I don't want the CEO of any company to do all
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.840]   night wake working.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.680]   I want them to be asleep and rested and creative for the day after and be in a
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.960]   good mood to, to treat their employees well.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:55.600]   So no, it's not about only athletes, it's about anybody around.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.520]   They got to eat well, they got to do exercise and they got to sleep.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.040]   How, and so now you went from playing 82 games, practices, playoffs.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.880]   I think every year you were at the Spurs.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.840]   So now, now you're kind of retired.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.360]   You got time on your hands.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.640]   I know you're doing some work now with the Spurs, but how do you spend your time now?
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.160]   Well, I, I do work out a lot.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.960]   I still do.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.240]   I play tennis.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.320]   I do two things that I couldn't do before.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.640]   I don't play basketball at all.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.680]   Zero basketball in the last three and a half years, but I ride the
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.840]   bike three times a week, play tennis twice.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.120]   Then I'm a father of three boys and that's a lot of work.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   Always.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.840]   I start, I'm starting to get slowly into BC.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.880]   The Spurs also hire me this year to do some consulting.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.560]   So I'm spending time with them.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.640]   So I keep plenty BC, man.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.600]   I, I love what I do.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.480]   I love my flexibility of time.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:59.040]   I like my peace of mind being present for my family and traveling with them.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.320]   I couldn't be in a, in a better spot.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:06.560]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.640]   reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.480]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.360]   I kickstart my day with athletic greens, and I am excited to be partnering
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.560]   with them for this episode.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.560]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I've
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.040]   kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.960]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.800]   It tastes so good when it's cold.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.680]   And I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day, which
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.800]   is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.120]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.520]   and superfoods, and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.640]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.

[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.600]   year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel

[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.720]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.480]   day, and that's thanks to Viore.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.120]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.840]   They make performance apparel.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.400]   That's incredibly versatile.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.800]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.480]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.320]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.720]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.360]   right now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.160]   And it's not just for men.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.920]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.560]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.520]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.120]   comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.480]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.400]   it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.720]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their Meta
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.640]   Pants can even work for a night out.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.080]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.

[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.760]   jobs and enjoying time with the family.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.400]   You mentioned you're biking.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.320]   You mentioned you're playing tennis.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.280]   What advice to anyone listening here that's similarly in their late thirties,
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.080]   early forties, couple kids trying to get in shape, what have you learned
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.480]   about exercise and fitness, your career?
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.320]   Obviously you have a very gifted set of genetics, but what would people take home
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.080]   as, as ways to kind of really keep exercise and fitness in their routine?
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.120]   That you have to do it, that it doesn't only help your body, your muscles,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.960]   your bones, but your head too.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:17.480]   Your, your head needs a healthy, active body.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:23.320]   So some people may not start because they think they can ride 30 miles or
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   they can run for 10K or, or swim a bunch of laps, but you start with a step.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.640]   And, and there's a million things nowadays you can do with there's, there
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:39.560]   are workouts online for anybody now with a, with a band attached to a door, you
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:46.480]   can do a full workout and you can buy one kettlebell and do as many swings as you
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:46.880]   want.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.440]   It's a matter of convincing yourself and ideally doing it with somebody else that
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.920]   can, you can challenge yourself and you can have some accountability, but before
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.640]   you used to have a membership, you needed a membership to a, to a gym, or you needed
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.560]   us a bike or going somewhere or having a coach.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.440]   Now you can do it with a band and it's, there are so many options and he's, he's
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.640]   going to affect your mood.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.040]   It's going to affect your health.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.840]   So yeah, there are no excuses.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.440]   You just got to convince yourself that you got to do it.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.240]   And do you ever have days where you wake up and you're like, I just don't want to
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.680]   do it today.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.240]   I'm just not going to take that bike ride.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.600]   Or if you have that feeling, how do you end up on the bike?
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.320]   I tell you this story because I loved it.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.480]   My first year and a half or two years, I was lifting too.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   Now I'm not lifting.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:45.200]   I got to go back to it, but I, I was going two or three times a week to the, to the
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.720]   spurs, to, to lift.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:53.120]   When the guys were gone, I was going in and having a, doing my routine and I was
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.680]   enjoying it.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.800]   I was, I was fine.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.520]   But this one day I get to the facility, I look at the weights, I say, you know what?
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.720]   I don't feel like it today.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.400]   I turned around, I went back home and I felt like a million bucks.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.440]   Nobody, nobody tells me to do it.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.080]   I just doing it because I want.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.960]   And if I don't, I don't do it.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.520]   And the same with the bike.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.840]   The thing is that there are way more times that I want to do it, that I enjoy, you
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.640]   know, being outdoors and riding on the creeks with trees.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:29.040]   And I just love also the, the, the feeling that you get once you're done.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:37.400]   And so it's, it's, again, I'm in a very privileged situation and I do it because I
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:37.720]   love it.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.920]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.880]   I've got a Peloton.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.240]   And so I started biking and I was one of those crazy people that had never actually
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.600]   biked outside really.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.360]   I mean, obviously I've ridden a bicycle, but finally we got bikes and we got a seat
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.640]   for the, our daughter.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.240]   And I was like, wow, this is great.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.480]   Now I'm like getting back into biking outside.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.040]   It's fun.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.600]   And, and I find that when your exercise is something fun to do with someone, I can't
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.240]   remember, I listened to a podcast and someone said they started exercising with
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.480]   their partner and I'd always thought of that, but my wife and I started running
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.120]   together and then we were like, oh, that's fun.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.920]   Like the more you can make your exercise fun, I think the easier it is to get out
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.360]   and do it.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.320]   And accountability is huge.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.880]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.760]   And people are coming with great ideas.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:24.000]   They are, they are gamifying the, the exercise, they're giving you tools, they're
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.440]   going, they're making, making it easy to do it.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:35.080]   So there are a bunch of startups and ideas and machines and, and kettlebells and
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.000]   bands that can help multiple group muscles and cardio and all that.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.960]   So it's, it's great.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.480]   You mentioned startups.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.360]   I know you also mentioned you're, you're getting involved with VC.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.880]   What has it been like to transition from someone focused on one complete industry
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:56.040]   so much to, to dive deep into a totally different industry where I'm sure you
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.240]   probably now look up to investors and founders and say, oh, I got a lot to
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:32:59.520]   learn.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.760]   And they all look up to you and say, oh my gosh, legendary basketball player.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.280]   What's it, what's it like entering a totally different industry in this part
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:06.800]   of your career?
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.520]   I always admired that industry.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:17.360]   I, I love tech and I try to, to dig into new ideas, software, hardware, try to
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.640]   learn, try to stay current and, and informed.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:27.040]   But now with a little more time and some people that I met, they, they got me
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:27.880]   closer to it.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.360]   And I, I find it fascinating.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.520]   I'm so clueless about all this world that it is very exciting to go and listen to
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.240]   these people and how they came up with the idea, what they are trying to do,
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.480]   accomplish, how they set up the mission, how they recruit the team.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:50.760]   So I'm just at this point trying to be a fly in the wall, trying to learn, trying
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.640]   to figure it out how and be next to very smart people that know what they're doing,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.160]   that they have done it before.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.640]   So I'm not in a rush to do anything.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.240]   I don't, I don't, I'm not in it for, for the money.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.120]   I just like the thrill, the, the, the opportunities that these startups are
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.600]   giving us to make our lives better or the environment better.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.200]   So I I'm there to, to learn because I was always, was curious about it.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:23.720]   And at the same time, I also was able to build the capital and have the luxury to
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:29.120]   put just a little bit, little part of it and try to contribute and hopefully get a
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.320]   good return on the investment.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.520]   But it's been very exciting to, to be part of the one, some of those meetings.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.760]   And they also, I also learned that they want to know my side of the story, how I
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:46.240]   was part of teams and organizations and the examples of leadership or going through
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.520]   tough times or resiliency and all that.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.680]   So I guess we are both learning.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   I'm jealous of the stats you have though.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.880]   I was thinking about how there's a lot of commonalities between running a company,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.120]   you're working on a team, you're all trying to compete with other companies.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.400]   And then I was like, man, it must be both terrifying and wonderful to know that
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.840]   there are just stats that help you understand how you're doing and you can
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.520]   compare yourself against other people.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.840]   Now you're experiencing a world outside of stats.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.680]   It's like, Oh, how am I doing now?
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   I have to rely on feedback and conversations and feel myself worth more
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.920]   than I can just say, Oh, well, obviously I put up this many points last night.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.560]   I did a good job.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.000]   It is a completely different world.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.600]   That's why I'm going with very humble objectives, just to listen to stories,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:41.360]   to try to contribute to causes and things that I care about, that I'm interested in.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:48.480]   So again, I take it as a completely learning experience and trying at the
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.720]   same time to contribute to causes that I care about or values that I care about.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.640]   So I'm putting my intention in those aspects.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.640]   And you mentioned earlier, your father was in basketball.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.760]   I mentioned the stats of that making you more likely to be in there.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.160]   Do you think basketball will play a big role in your time going forward?
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.800]   I know you're working a little with the Spurs, but you haven't
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.360]   touched a basketball in three years.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   The other day I grabbed it.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.960]   I wanted to shoot 10 shots to see how it felt.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.880]   I couldn't make one zero for 10 threes.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.080]   And it was unbelievable muscle memories.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:29.560]   Incredible.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.680]   It's been three years and I dedicated basically 30 years of
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.560]   my life to shooting hooks and I couldn't make one.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.360]   So it's amazing.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.000]   Amazing.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.840]   But at the same time, I, with all my experiences, background, where I came
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   from the languages that I played in many places in Italy, in Argentina,
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.400]   Olympics, World Cups and all that, you know, gave me some insider
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.520]   information that is still very valuable.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.520]   And I wanted to share, I wanted to talk to the younger generations to
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.240]   tell them that the mistakes I made, the, the things that really worked for
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.240]   me, what I wish I knew earlier as, as we talked before.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.960]   So in some way I'm trying to, to contribute to, to the
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.880]   organization in that aspect.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.360]   The thing is that I'm, I'm still not ready to go full time.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   I, I don't want to lose my freedom to, to go to Argentina, for example,
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.400]   now in December and January, that it's summer there, I don't want to lose
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.760]   the opportunity to go spring break with the kids in March because they
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.640]   have a week off their school.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:43.240]   So I'm starting to go back and be connected to the game.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:48.320]   I'm still not that committed to be like all in.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.840]   And I don't even know if it's ever going to happen.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.360]   We'll see when my kids are older, but at this point, I, again, I'm
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   loving where my position, my, my privilege.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   We've talked a lot on the show about financial independence.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.280]   And part of that is, is to buy the time and be able to spend time doing what
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.640]   you want, which you're clearly doing.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.280]   What's been the greatest challenge you've had since leaving basketball?
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.760]   I really didn't have any challenges.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.720]   I, I, I've been really enjoying it.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:23.240]   I thought I was going to be a little antsy to, to feel that adrenaline rush,
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:29.160]   the, the, the pressure and the responsibility, but I really don't.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.680]   Actually, I went through it for a long time.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:39.760]   I, I had to, to live with that pressure, with that responsibility.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.680]   And, and I'm not seeking it.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.000]   I'm just, again, loving my peace of mind.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.240]   So I do miss a little bit the, the locker room, the camaraderie, the dinners after
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.800]   the game, where we just hang out and talk about stuff and, or preparing
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.960]   together for a, one of those games.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.160]   But again, I, I'm having a great life.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.840]   I I'm enjoying the time with my family and going ride the bike
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.320]   for 20, 30 miles in the outdoors.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:14.160]   So I really didn't face the challenges that I was afraid I was going to live.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.160]   But maybe also that I, it took me a while to, the last three years of my
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.760]   career, I was kind of preparing for this time.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   So I did a lot of things to be sure that I was going to be in a good spot.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.040]   And I have a great family.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.600]   My wife is great, very patient with me too.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.880]   So I, I really, I didn't face any challenges so far.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.240]   Was there anything you did with your family and your relationship during what I can
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.640]   only imagine was a very busy season to keep that, that relationship strong with
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.320]   your family?
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.800]   I know lots of people, whether you're starting a company or playing sports,
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.480]   it's hard.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:56.120]   You're away a lot and you put a lot of weight on, on your spouse's shoulders.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.040]   What, what let you get through that?
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.880]   It sounds like you're in a great spot right now after a lot of years.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.040]   A lot of years.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   And I'm telling you, she, she's been with me since my last year in Italy.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.960]   So she went through all my career in the NBA and I don't know, I guess I, I got
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.920]   lucky with her that she was always very patient and all my craziness and that she
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:24.120]   took all the, the summers off, like the summers where I was supposed to spend
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.000]   time with, with her and my family.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.080]   Many times I just went to play workups and Olympic games and it was not an easy
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.720]   time for her, but I guess she understood it, how I felt and how important it was
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.320]   for me, the kids were too little, so they didn't really know what was happening.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:46.800]   But now we are in a place where we have that flexibility that she's more of the
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.280]   priorities or the priority on where she wants to go and what she wants to do.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.840]   And I try to help her a lot with the kids and be present.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:01.640]   So she's, she's enjoying that part too, but I guess we were lucky to find each other.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:08.000]   I feel similarly, and I've gone through a lot of crazy startup stuff and finding
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.280]   someone to go through that with you.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.200]   I assume that was helpful along the way when you're stressed out about
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.720]   losing and all these things.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:19.040]   Well, that, that was huge because as I told you, I was very tough on myself.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:27.480]   So many times, especially earlier, I brought that frustration home too.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:32.600]   And I, I didn't want to talk about the game and it was moody, but then
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.280]   slowly we, we started to, to figure it out, each other saying, okay, she's
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.800]   not going to mention even the game that just finished and I'm going to leave
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:47.480]   that game that just finished in the locker room and then after big losses
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.760]   or huge wins, and we were going to just hang out, enjoy the kids or do things
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.880]   that I had no connection to my job.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.200]   And we found a great chemistry there.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:06.880]   So I was never, I never brought basketball at home for my wife, parents,
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.520]   friends, whenever somebody came to San Antonio to hang out with me and, you
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.800]   know, spend quality time, it was just about us, what was happening in the
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   world or whatever, but no basketball.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:25.000]   Basketball was from the locker room and in, never out.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.240]   Getting the crew together.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.800]   Isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.520]   I get it.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.800]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.080]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.160]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:45.040]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.600]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.640]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.480]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.560]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.440]   you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.680]   to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.000]   houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.480]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.160]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.080]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.160]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.080]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.440]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:45.840]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money,
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:50.000]   and so much more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.520]   your situation, which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.800]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.720]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.240]   in everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.200]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.040]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.600]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.920]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.480]   about alternative investments.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first-generation wealth, young,

[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.640]   What about with your kids?
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.920]   I know you grew up with a family of basketball players and you obviously
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.880]   grew up to be quite successful.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.280]   Are your kids learning to play basketball yet?
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.360]   They are.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.160]   They are learning and they love it and they try to watch everything.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.920]   So now I'm watching more.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.520]   We play a little fantasy game with other families and they absolutely love it.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.680]   And now I'm way more relaxed.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.600]   Now I don't care about talking about basketball.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.680]   I mean, I'm happy to do so when they do ask questions and what used to happen
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.800]   back then, I was, you know, ex-players, then we do talk.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:15.400]   But during my years of complete obsession, basketball was not mentioned at home.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:15.880]   Wow.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.880]   Yeah, I struggle with that because my wife and I work at the same company.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.240]   So talking about work at home is something that on one hand, we're fortunate
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.040]   that we've usually, I never want to come home and say, "Oh, guess what's
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:27.640]   happening at work?"
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.680]   Because she already knows.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.560]   So I guess maybe that was my hack was if you want to avoid talking about work
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.880]   at home, if you both work at the same place, you can kind of all be on the
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.920]   same page all the time.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.080]   But that's a good point.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.160]   But no, in my case, everybody was, nobody's in the locker room.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.320]   Nobody know what the coach said or what the instructions were.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.080]   So when somebody was criticizing that somebody didn't pass it to who, or that
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.520]   your defense was not good, or they didn't know what was happening indoors.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:58.040]   We did, and we talked about it and we watched videos and we analyzed and we
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.520]   were, oh, it was too much.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:07.240]   So when I, whenever I got home, I needed to be able to not think that much.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.080]   Yeah, well, that's good that you could get on the same page.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.120]   So while we've talked a lot about basketball and your career, that wasn't
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.680]   what kind of brought us together.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.920]   And, you know, I know we've connected through you listening to some podcasts
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.800]   that I was on with Kevin Rose, and we've shared some conversations about money
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.440]   and travel, so I want to start off with something I found on Twitter that in
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.080]   2011, you said this was the year you became a minivan dad and that you were
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:34.720]   proud of it.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:39.520]   And, and since technically I think this is a finance podcast, at least a little
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.400]   bit, athletes so often go bankrupt.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.800]   They spend lavishly.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.200]   You seem to have the smallest ego of any athlete I've heard talk.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.720]   How did you end up down this different path where I can't imagine that the
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.160]   hottest car for, for an NBA athlete in 2011 was a minivan?
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.520]   Yeah, it wasn't.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.640]   It really wasn't.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:04.840]   I thought it was the, the best we could get for having twins.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.280]   We had twins.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.120]   We had a bunch of stuff to put in there.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.040]   We have a dog.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.560]   And after doing some research, I mean, even is the way to go.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   And it took me a while to convince my wife, my wife, you know, you didn't want
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.560]   anything to do with it.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.000]   And I said, I think you're going to love it.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.960]   And we are going to be so comfortable.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.360]   And the kids were too little to leave them in school.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.720]   So I did it and we were very happy about it.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.800]   We still are actually, we still have, you know, we are 10 years later.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.880]   We're still our minivan dads.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.080]   She drives it more than me now, but, um, I remember one time we were playing.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.920]   I don't remember where he was back then, but I was shooting free throws and Tyson
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:52.120]   Chandler comes to me and says, so you have a minivan and two, we are two in the NBA.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.800]   Now I say, no, we are three.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.360]   I got a friend in, in Brooklyn that has one too.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:00.200]   So we were three players probably in the NBA driving minivans.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.840]   So very small minority.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.360]   Not just minivans, but watches and all kinds of things to spend money on.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.560]   Did you, do you think it was growing up internationally or what do you think
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.240]   helped you not go down the path?
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.640]   So many athletes go down when they make money and end up spending it all so
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.040]   quickly.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:23.560]   I never attached my self-esteem to a possession.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:31.160]   So that would be how to summarize it, that the car I drove or the clothes I wore
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.600]   or jewelry never meant anything for me.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:42.960]   So yeah, I never felt like I had to show that I was doing good, that I, what I
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.920]   did was showing it like that.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.120]   I was playing for the team.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.120]   I wanted to play there.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.280]   I will, we were winning championships and I let that do the talking.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.440]   So I never felt like I had to show where I was.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.280]   I guess the ego was part of it too.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:07.240]   I never had a strong one and I never wanted to or cared about living lavishly.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.720]   Of course I have a great house.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:15.040]   I, I, I played in the NBA for many years that helped me make a lot of money and I
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:21.600]   could live well, but I never felt like I needed to dress flashy or drive half a
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.320]   million dollar car.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.640]   So it was not my thing.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.760]   Is there, is there a thing in life that you love that you're willing to upgrade
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.840]   and enjoy outside of the stuff that you just kind of live in a more standard way?
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:40.440]   Well, I, I like living in a very nice house, so if I have to splurge, I'll do
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.160]   it and that, I like to travel.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:49.120]   So when we travel, we don't go to the most economic places.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:54.160]   I mean, we, we choose the place where we're going to go and we go there and we
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:51:00.440]   believe that those moments with the family or having a great trip and traveling
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:06.480]   business, it is a priority because it enhances how much we enjoy the, the
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.960]   experience and we do it.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:14.560]   But then again, I don't need to drive my kids to school in a, in a car that costs
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.160]   300,000 or $500,000.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:22.920]   It is, for me, it's not, it doesn't add anything to, to my way of living.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:27.680]   I mean, you say that travel is the place that you'll spend on, but I also happen
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.160]   to know from our conversations that you, you dabble a little bit in the, in the
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.960]   game of credit card points and miles.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.040]   So how did you get into that?
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.840]   We all have credit cards and then I started to get those that you can add
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:45.480]   more points on and then use it for, for traveling and business.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:51.120]   So I guess I listened to somebody talking about it and I, I knew I had a million
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.240]   points with my credit card and I was not using it.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:52:02.400]   So all of a sudden I searched for ways to travel and, or upgrade tickets.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:07.480]   And I, I get to this website, I think it was the points guy or something like
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:13.400]   that, and I started to dig in and get it, no going in the rabbit hole and reading.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.320]   I said, Oh my God, look at this.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:18.480]   This is a word that I had no idea about.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:24.440]   So I started to, to get curious and, and get different cards for different points.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:30.640]   So currently I have millions of points that I'm not really using it.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.800]   I used them last year.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.880]   For example, we are five and we traveled to Argentina and we flew in business and
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:41.200]   I used them with miles and it was, you know, learning from you, Chris a great
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.640]   deal, I got, I got a good deal, but overall I don't use them.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.080]   So I'm good at crewing.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:48.920]   I'm not used.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.880]   I'm not good using them yet.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:58.760]   So working on that, but again, wherever we decide to go next summer, it's not going
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.800]   to depend on where I get the best deal, where we want to go.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.560]   We'll see with my wife and we'll decide, okay, we want to do a safari in Africa or
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:10.920]   we want to do or to Costa Rica or Fiji, whatever, whatever we decide we're going
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.760]   to do, that's the priority.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:18.040]   Then if I get the points, if I get the, the perks of the million points that I
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.200]   have, great, we'll do it.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.760]   If not, we'll just go there and use the points at a different time.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.760]   But I, you know, since I am spending a lot of money in credit cards every year,
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.480]   I thought, okay, let's accumulate these points.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:36.160]   If they are, they are to grab and I try to optimize my spending.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.000]   And yeah, true.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.440]   I learned a lot from you, Chris.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.600]   And how many cards are you using now?
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.080]   Five.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.600]   Are you, are you proud of me?
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.840]   I was going to go for three.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.680]   So five.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   I'm no, I got five, uh, one business one, uh, Amex, Visa, another Amex.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.120]   And, uh, the fifth one is, I know I just got it from my wife.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:57.640]   Another one.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.760]   So my wife, my wife is pissed at you.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.360]   She doesn't like you because I kept telling her, well, you go to the supermarket, use
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:04.800]   this one.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.040]   And she used the other one and it gets yell at, but it's just a way, a way, a way
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.680]   of optimizing and trying to, to accumulate more points.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.000]   But we are, we are not crazy about it.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.320]   The way it all changes is you go on some really, really expensive trip.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.360]   Let's say you decide we're flying on Emirates.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:26.120]   We have our suites on the plane and then you, and you're drinking Dom and you're
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.160]   like, Hey, this was a hundred percent free, zero dollars.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.880]   That, that moment is when the switch flipped.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:37.800]   I heard those stories and I'm ready to, to test them.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.640]   The thing is that we are, you are just not going that far to nowadays.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.680]   We're going to Argentina.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.760]   We don't have those flights.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.600]   And we are going to mainly near here.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.720]   The kids are still kind of young.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.840]   So, but, but soon, soon we are going to start following your advice.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.880]   Where are places you want to go that are on your list for when maybe the world
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.320]   opens up?
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.960]   The immediate one is a safari in Africa.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.200]   We, we do want to take the kids.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:11.000]   My wife wanted to go there for four years and that's something that is in the
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.080]   immediate bucket list.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:18.200]   Then Italy, Spain, there are two places that we spent some time in.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.040]   I, we actually lived in Italy for four years.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.040]   We want to go back.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.880]   We believe that the kids need to be a little older.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.800]   They get more bored in there.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:30.840]   There's not too much to do, but soon we'll go back because I miss it.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.080]   And I haven't been back in lean 15 years now.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.320]   So those are the two immediate ones.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.160]   Then of course, Australia and New Zealand are coming soon.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.160]   The problem is that the time of the weather, December and January, we want to
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.680]   be in Argentina is when we enjoy the summer with our friends and family.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.920]   So eventually Australia and New Zealand are coming.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.760]   I mean, I also remember, I think it's tough to get from South America to Africa
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.520]   and to Australia, New Zealand.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.320]   I don't know if there are flights now, but there used to be that the only way to
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.400]   get from like Argentina to Africa was to go up to Europe or the U S.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.840]   Well, yes.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:16.080]   Whenever we go to Africa is going to be from here, but I, I took a flight that I
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:21.000]   don't think they do it anymore, or maybe our New Zealand does it, but it goes under.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:29.160]   Oh, so from Argentina to Auckland, there's a direct flight, 17 hour flight
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:33.640]   that goes through the Southern pole is, is pretty cool.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:39.560]   I I've done it actually with the Argentinian in 1997 to play a U21 World
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.480]   Cup, and we were fired up to do that.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.080]   And a couple of years ago, New Zealand was starting to do it.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:50.400]   Now with all this, probably they're not, but, um, no, probably not a hundred
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:56.920]   percent, so most of the trips are starting from, from Texas.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.640]   Okay.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.680]   And, and what kind of travel are you?
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:03.080]   I heard, I heard somewhere on the internet that you have a no room service rule,
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.520]   but you know, what's your style of, of travel when you get to a new place?
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:12.240]   No, I, the, the nose, uh, room service was when I was playing, I had most of my
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:19.040]   teammates just got to a city and stayed inside from the minute they got there to
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.680]   the minute they left, they went just to a there and I couldn't take that I'm not
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.200]   American.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.960]   I didn't know any of the cities I got drafted and I didn't know what San Antonio
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.080]   was, where was it?
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.000]   What Texas was?
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.720]   I had no clue.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:35.560]   So by the time I got here, I said, no, I want to see these cities.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.440]   I, I want to walk the city.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.760]   I want to see what they are about.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:45.840]   And of course I had to come combine that with performance part that I wanted to do
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.280]   good.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:51.840]   So whenever there was an opportunity, I went out and I walked and I visit places
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.040]   and I ate at restaurants.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.280]   So I, I, most of the times, like whenever an Argentinian gets to the league, they
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.640]   call me for like, where can I go in Milwaukee?
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.400]   So I'll go to my list and, and text them.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.040]   And anything on your list that are just kind of standouts across the country that
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.120]   that people should check out?
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:17.040]   Well, uh, a lot of people are not excited when they go to Oklahoma city, for
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.760]   example, there, but my, probably my favorite steak house is, is in Oklahoma
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.160]   city.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.800]   So which one is called red and you go there and you order them the skirt steak
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.760]   with truffle risotto.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.360]   It's like I had to do.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.720]   So it's something that I did.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:37.320]   I've done like, you know, the last 10 years that I went to, okay, see, I went to
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:41.200]   that restaurant and I ate that dish because it's outstanding.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.080]   And we did it with my crew, right?
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.440]   We, we had teammates that we were going and we, we all enjoyed that dish, but I
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.120]   had little things in, in almost every seat.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:56.960]   There are some cities that you, the cities on the East, you go only one time a
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.800]   year and many times it's in a back-to-back or it's in January and in Toronto is
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.080]   minus 20 degrees.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:07.640]   So you don't get to do much, but the other cities that I played playoffs or that I've
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.080]   been so many times, then you, you start to, to learn places to go.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.080]   What about Argentina?
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:17.040]   You probably know it better than, than most, if anyone's listening, heading to
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.840]   Argentina, any, any must do's?
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.720]   Many, many must do's.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:24.240]   The only problem with us is that we are a big country too.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.960]   And people think that they'll go to Argentina and get it done in a couple of
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.200]   days and it's, it's big.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:37.480]   So you got in the Northeast, the amazing Iguazu waterfalls, something incredible
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.200]   that everybody should witness.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.760]   But bring a change of clothes.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:47.640]   So my experience at Iguazu was, I was completely head to toe drenched, not a
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.040]   single dry spot.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.120]   Yes, I agree.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:55.720]   Very humid is the jungle, but it's worth witnessing.
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:02.160]   In the South, we've got the glaciers that are just outstanding too, Perito Moreno
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.440]   Glacier, and it's a wonderful national park.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   I love it too.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.640]   I got to go back actually.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:15.240]   Then on the Southeast, you got the whale watching that is so top-notch that is
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.400]   amazing in Puerto Madryn.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:24.960]   Also penguins, and you can see the orcas actually getting out of the water to try
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.440]   to get a sea lion.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.520]   It's the only place it happens in the world.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.280]   I haven't witnessed it yet.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.320]   The times I went, it didn't happen.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.280]   You got to be lucky, but you see the orcas many times.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.400]   Wine country, Buenos Aires is amazing.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:44.240]   Swamps, no, I could be talking about Argentina all day.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.280]   This is a wonderful country that you, everybody should spend some time going to.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.640]   We need Manu's Argentina travel show.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.280]   It could be your next YouTube adventure.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.000]   That could be, that could be.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:54.880]   Good idea, Chris.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.640]   Okay.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.200]   I have one last travel question, which is, I always have seen that teams are now all
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.400]   chartering flights, and sometimes you get a flight where every seat is a business
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.120]   class seat.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.600]   Have you been on a flight where it wasn't all business?
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.360]   And if so, how do you decide who on the team gets to sit up front and who sits in
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:12.840]   the back?
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.280]   Well, we are so spoiled.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.640]   We got charters.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:22.000]   So they, well, they actually have room for, I think, 14 players.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.320]   And now there are more than 14 players in team.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:33.080]   So they send some couples to the back, but we, they are planes that are especially
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.600]   a condition for taller players.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.320]   So they have a few that face each other for guys that want to play cards, write,
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.640]   type, or whatever they have facing each other.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.480]   Then they have other ones that sleep the whole time.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.040]   So yeah, those are not flights that you can choose that you can accrue miles.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.680]   You just jump in and you go wherever they tell you to go.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.280]   The coaches have their own stuff too, or they watch the videos, they debate the
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.760]   next steps and plan ahead and, and analyze games after, after they happened.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.800]   And in the way back, they have all the other stuff.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.720]   So again, very, very spoiled for travel, but the NBA players are.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:22.480]   Any, any travel or life hacks to leave us with things you do unique in your, your
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.280]   routine that, you know, someone here might, might want to give a try in their life.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:33.280]   Well, for money, I just listened to the episode with your boss is basically what
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.200]   I've been reading about the last few years.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.080]   And it's so well said that I'm not going to repeat it, go back and listen to him.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.200]   That's the episode with Andy Radcliffe about investing.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:49.920]   We were, when I got here, I'd never had any money, basically.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.880]   I never invested.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.320]   So I had no idea.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.080]   And I was being overcharged.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:01.440]   I was being sold funds owned by the same bank of the guy that proposed them.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.760]   And I was paying super high fees for many years.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.000]   And then I started to read about how to optimize all that.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.800]   And, and choose or invest in index funds with low costs that will
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.760]   mimic S P 500 and loss harvesting.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.240]   So that was something I learned.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.120]   And also the, the value of fiduciary duties.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.840]   When, when you have a financial advisor, I had no idea it existed.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.520]   Nobody told me it was not mentioned.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.800]   And I'm for many that of the guys that came from Europe is automatic.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.840]   I think in Europe, either most of, or all have something like that.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.160]   Somebody will correct them, correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.920]   But when you come to the States is different.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.600]   And sometimes the broker will sell you the funds that are benefit him,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.360]   not you as an investor.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.120]   And that's something I had no idea.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:02.040]   So for many years, I, I kind of suffered between not really suffer, but I, I saw
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.800]   that happening until I, I figured it out, reading a couple of the books and
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.120]   listen to guys like, like Andy, the value of sleep is also something that I've
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.440]   been trying to figure out for years.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.600]   The NBA doesn't propitiate good sleep patterns because of the time that the
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.840]   games are played, the traveling and all that.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:29.000]   And I tried a bunch of gadgets first, first, it was one that attached to the
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.920]   pillow, then it was a Fitbit.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:37.400]   Then finally, I, I, I found a sweet spot with the aura ring that I think gets
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.240]   the best.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:38.840]   There you go.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.600]   That's a bad finger to show.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:40.840]   I know.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.120]   I know.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:41.880]   I realized that.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:47.760]   But, um, gives me very good feedback.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:54.600]   And I think every NBA player athlete or person actually should, should wear on
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.440]   full disclosure.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.320]   I, after I wearing for a year, I decided to invest because I think it's a
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.760]   fantastic product.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.920]   And I don't know, I think that's, I mean, that's, that's about it.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.600]   I think the combination of for like health hack, the combination of workout,
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.880]   sleep and nutrition is unbeatable.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.480]   You'll be happy.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480]   You'll be active.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.040]   You'll feel great about yourself.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.120]   You'll lose weight.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.320]   There are so many, so much data out there that is, is amazing.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.760]   Once you, you get in there and you start digging it, you'll improve, improve
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.480]   yourself a lot.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   You mentioned books.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.960]   I know you love podcasts.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.760]   I know you love books.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.320]   Anything you're reading or listening to lately that you've been.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.480]   Ryan holiday is my advisor and everything is books.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:47.920]   And he has recommended me amazing stuff, great stories, uh, very nurturing and
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:53.200]   learning a lot from his books or the ones that he's recommended me.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:59.760]   Here I got three or four that I read twice that I also gave away, uh,
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.280]   thinking fast and slow.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.960]   I don't know from Danny Kahneman.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.640]   Awesome book.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.040]   Sapiens.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.880]   Also incredible.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:15.320]   Waking up from Sam Harris and I don't have it there, but the one from Jared
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.200]   diamond guns, germs, and steel.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:17.840]   I think it is.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.080]   Yep.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.960]   Fascinating book also about with a similar topic to Sapiens.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.880]   Awesome.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.520]   I have, I have not read that one, so I'll add it to the list.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.320]   Very, very good.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.280]   Highly recommended.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.760]   And money-wise I liked unshakable from Tony Robbins.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:40.360]   So I thought it was not only because of what he said is the people he interviewed
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:46.520]   and the people that talk in that book is the one where I understood about the
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.520]   fiduciary duties and how to invest more consciously.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.760]   It's, it's kind of the wild West still in America when it comes to what a
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.200]   person is allowed to sell you.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.520]   Uh, I think it's crazy.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.080]   They can sell life insurance and pretend it's something else.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.360]   And yeah, it's, it's wild.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.440]   So if you, if you talk to anyone, ask if they're a fiduciary.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.600]   I was, I was a victim for a few years, so yeah.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.120]   Anytime I have the opportunity, I do tell the guys, and I'm very
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.760]   happy that tools like, you know, Wealthfront are coming out because
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:25.440]   on low fees and adapts to what you want to do and they harvest losses.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.520]   And I think it's a, it's a great product.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:28.640]   Thank you.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.320]   All right.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.160]   Any, any last things to share or any place people should be finding you online?
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.720]   No, I'm very easy to find with this type of last name.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.840]   I'm very easy to find.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:43.000]   So I post here and there on Twitter and Instagram, not that much.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.280]   And they can find me at the sports games too.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.840]   Oh yeah.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.400]   I'll have to, I'll have to make it out there.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.120]   I was just in Austin, but, but San Antonio, I'll have to find you at a game.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.840]   Come, come, come join us.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.000]   So Chris, you'll be welcomed.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.280]   We've got a lot to talk about.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.680]   I need to, to learn more about how to use these, these points that I have.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:07:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   We'll have to do a session.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.280]   We'll just figure out, you say, here's where I'm going and we'll
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.480]   figure out how to make it work.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.840]   There you go.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.360]   Awesome.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.800]   Well, thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.760]   Thank you for having me, Chris.

[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.640]   That was such a fun conversation, though.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.840]   I hope I get a chance one day to smooth things over with Manu's wife.
