[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the parable, which we read together at the beginning,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   and which is to be found recorded in the Gospel according to St. Matthew in chapter 20,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   and the first 16 verses. Obviously we don't read the 16 verses again.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   But you remember that the parable starts in this way.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "For, because the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And then I want to remind you again particularly of the words from verse 14 to the end,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   or verse 13 perhaps, "But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Is thine I evil, because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   For many be called, but few chosen."
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Now, as we consider this parable, it is obviously quite essential that we should remind ourselves
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   of the circumstances in which our Lord ever came to speak the parable.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You will find generally that there is some reason which has led our Lord to utter a parable.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He always does so to enforce some particular point or principle of teaching.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And he does so very definitely in this particular instance.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   As I've just reminded you in reading the first verse again, it opens with the word "for".
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He's going to illustrate something. "For", he says, now listen.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And then he speaks the parable to illustrate a point.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And the context, the setting, of course, is that which we saw again in the reading at the beginning.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It started over the case of the so-called rich young ruler
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and his surprise at the result of his interview with our Lord.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And then it continued with the surprise of the disciples
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   at what our Lord had said to and had done with the rich young ruler.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And then it went on and became even worse by the question that was put by the apostle Peter.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   When turning to our Lord, he said, "Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   What shall we have therefore?"
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Now, our Lord clearly saw a very great and a very grievous danger in all these incidents.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   The case of the young ruler, the attitude of the disciples to him,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and still more serious, as I say, the attitude of the disciples towards themselves and their relationship to him,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   and their attitude in general to this whole question of salvation and a knowledge of God.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   In other words, our Lord, I am suggesting, saw in these combined incidents
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   an essential misunderstanding of the whole of the gospel,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   of his whole object and purpose in coming into the world, of the whole doctrine of salvation.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So, having answered the direct question of the apostle Peter,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   who asks now, "We've done this, that, and the other for you. What are we going to have?"
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Well, he answers him, and then having given an answer, he adds this, "But,"
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and he obviously says this quite deliberately,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He says that to shock Peter and the other disciples,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and to call their attention to this particular point about which he is so concerned.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And then, in order to make it abundantly plain and clear,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   he goes on and says as it were, "Now listen, I'll tell you exactly what I mean.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I can see that you're surprised at what I've just said to you,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   that many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Well, very well, listen to this.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Now, this kingdom of God and kingdom of heaven about which I'm speaking to you,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and which you've noticed is the very center and nerve of all my preaching and my teaching,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   you know, what characterizes that kingdom is this."
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And then he speaks his parable.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Now, it is always good to remember when we are dealing with a parable,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   that a parable generally has one big point only, and no more.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   The danger with a parable is that people try to find points and meaning
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and suggestions in every phrase and everything that's said.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   That's to turn a parable into an allegory, and is to do violence to it.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Parables are meant to bring out one big point, and that is true of this parable.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And therefore our business is to seek the central point of the parable,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and it is patently this.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   It is to illustrate and to show us how because of the character of the kingdom of God
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   or the kingdom of heaven, it comes to pass that many that are first shall be last,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   first. And you see at once how the parable does that.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Here it is, it's a picture, a story, of a man who was a householder,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and in addition to that a man who owned a fairly extensive vineyard.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And we are told that he went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And he met some men, and he agreed with them to do the work in his vineyard for a penny a day.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Now a penny doesn't mean what we mean by a penny.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   It was the recognized kind of wage for a day's work at that time.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And he agreed with these men to do the work for a penny a day.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And they agreed, and he sent them into his vineyard.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Then we are told he went out the third hour, saw others standing.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He said to them, "You go also to the vineyard."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And you notice this time there is no agreement.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   He simply says, "Whatsoever is right, I will give it you."
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And then he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and he did the same thing.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And then he went about the eleventh hour.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And he saw others standing idle, and he said to them, "Why stand you here idle all the day?"
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   They said, "Because nobody has hired us."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And he said to them, "You go also to the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, that shall you receive."
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So they went exactly as all the others had gone before him.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Now, here is the thing for us to lay hold on.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The division comes as between the first group of men that were sent to the vineyard and all the others.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   That's the point of the parable.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   In the case of the first group, there was an agreement.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   There was no agreement in the case of all the others.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So you can forget all about the third, the sixth, the ninth, and the eleventh hours, as it were.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   The big point of cleavage is between the first group and all the others.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And the difference is agreement in the first, no agreement with the remainder.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And then you remember how we come to the climax.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The end of the day came, and this man, this householder, called his steward and said,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   "Now call the laborers and give them their hire."
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And then you notice, beginning from the last unto the first.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   See, many that are first shall be last and last first.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So in the parable, he continues to work that out.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   "Go," he says, "and pay these men their hire. Start with the last and end with the first."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And do you remember what happened? He gave the last a penny.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And he gave the others a penny.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Then he came to the men who'd gone first.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And we are told of them that they supposed that they should have received every man a penny.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And they likewise received every man a penny.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And when they had received it, they murmured against the good men of the house, saying,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   "These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   which have borne the burden of the day and the heat in addition."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And he answered and said unto them, "To one of them, friend, I did thee no wrong, I do thee no wrong.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Didst thou not agree with me for a penny?" and so on.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Now then, there is the parable.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And you see the point and the purpose of the parable.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   What's it mean? What does it tell us?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Well, it tells us exactly what it was meant to tell the disciples in particular.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   What it was meant to say to everybody else who was listening on this occasion with the disciples.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   What is it?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Well, that there is a terrible danger of our completely misunderstanding the nature of the kingdom of God.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   The whole purpose of the coming of the Son of God into the world, the way of salvation.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   How to be right with God. That's the matter.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And I say it was because our Lord was patently alarmed at the stumbling of the apostles.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   He wasn't perhaps so surprised in the case of the rich young ruler,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   although we are told in one of the other accounts that looking upon him he loved him,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   and felt very sorry for him.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   But the disciples are stumbling.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   They don't understand this, and they're in trouble.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And so Peter asks his question, "We've done all this, what are you going to give us?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   What shall we receive?"
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Our Lord, I say, is disturbed.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And in order to save them from terrible error, he speaks his parable.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And I'm adverting to it tonight for the same reason.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   There are many people in the world tonight who are not Christians for one reason only.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And that is that they fall into this self-same trap,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   which the rich young ruler and the disciples and Peter were falling into.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   That's why they're not Christians.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   They're missing the blessings of God upon their lives.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   They're missing the glorious experience of the saints.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   They live a life of defeat and of unhappiness.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   They're afraid of death, and they often die in terror.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   They've got no hope as they look beyond death and the grave.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   They're missing it all, and the glory that awaits the children of God in eternity,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   simply because they've never understood the true nature of the kingdom of God,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   the way of salvation, the way of being reconciled to God
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and coming to know him and to be his children and to be blessed of him.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Very well. Now the parable is meant to enlighten such people.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So we can divide our matter up quite simply in this way.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   This parable obviously teaches us a number of points
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   concerning that one great central matter.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   What does it tell us?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Why did Allah trouble to tell this story?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Well, I say he did so in order to teach us the following things.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   First, the essential character of his gospel and of life in his kingdom,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   its essential character. I mean by essential character this.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   The gospel is something which is always surprising and unexpected.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Now that's the thing that comes out here everywhere, isn't it?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Look at this rich young ruler. He's been watching our Lord.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Before, you see, we come to his incident, the previous incident is one which tells us
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   that they brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And the disciples rebuked them.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   But Jesus said, "Suffer, little children, and forbid them not to come unto me,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And he laid his hands on them and departed thence.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And behold, one came unto him and said, "Master."
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   He'd been watching all this and he was attracted, interested, as they say today, intrigued.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   He'd never quite seen anything like this before.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   He was a good man, as you see, and a godly man, a religious man, and a very moral man.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   But here he sees something and he says, "Now, I want this something extra
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   that this extraordinary teacher seems to possess."
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So he came full of hope and of expectancy.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   But he went away sorrowful.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   He was shocked, he was surprised, he was amazed.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And so were the disciples.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They may have known the man, they may have known his story.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   They see this man, this excellent man of everybody, going away sorrowful.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And our Lord proceeds to say some extraordinary things.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Listen to him.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   "Verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter, hardly enter,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   into the kingdom of heaven with great difficulty.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Then I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And we are told when his disciples heard it,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   they were exceedingly amazed and said, "Who then can be saved?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   What are you talking about? The thing is impossible.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Who can be saved in the light of all this?"
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   But Jesus said, "Unto them with men this is impossible,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   but with God all things are possible."
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   You see, they were amazed.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   The rich young ruler was amazed.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   The disciples were amazed.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And then our Lord, quite deliberately, after the question of Peter
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   about what shall we have therefore in view of all we've done for you,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   he now deliberately shocks them.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   He hadn't been deliberately shocking them before, but now he does it deliberately.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   He says, "Listen, in this kingdom of mine,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first."
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   He's turning things upside down.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   He's shocking. It's unexpected. It's surprising.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It is amazing.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Now I start with that for this good reason.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   If you and I don't realize at the very beginning
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   that this kingdom of God is entirely and altogether different
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   from anything and everything we've ever heard of before,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   well, then we know nothing about it.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   We're just ignorant of it.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Shall I put it bluntly like this?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   If you've never known what it is to be surprised and amazed at the gospel,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   well, you've never heard the gospel.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   You don't know what it is.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   You see, when the gospel is presented as it was here by the Son of God,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   even the disciples are filled with amazement.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   This excellent, religious, moral young ruler was amazed and goes away sorrowful.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   He has the surprise of his life.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Has the gospel ever surprised you, my friend?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I'm asserting on the authority of the Son of God
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   that if it hasn't surprised us and amazed us and astounded us,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   we don't know it, we've never heard it.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Well, this is obviously very important
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   from the standpoint of our whole approach to it, isn't it?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   The Bible is full of this.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Listen to God saying the same thing through the prophet Isaiah
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   prophesying the coming of this gospel 800 years before.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   "My thoughts are not your thoughts,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   neither are my ways your ways, saith the Lord.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts and your thoughts."
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Altogether different, you see.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And as I say, the Bible is full of this.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   You get the accounts given in these gospels
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   of the announcement of the coming of the Son of God
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and Mary was amazed, couldn't believe it, couldn't understand it.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Everybody's surprised about this.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   It was a revolutionary thing.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And as they hear the gospel, you know, the famous question is this,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   "How can these things be?"
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Nicodemus said it.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Here again, you see, he's a great and a learned man,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   a highly religious man.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And he goes and seeks an interview with our Lord
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   and our Lord begins to speak to him.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And he's staggered, "How can these things be?"
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Our Lord had said, "You must be born again."
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And he said, "But how can a man be born when he's old?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb?"
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   How can these things be?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Surprised, astonished, amazed, staggered.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And so we read in the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   that when the apostles and others had gone around preaching,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   people began to talk about them like this.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   They said, "These men that have turned the world upside down
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   have come hither also."
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Turned the world upside down? Of course.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   What's it mean?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Well, it means this,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   that this gospel is unlike anything that's ever been heard in the world.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   First, last, last, first.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Seems to be no rhyme, no reason in it.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Can't understand it. Isn't logical.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Doesn't keep to the rules.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Isn't what we've always known.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Isn't what we've always expected.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And that is why you see many reject it.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   The Apostle Paul, in speaking to the Corinthians,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   tells them the thing very plainly.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   The Jews require a sign, the Greeks seek after wisdom.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But we preach Christ crucified.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And to the Jews, a stumbling block.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And to the Greeks, foolishness.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Why? Well, you see, it wasn't what they expected.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   It wasn't what they'd always thought.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Here were these Greek philosophers.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   They'd been working out an understanding of life
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   and trying to see cause and effect and working these things out.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And they were trying to go further and further to understand the ultimate mystery.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And their idea of a savior is one who takes them a step further than they'd arrived at.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   That was the rich young ruler's way.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   That was Nicodemus' idea.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   But he doesn't do that at all.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   He doesn't seem to do anything of the type and the kind that they imagine.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And so they're stumbled and offended.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   So were the Greeks. So were the Jews.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Their notion of their Messiah was that he'd be a great military personage
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   and that he'd come and gather a great army and conquer their enemies.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   But instead of that, he spends his time not in Jerusalem,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   but up in the north in Galilee,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   with just a crowd of ordinary people, a rabble, people who didn't matter.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   So they said, "If thou be the Son of God, why don't you go up to Jerusalem,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   declare yourself and be made king?"
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   His brothers taunted him, you remember.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Nobody could understand him.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   He doesn't do what they thought he'd do.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   They were amazed at him.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And therefore I say that this is the thing that we understand
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and must grasp at the very beginning.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is never what the natural man expects it to be.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And if your idea of the gospel has been until tonight
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   that it's just an extension of what you've got or of what you are,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   just an addition to what you are, well, then you're wrong.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   You're already wrong. There's no surprise in that.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   It's but an extension of your own position,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   and there's no amazement produced.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But here our Lord is deliberately indicating this fact that it's revolutionary,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   unlike anything else.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Man has never thought of it. He can't believe it.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   It seems strange. It seems folly to the wise.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It seems ludicrous, laughable.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   But such it is.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   "Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first."
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And so you notice in the parable, this surprise, these first people,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   when they saw the last getting a penny, they were already surprised.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And then everybody else gets a penny, no difference.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Then when they come to themselves, well, they thought this thing is impossible.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   They thought when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   but they didn't.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And they're amazed and astonished and annoyed.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Why? Well, it isn't as they thought it was going to be.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Oh, I must leave this point that I may hurry on to matters that are more important.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   But let me ask a simple question to somebody
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   who's in trouble about this whole business of Christianity.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   You say, "I'm not a Christian."
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I read about it, I listen to sermons, and I'd like to be a Christian,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   but I can't get it.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   What are you doing? Are you trying to understand it?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Are you approaching Christianity as if you were approaching Shakespeare,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   or politics, or social conditions, or any one of a number of other things?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Tell me.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Do you think that this is just one in a series of all the things you're interested in and are studying?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   If you do, you'll never get there, never.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Our Lord puts up this notice outside his kingdom.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   This is what he says to all, to men and women, young and old,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   learned and ignorant, brilliant minds, ignoramuses, dullards, the witless.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   He puts up the same notice, and they've all got to face it.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Here it is, "Except ye be converted, and become as little children."
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Little children.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   "Ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Have you felt the shock? Have you known it?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Have you been pulled up by it?
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Are you still trying to understand this gospel,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   getting it into your mind, into your system,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   trying to encompass it with your understanding?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   My dear friend, you might as well give up.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   You'll never do it.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   It'll shock you.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It'll keep tumbling you and shocking you for the rest of your life,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   and you'll always be seeking, and you'll die a seeker,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   and go out into outer darkness.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Don't try to understand this.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Give it up at once.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   It's the kingdom of God, not of men.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   This is God's wisdom, not human wisdom.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Therefore I say, give up a fruitless endeavor and attempt,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and become as a little child, and listen to what it's got to say.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Now then, that brings me to my second point, which is this.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   What the parable teaches us about a completely false view of salvation.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   That's the thing our Lord is dealing with in particular.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   The false view of salvation that was held by the rich young ruler,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   that Peter seems to be stumbling into once more,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and the first group of laborers in the parable.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Now then, what are we told?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Well, here are the characteristics of a false view of salvation.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   That's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I'm going to hold a false view of salvation before you.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   I'm going to then hold the true view of salvation before you.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   They're both depicted in the parable.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Listen, here are the characteristics of the false view.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And oh, may I plead with you in the name of God to examine yourself.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   What's your view of salvation?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   What's your view of Christianity?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   What's your view of being a child of God and a Christian?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   On what are you basing your hope of heaven and of eternity tonight?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   As you value your immortal soul,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   as you know you've got to die and meet God in the judgment,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I beseech you, examine yourself and your idea of salvation
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   in the light of this analysis.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Here are the characteristics of the wrong view of salvation.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   One, it regards salvation as a reward for merit.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Its view of salvation is that it's something that we earn
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and receive as the result of what we do.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Isn't it here everywhere? Rich young ruler.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   All these have I kept from my youth up.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Anything more? Tell me what it is, I'm ready to do it.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   He was told what it was, but he wasn't ready to do it.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Peter, now look here, we've given up all.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   What shall we have there for?
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Presenting a bill, you see.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And this first group of labourers in the vineyard.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   We've been working here throughout the day.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   We have toiled here.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   We've borne the burden and the heat of the day.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Is this all?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Now this, you see, is the first and the most terrible fallacy of all.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   That salvation is a reward given for services rendered.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Or if you prefer it in another way,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   it is the whole idea that we make ourselves Christians
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   by living a good life.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   By not doing certain things, by doing other things.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   We make ourselves Christians by going to church,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   by giving money to good causes,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   by giving a helping hand, by living a moral life.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And then because we've lived such a good life,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   now then we say, here, I've done it, let me have it.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Give me my reward, my salvation.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Let's put it like that then, simply and plainly.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   The first and the most tragic fallacy of all
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   is to think that we can make ourselves Christians
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   by doing this or that.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   By living a good life and refraining from evil and sin.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   That we've amassed such righteousness that God rewards us.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Is that your view?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Do you think you've made yourself a Christian?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Do you think that you are a Christian
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   because you're living a good life now
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   and because you have lived a good life
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   or because you're proposing to live a good life from tonight?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Are you basing your hope of heaven upon the life you've lived
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   and can say at the end, well, there's my life,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I didn't do terrible things, I never committed murder,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   I was never an adulterer, I never got drunk,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and I tried to do a lot of...
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Well, that's my hope, I've always tried.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Is that your position?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   It is, you see.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   You're in the position of the rich young ruler, of Peter,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   and of this first group of labourers in the vineyard.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   You have an agreement, you strike a bargain,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   you present a bill, and you expect God to honour it.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   That's the most fatal error of all.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   But come, let's see some further things about this false view.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   You notice that there is another thing
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that characterises people who hold this false view,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and that is that they never hesitate to stand up to God.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   When they make demands of God, and they grumble against God,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and they query and question His ways.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   These characteristics always go together.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   The people who think they make themselves Christians
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   are always people who are ready to criticise God and His ways.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   You see, we are told about this first group of labourers
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   that they murmured.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   When they received it, they murmured against the good men of the house.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Now, it's our Lord who spoke the parable.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   This isn't my teaching, it's Christ's teaching,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   and the good men of the house is God.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And they murmured against Him.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   They criticised Him, they queried Him, they questioned Him,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and they don't hesitate to do that.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's an appalling thing, this.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   But we know what it means, don't we?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   We've all done it at some time or another.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Why should God say this?
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   I don't think it's right of God.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   I don't think it's fair of God.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Criticising God!
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   It's always a characteristic of people who've got a wrong view of salvation.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   What's your attitude to God, my friend?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Do you sit in judgement on God,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and question and query and murmur and criticise and complain?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Oh, I say this is an appalling and a terrible thing.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   But it is a characteristic always of this false view of salvation.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Let's go to the third.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   The third is this.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   It is a view which always, and of necessity it seems to me,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   has no use at all for failures.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   It regards a man or a woman who's a failure in life
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   as utterly hopeless and deserving of nothing.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It has no sympathy for them, it has no mercy, it has no compassion.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   It's quite logical, of course.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   If I believe that I'm a Christian because I live a good life,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   well, when I look at a man or a woman who doesn't live a good life,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   they must, in my estimate, be quite hopeless.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   If I think I'm going to heaven because I've lived a good life,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   well, I say automatically and logically,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   they have no right to expect to go to heaven.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   What have they done about it?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   They've ignored it, they've lived a life of evil and of sin.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   They've sown, they've made their own bed, let them lie in it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   It's quite logical, isn't it?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Indeed, it must follow of necessity from the first proposition.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And so these people, you see, were very annoyed
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   when they found the last being given a penny.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Why? They said they've done nothing.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   They haven't borne the burden and the heat of the day.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   They've rendered you no service.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Look at the way you're treating them. This is wrong.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   These men, look how you're treating them.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   They spoke of them with contempt.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   What is your attitude, my friend, to men and women
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   who are living immoral and evil and foul and filthy lives?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   How do you figure out their position?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   What's going to happen to them, you think?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   What hope is there for them?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Where do they come in your scheme?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   You are good, you're moral, you're religious,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   you're living to do good works.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And you say that's it, that's going to please God
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   and He's going to reward me.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Now then, I say before your view of salvation is complete,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   you've got to answer me this question.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   What of the people who are doing the exact opposite to you?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   What have you got to say to them?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Oh, you say I'm going to tell them to pull themselves together.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   All right, let's think of the men in his eighties
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   who's always lived that evil, foul life,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   and he's going to die before midnight this evening.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   What have you got to say to him?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   The doctors have agreed in the hospital
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   he can't live till midnight.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   He's lived an evil, foul life all his life.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   What have you got to give him?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   You who say that a man makes himself a Christian,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   you who say that heaven is the reward of a good life lived,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   of morality and religion and so on.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   What have you got to say to these men?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   On your standing and on your argument,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   you've got nothing.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   He's hopeless.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   There's nothing for him but hell.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   No hope at all.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   He's left it till the eleventh hour.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   He's outside, he must remain there.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He deserves to be there.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   So I go on to the next, which is this.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   These people with the wrong view of salvation,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   like these first labourers in the parable,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   always feel that the New Testament and Christian way of salvation
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   is not only wrong, but that it is immoral.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   These lost have wrought but one hour,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and thou hast made them equal unto us,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   which have borne the burden and the heat of the day.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   What does it mean?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It means this.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   They say you're acting in an immoral manner.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   What you're doing is not right.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   It's actually wrong.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   It's unjust.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   They said that because God treated them all alike
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   and gave the penny to the last as he did to the first.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   They're offended.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   They're annoyed.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   So the Master says to them,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Is thine eye evil because I'm generous?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Why are you looking blackly and darkly at me
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and frowning and murmuring?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Why do you say that I'm wrong and unfair and immoral in my action?"
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   But you know that's what these people still say.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   I heard some clever men, when was it, just over a year ago,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   you know, on this famous brain trust.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   One of them, with a pipe in his mouth,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   said he thought that this whole notion, you see,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   of atonement and of another dying for our sins,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   he said, "Of course, it's just surely immoral, immoral."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   That's what he called it,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   exactly like these people here in the parable.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   He said this idea that it doesn't matter how a man has lived,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   that he's given salvation at the end as a free gift,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   as if he deserved as much as the man who spent a lifetime
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   in forsaking delights and living laborious ways,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   a man who has given himself and curbed himself and disciplined himself
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   to say that this wretch, who in a moment of repentance at the end,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   is given everything like the first man he said it's sure downright immoral.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Exactly what these people said.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   But my dear friend, I'm concerned about you.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   We are preaching a gospel which says that Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   That salvation is a free gift because Christ,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   the Son of God, has borne our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   and that whosoever believeth in him, whether he sinned for eighty years
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   or is a young man, receives the same gift exactly, salvation freely.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Do you say that's immoral? Do you say it's unethical?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Do you say that it cuts at the whole basis of your moral system
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   and all your educational programs?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   That's what the clever men said on the brains trust and they were unanimous.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   That's what the world is saying tonight.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   This is downright immoral. It's encouraging men to sin.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   It's inciting them to moral laxity and looseness.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Is that your view?
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Do you feel it's unjust, that it's unethical, and that it is indeed even immoral?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   That's another characteristic of the false view.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Let me hurry to the fifth point.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Ah, the fifth point about this wrong view
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   is that it misses the whole glory of the way of salvation.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   They murmured, of course they did.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   They didn't sing, they didn't rejoice, they didn't praise God.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Well, how could they?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   They were prim, self-satisfied, legal, formal.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   "We've done this. Why don't we get more?"
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   There's no song in their hearts, there's no rejoicing.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   "Oh, I must hurry on."
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Tell me, my dear friend,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   does your view of the gospel make you sing
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   glorious things of the unspoken?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Come, thou fount of every blessing,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   kill my heart to sing thy praise, all thy grace.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Did you mean it when you sang it?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   When all thy mercies, oh my God,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   my rising soul surveys.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   When I behold the wondrous cross
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   on which the Prince of Glory died.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Do you mean it?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Love so amazing, so divine,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   demands my soul, my life, my all.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   my great Redeemer's praise.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Have you felt that?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Well, how can you feel it if you feel you've made yourself a Christian?
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   If you feel that you're a Christian because of the good life you've lived
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and that you're going to heaven because of your excellencies and abilities
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and your moralities and your religiosity.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Can you? You can't. You don't sing.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   These men murmured.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   So do all such people, finally.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   There's nothing to sing about.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Oh, how tragic this is.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Yes, and it leads to a tragic end.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   You noticed the end of these labourers,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   these first labourers, didn't you?
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Their end was disappointment.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Murmuring and disappointment.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   They supposed that they would have received more.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   But they didn't.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And they were disappointed and unhappy and denied and dejected.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   It's a terrible thing to have to say,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   but I say it on the authority of the Son of God.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   If you think that you make yourself a Christian,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   if you think that God's going to open the gates of heaven to you
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   because you've lived a good life
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   and have always given yourself to good works and morality and so on,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   you are supposing, aren't you, like these men,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   that you're going to receive a wonderful reward.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   But I tell you in the name of the Son of God that you won't.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   You will be disappointed.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   You will find that your whole outlook,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   your whole thinking has been completely wrong.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And I'll tell you something still more terrible.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You will be sent away by him as these people were sent away.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   You know, these words are not translated as strongly as they could.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   We read in verse 13,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   "But he answered one of them and said,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   'Friend, I do thee no wrong.'"
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   He should have said this.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   He didn't call him friend.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   "Comrade, man, I do thee no wrong."
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   "It's no, not agree with me for a penny."
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Then take this phrase.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   "Take that thine is and go thy way."
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   It's a dismissal.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   It was said severely.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "Take up that penny.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Away!
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Get out of my sight.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   You're all wrong with your murmuring and your grumbling.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Go away."
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Indeed, our Lord put this explicitly in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   He depicts the same sort of person there in chapter 7.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   "And they are going to say to him,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   'Lord, Lord, have we not done this, that, and the other in thy name?'
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Cast out devils and so forth.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   But I will say unto them,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   'I never knew you.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Depart from me.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Get away, ye that work iniquity.'"
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   The end of that false view is always disappointment.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   It is always unhappiness.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   "About such people our Lord said,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   'Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   they get the reward.'"
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Of course.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   The reward is to think they're good people.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And other people say so.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   "They're praised very much by men.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Ye are they that justify yourselves before men," says Christ.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   "But God seeth the heart.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   For that which is highly esteemed amongst men
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   is abomination in the sight of God."
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   they get the reward."
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Oh, they'll get a good obituary notice.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Wonderful worker, this.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Highly moral person, good person, this.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   They get the reward, but that's all they get.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   That's what it means.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   They'll get no more.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   They get everything in this world.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   In the next world, nothing but disappointment and unhappiness.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Dismissal.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Let us turn to the true view of salvation.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And oh, thank God that we can turn
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   from that miserable, cramped, self-righteous,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   hard, legal view of God and of Christianity.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Look at the other, my dear friend.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Listen to it.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   It's something that I can put to you
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   in terms of the view a man takes of God.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Here are the tests of a true view of salvation.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   First, the man who is truly Christian
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   is a man who's got the right view
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   of the sovereign lordship of God.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Listen to our Lord putting it.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   He says, "Is it not lawful for me
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   to do what I will with mine own?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   I am the Lord.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I am absolutely free.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   I have a right to do what I like.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   I needn't have sent you into the vineyard.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   I needn't have sent anybody else.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I can do absolutely what I like and what I please.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   I am the master.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I am the Lord."
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   That's his way of telling us about God.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   I can tell you very easily
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   whether a man's a Christian or not.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Now, what I want to know about him
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   is what's his view of God.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   If he's always standing up and saying,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   "No, I don't agree with this.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I don't think it's right.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I don't think it's fair.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Is it fair that one save one not?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   These are the questions they ask.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Is it right that that man's brought in at the end
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   and in the same position as the man who was there all his--
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I don't see that.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's all right.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   You needn't say no more.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   I know that you're not a Christian."
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   A Christian never speaks like that about God.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Because he is a Christian,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   he has been brought into relationship with God,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   and he knows God.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And he knows that God is the almighty creator,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   the creator of the ends of the earth.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   He knows that he is absolute and illimitable
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   in all his power and in his glory.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   He knows that he's the ruler of the universe
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   and the judge of the universe
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and the judge of the whole world.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   He knows that everything and everybody,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   himself included,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   is in the hands of God,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   and he humbles himself before him.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   The first thing that is true of a Christian is this,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   that far from presenting his bill and his account
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   and asking for payment,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   he's surprised that there is such a thing as salvation at all.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   He's so aware of the sin in himself and in others
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and in the whole world,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   he says, "You know what I can't understand is this.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Why has God not destroyed the whole world long ago?"
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   You see, the other people say,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   "Why does God allow war?"
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   "Ah," says this man,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   "the amazing thing to me is that God ever gives us peace.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Why does God allow these things to happen?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Why doesn't God smite every one of us?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   We deserve nothing from him."
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   That's the speech of the Christian.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   What amazes the Christian is not that some people are not saved,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   but that anybody is saved.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   He sees that nobody has a right to be saved,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   that God made us and that we are ourselves,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   and God has a right to do as he wills with us,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   and the Christian humbles himself before him.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   He says, "He's the Lord. He's God.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   We deserve nothing.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   If he damned the whole world,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   I wouldn't be able to murmur for a second.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   I've forgotten God.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   I've taken his gifts and I haven't thanked him."
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Then when I lost my health,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I began to grumble and said,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   "Why does God allow this to happen to me?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Somebody's taken desperately ill.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   A child dies."
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I say, "Is this fair?"
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   "Oh, no, no."
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   I say, "The amazing thing is that God has ever blessed me at all.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   I've been such a cad.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   I've been so selfish.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   I've been so vile.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   I've gone to God when I needed him,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and then when I haven't, I've forgotten him.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   I've lived for myself.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I've been selfish and self-centered.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Have I not a right to do as I will with mine own?"
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   "You have," says the Christian.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   "And I don't come presenting a bill.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   I come as a pauper,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   casting myself upon your mercy
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   and humbling myself in your presence."
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   That's the Christian's view of God's lordship and sovereignty.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Not that he has a right to salvation.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Nobody has a right.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Nobody grants that God would be justified
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   if he condemned the whole world to hell.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   In other words, this man is a true view
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   in the second place of the justice of God.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   He answered one of them and said,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   "Friend, I do thee no wrong."
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   "What are you murmuring about?"
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   "Didst thou not agree with me for a penny?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   You say that I'm unfair, that I'm unjust.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Wait a minute," says this man.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   "Let's argue it out together.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Where is the injustice?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Where have I been unfair?"
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Look at the justice of God as you see it
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   in the case of his dealing with people
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   who strike a bargain with him
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   and who present a bill to him.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Is it unjust?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   If they've agreed with a penny and are given a penny,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   where is the injustice?
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   There is none.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Which I want to put to you in this way.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Do you say that your view of salvation
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   is this, that a man stands on his own feet
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   and that salvation is the result of his good life
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   and all his efforts?
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Do you say, "I believe in morality
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   and in my own good works,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   and I say that I want to be judged
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   in terms of what I am,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   not my supposed faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   I stand on my own legs."
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   "Very well," says God,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   "if those are your terms, all right,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   I'll take you on your own terms."
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   You say you want to be judged on your own life
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   and on your own activities
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   and on your own works.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   "Very well, I'll agree."
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   And when you come to stand in the presence of God,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   this is what will happen to you.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   You will say, "I've lived my life
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   to try and please you,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and that's why I claim my right to eternal life."
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   And God will call upon somebody
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   to read the Ten Commandments.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And you'll be told,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   "Well, those are the terms you've chosen.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   You shall be judged by them."
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   Let's take the summary given by Jesus Christ himself.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   This is the law.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   with all thy heart and all thy soul
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   and all thy mind and all thy strength."
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   That's number one.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Number two,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   That's what God wants.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   You say, "I'm going to stand on my own feet.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   I believe its actions and how a man lives."
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   "Very well," says God,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   "I'll strike the bargain.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   I'll take you on your own terms."
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   That's what you claimed.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   That's what you stood on,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   what you say.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And then the Sermon on the Mount
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   and the life of Christ.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Those are the terms.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And the moment you are judged by such standards,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   you see what happens.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   You are condemned.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   You haven't a leg to stand on.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   That's what you know to be true of yourself.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   You have not lived for God.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   You have not loved Him the whole of your being.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   You have not loved your neighbor as yourself.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   You despise this man who is in the gutter tonight.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   You turn away from him and say,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   "What horrible creatures.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   What filth.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   What foulness."
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   You haven't loved your neighbor as yourself.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   You haven't loved your enemies.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   No, no.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   You've done none of these things.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   So if you stand on those grounds,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   you see the inevitable conclusion, don't you?
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   You stand self-condemned.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   And you go to hell.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And you won't have any complaint to make.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   You've been given your own terms.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   You've been accepted on your own proposition.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   You said you wouldn't have anything else.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   This is what you felt was manly.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   This is what you believed in.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Very well, says God.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   And you know in hell you'll have to grant that He's right.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   That He was perfectly just.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   That there's been no unfairness and no injustice.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   You said, "I'll do it for a penny."
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   And you'll be given your penny.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   You'll have had strict justice.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   But it is a justice that consigns you to eternal misery.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   God's ways are always just to the Christian.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   He's just in His condemnation.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   You say, "I don't believe in hell."
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Don't you?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   That's because you don't understand what justice means.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   That's because you've gone back on your own contract.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   That's because you don't carry out what you said at the beginning.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Like these men in the parable.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   If you want strict justice, you'll get it.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   And you'll spend an eternity in hell murmuring.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   But you'll have no case and you'll know it in your heart.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   As Divies knew it, according to our Lord,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   in His parable of Divies and Lazarus.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   God's always just in all His ways.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Not only with the people with whom He strikes a bargain with Him,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   but He's equally just in His grace.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Is He right in giving this last man a penny like the first?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Of course He is.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   God's way of grace honors the law.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   "We don't make void the law," says Paul in Romans 3.31.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   "Yea, we establish the law."
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   How do you do that?
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   You say, "But how can you say that?"
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Is it just and right in God to forgive a man that sinned all his life
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   and say that He saved and that He's His Son and He goes into heaven?
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Is it justice?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Where is God's righteous punishment of sin?
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   It's a good question, but I've got a good answer.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   God has punished the sin.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   How has He punished the sin?
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Oh, He punished it by putting it on His own Son.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   The law has been fully honored.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   God does punish sin.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   He punishes the sin of every sinner that becomes a saint.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   But He punishes them in the person of His own Son.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Every sin has been accounted for.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Justice has been satisfied.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   The sword came down.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   Christ died for our sins.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Always just, you see.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Never unrighteous.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   Had you seen that about this gospel?
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   But let me say just a word about the last point, which is this.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Did you notice how the Lord put it to this man?
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   He said, "Is it not awful for me to do what I will with mine own?"
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Then listen to this.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   "Is thine eye evil because I am good?"
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   says this authorized translation.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   But, you know, it's not a good translation.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   Here's the real translation.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   "Is thine eye evil?"
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Are you put out of joint?
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Are you murmuring and complaining?
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   "Because I'm generous."
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   That's it.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   "Because I'm generous."
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   This last man didn't deserve a penny.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   I gave him a penny.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   I've been generous to him.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Oh, this is the thing that the man who's a true Christian sees about God's way of salvation.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   The generosity of God.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   The grace of God.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   The mercy, the compassion, the love.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Look at it.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   It's everywhere in the parable.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   Look at this man going out at the eleventh hour.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   He knew that a man couldn't do much work in an hour.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   He knew they wouldn't be worth anything.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   But he went out and sought them.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   And he found them still unemployed.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   And he said, "Why are you standing here?"
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   They said, "No man's employed us."
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   "Go," he says.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   "Go to the vineyard.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   I'll give you what's right and fair."
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Oh, this is the grace and the generosity of God that He bothers with us at all.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Though we've sinned against Him.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Though we've squandered our life.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Though we've lived a life of sin and wretchedness and evil.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   He comes after us.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   He goes out after us.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   He sent His Son to seek and to save that which was lost.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   The generosity of God.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   He seeks the vile that deserves nothing.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   The lazy.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   The indolent.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   The hopeless.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   The immoral.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   The unjust.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   The generosity of God.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Why did He send His Son into the world?
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Was it because the world was good?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Was it because He saw something beautiful in us?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   You know it wasn't.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   It was nothing in us.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   It was in spite of us.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Moved by His own eternal everlasting love.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   God so loved the world.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   That in spite of us and all that is so true of us.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   His generosity.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   And look at the way He did it.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   In His Son.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   His Beloved.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   He has only begun.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   The Son of His own bosom.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   His own essence and being.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   He sent Him forth.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   And not merely did He send Him into the world to teach and preach.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   He sent Him even to the cross.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   And laid our sins upon Him.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And struck Him and smote Him.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   That our sins might be borne by Him.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   And punished that He might forgive us.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   Oh, the generosity of God.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   That sends His only Son.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   And didn't spare Him.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   He that spared not His own Son.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   He punished your sin in Him to the uttermost.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   He spared Him nothing.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   He knew the agony of hell.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   And eternal hell at that.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   He bore it all.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   There is the generosity of God.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Does it move your heart?
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Or do you feel it's immoral?
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   That it's unethical and that it isn't right?
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Which is it?
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   This is the Christian view.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   And then think of what He gives us so freely.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Pardon and forgiveness.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Though you may have sinned the whole of your life.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Until you came into this chapel tonight.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Do you know I'm here to tell you.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   That if you repent and believe in this way.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Now you'll get immediate forgiveness.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   I'm not going to send you home to live a better life.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   No, that's the error you see.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   I'm telling you that you can have it now.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   You're forgiven for nothing.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   What do you say?
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Though I've blasphemed God.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Though I've ridiculed Christ.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Though I've lived a life of sin.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   I say that you've committed every sin that you can ever think of.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   And have touched the depths of iniquity and vileness.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   You can be forgiven now.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   Without a second's delay.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   But not only pardon and forgiveness.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   A new life.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   A new nature.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   A new start.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   A new beginning.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Become a child of God.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Clothed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Like people who've always been brought up in religion.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   And have always been good and moral.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   You'll be put into exactly the same position.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   With the same robe.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   The same everything.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   At once.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   You know I feel sorry for these people.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Is thine eye evil because I'm generous?
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Isn't your heart melted at the generosity of God in Christ?
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   My dear friend, if it isn't, you needn't talk about Christianity.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   You know nothing about it.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   You don't know the first thing about it.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   This is it.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   All the gift of God.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   All for nothing.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Nothing deserved.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   No bill presented.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Just as we are.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   There it is.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   So I end on this note.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   What has this parable got to say to us?
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   Well, isn't it obvious?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Instead of being like that first group of laborers, let us be like all the others.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   This was what they did, you remember.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   The first group wanted an agreement.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   They wanted to strike a bargain.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   And the master agreed and did so.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   But did you notice that in the case of all the others, this is what he told them?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   He didn't tell them what he was going to give them.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   He said, "Go and I'll give you that which is right, that which is fair."
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   And they took him at his word and they went.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Every one of them.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Do the same thing, my friend.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Throw away your ledgers and your books.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Stop keeping accounts.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Stop noting and totaling up your good deeds and your good works and your moralities.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Throw them away once and forever.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Stop making bargains with God.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Submit yourself to him utterly and entirely.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   If you've heard his call tonight, if you've heard his voice calling you and saying,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   "Go into my vineyard, get up and go."
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Don't say, "But now what if I do this, what shall I have for that?"
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   Stop, just go.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   Hear the voice, he's calling you.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   Go, go, submit to him.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Leave everything in his hands.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   And you will find that he will deal with you as our Lord depicts it in the parable.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   You'll have the surprise of your life.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   He'll shower his blessing upon you.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   And you'll know yourself to be a child of God and an heir of everlasting bliss.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Amen.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
