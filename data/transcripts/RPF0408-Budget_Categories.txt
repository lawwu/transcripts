[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.460]   After all, budgeting is essential at every stage of wealth. Today I'm going to share
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.380]   with you some specific tactics, including even the categories that I use for my own
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.380]   personal budget.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.800]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to serving you with the knowledge,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.880]   skills, insight, and consistent daily encouragement that you need to live a rich and meaningful
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   life now while working on your plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.320]   Sheets and I'm your host. Thank you for being with me today. Today we're going to
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.640]   be very, very practical. Yesterday's show was a little bit about big picture, RVs and
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   all that. Today, let's teach you how to budget for an RV or anything else that you want.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   As we begin the new year, I hope that many of you are taking a fresh look and fresh,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.160]   dedicating yourselves afresh to the nuts and bolts of finance. It's important to always
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.480]   remember that as fun as it is to think about new subjects and as fun as it is to learn
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.120]   about new ideas, oftentimes those ideas are more interesting than they are useful and
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.760]   practical.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.320]   Although I'm a huge fan of interesting and even esoteric ideas, I want to stay practical
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   because the fundamentals of finance are always, always important and you need to consistently
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.360]   execute on them in order for you to be able to accomplish your goals. The basic fundamental
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.920]   skill that you need to build wealth is the skill of budgeting. If you are not excellent
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   at your budgeting, no matter how much or how little you earn, you will wind up spending
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.620]   all of it. And because you wind up spending all of it, you'll be in a situation where
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.320]   it's unlikely for you to be able to build wealth.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.800]   Remember there are three things that are instrumental in your wealth building journey. Your income,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   the level of it, how high, how low, your expenses, how high and how low, and your investments.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.400]   But in order to manage your income and your expenses, you need a budget. Now, I have talked
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   in many shows about budgeting and I've talked about different approaches for budgeting.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.360]   Budgeting is one of the most freeing things in the world and I can't do any better than
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.220]   – I don't know who to ascribe it to, but I can't do any better than the saying that
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.200]   often goes around the personal finance world that a budget is simply telling your money
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.160]   where to go instead of wondering where it went. If I knew who originated that phrase,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.200]   I'd give them credit, but I don't. But that's really it.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   Now the cool thing about budgeting is that you get to decide the budget. You don't
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.960]   have to accept somebody else's budget. You get to decide. And budgeting is so exciting
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   because it's going to be reflective when done properly. It's going to be reflective
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   of your goals. That's what budgeting should be. Budgeting is a way of your getting to
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:30.540]   your goals. If you want something, you can budget for it. You get to decide what you
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.940]   want and then you get to figure out how to budget your way there. Budgeting is so, so
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.760]   powerful.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.260]   Now in today's show, I'm going to tell you a little bit of my mindset and specifically
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.740]   how I categorize my budget accounts. And there are many ways that you can use a budget, some
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.740]   of them more effective than others. For the sake of simplicity, you can budget using a
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.440]   piece of paper and a calculator. You don't even need a calculator if you paid attention
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.220]   and practiced your addition and subtraction tables such that you can do that manually.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.580]   A piece of paper is really all you need. You can budget using the old favorite of an envelope
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.860]   system where you budget using cash and envelopes for all of your spending. That's great. You
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.220]   can budget using any number of a suite of software options that are available. You can
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.580]   use Quicken. You can use Microsoft Money. You can use all kinds of online options. There's
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.540]   Mint. There's Personal Capital. There's all kinds of tools. There are dozens and dozens
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.060]   of them. There are apps that you can get for your smartphone. You can use spreadsheets.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.940]   I've done an interview with Peter Polson from Tiller. Tiller is a great option. I know many
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.380]   of you are using that, using Google Spreadsheets and automatically importing your data into
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.540]   that. You can do it in Excel. I've budgeted for years using Excel.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.180]   I don't care about the method. I'm going to share with you the categories that I use.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.100]   I think these categories are helpful. I use YNAB. If you are interested, go back and listen
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.620]   to some of the past episodes of the show. Go and listen to number 246 if you want to
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.380]   hear a little bit of my story with budgeting. That episode was called "You Need a Budget
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.660]   and Here's the Best Way for You to Make One." That was an interview with Jesse Mecham, who
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.820]   is the founder of YNAB. I use YNAB because it's just simple and it works really well.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.700]   It works with how my brain works. It does for me the two major functions that I want
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:35.260]   to have done in a budgeting system, which are tracking and budgeting. Again, tracking
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:42.860]   and budgeting. Big difference between these two things. There are many ways for you to
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:51.700]   track your money, to simply create a spreadsheet or an accounting of where it went. Almost
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.540]   all budgeting tools will do this well. For example, years ago I used Microsoft Money.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.540]   Microsoft Money does a great job with this. Quicken does a great job with this. Spreadsheets
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:08.700]   do a great job with this, of tracking where the money went. Here at the beginning of 2017,
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.740]   an exercise I strongly encourage you to engage in is to do a complete review of all of your
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:25.060]   expenditures of 2016. Do this complete review based on categories. Go back and think about
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.380]   what you did, what you spent, and make sure that these categories are reflective of your
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:37.820]   goals and of your values. That's very important. Do that review. But that's all a tracking
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:44.500]   function. A budgeting function is a way for you to allocate the resources that you now
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:53.780]   have in an appropriate manner so that at the end of 2017, you'll be in a position that
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:08:01.680]   is closer to your goals than farther away. A budgeting function is a way of using the
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:09.420]   resources you have and properly allocating those resources. And it's most valuable if
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:15.060]   this can be done in a flexible way. Now, if you want more philosophy on budgeting, go
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.860]   to radcopersonalfinance.com/archive and just search that page for budget. You'll find all
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:25.700]   kinds of past shows about budgeting. But today I'm going to tell you how I approach mine.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:31.080]   Now again, I use YNAB. And here's what I do. I keep two different budgets, two completely
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.580]   separate accounts disconnected. And the reason I do this is because I want to have a different
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:44.500]   mindset depending on which of those budgeting activities I'm engaged in. I keep one budget
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:53.900]   for business and one budget for personal. As a business owner, all of my revenue comes
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.540]   in under the category of business. Now, of course, my revenue is derived from various
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.900]   lines of business, various types of business activities, but it all comes in under the
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:11.220]   characterization of business. At this stage of my entrepreneurial journey, I can keep
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.620]   it this simple. Perhaps at a later stage, I will need to do what many of you will do,
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.700]   which will be have complete separate budgeting systems for each of your businesses that are
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.660]   completely distinct. Your bookkeeper, your accounting team will maintain those and you'll
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.500]   just simply review the reports for each of those. But I'm not in that stage myself yet.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.580]   So I maintain all of my business activities under one simple budget called business. Then
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:42.580]   I maintain all of my personal activities under one simple category called personal. Now,
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:51.780]   little tip for you. If you only have employment income, in the United States, this would be
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:59.020]   only income that's reflected on a W-2, tax income verification form. If you only have
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.380]   income that's reflected of your work as an employee, then you can maintain a simple personal
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:14.260]   budget. But you probably shouldn't only have employment income. You probably should have
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:23.320]   your own version of a business/investment budget and a personal budget. Almost each
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:30.220]   person should have some kind of side business that's related to your career, that's related
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.580]   to the career that you're moving towards, or that's related to an additional way for
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.860]   you to earn money. And so you can emulate and copy my approach of having a business
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.100]   budget and a personal budget. Now, the reason I keep these separate is because I want to
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.620]   have a different mindset in each of these. First of all, I want to be clear to myself
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:56.900]   that whenever possible, I want to have as few expenditures in the personal budget as
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:03.900]   compared to the business budget. I want to constantly keep in front of myself the idea
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:11.620]   that if possible, I want to associate any expenses with the business with the business.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:17.460]   And I don't want to forget about those expenses. Having done a significant amount of budget
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.260]   consulting with just normal people who are just getting started in business or even who've
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:29.520]   been established for a few years, one of the biggest errors that I find is they don't maintain
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.180]   separate business accounts, business records, and business books. Rather, they keep everything
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:42.900]   integrated. And friends, if you are doing that, I hate to make dogmatic statements when
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.620]   they are uncalled for, but man, I can't think of a single circumstance in which you're not
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:56.340]   wrong for doing that. If you're running a business or have some sort of business activity,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:03.980]   you must maintain separate records because you are walking past all kinds of important
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.980]   business tax deductions because you're not accustomed to paying attention to the little
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:16.420]   things. And if you have a separate business budget, you're almost automatically, you can't
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.100]   maintain a separate business budget unless you have a separate business checking account.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.860]   And if you have a separate business checking account and you do as I do where you have
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.220]   two debit cards sitting in your wallet, one is for business, one is for personal, if you
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:34.420]   do that, then you'll be in a situation to where you're paying attention to your expenditures.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.460]   Now, point of clarification for those of you who are just getting started, to have a separate
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:47.380]   business checking account does not require you to actually sign up for a business checking
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:55.720]   account. All you need is a separate checking account which you mentally classify as a business
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:02.820]   account. I hold in my hands my wallet and here I have two blue debit cards that are
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:09.660]   right in the front of my wallet. I bank with USAA so these have pretty blue, they're pretty
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.220]   blue and they've got this military star on them and a red line down them and they're
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.400]   identical. They are absolutely identical and the reason they're identical is because I
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:25.420]   use personal checking accounts. I just have two of them. One is for me and the other is
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:32.740]   for my business but they both are registered as Joshua J. Sheets. To differentiate the
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.780]   cards, you can draw on them with a marker. I've done that. I actually use this little
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:42.540]   engraving tool that I use to engrave all of my items. It's a little metal tip and I can
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:48.260]   write on metal and on plastic so I have here business scrawled on the front of it and so
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.660]   that way I always know which is which and I just carry these two debit cards right in
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.500]   my wallet and if it's a business expense, I swipe the business one and if it's a personal
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.540]   expense, I swipe the personal one. But this simple practice, if you just did that this
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:06.900]   year, many of you would save you hundreds or thousands of dollars because it will start
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:13.620]   to get your mindset thinking differently. Very simple example, you might go to lunch
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:20.280]   with somebody and if you go to lunch with somebody, then you might be tempted to pay
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:26.380]   for their lunch. That would be a good idea. But if you don't have that business debit
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.300]   card right there or business credit card, you can do the same thing with a credit card.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.260]   If you don't have that business card right there, you may not remember that that's a
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:40.580]   properly deductible business expense. You can deduct 50% of your meals and entertainment
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:47.740]   expenses when you are engaged in business-related meals and entertainment with clients, prospective
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.960]   clients, etc. And so if you're there with somebody talking about your business, don't
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:03.820]   let the lack of that business card keep you from the tax deduction that you are rightfully
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:11.020]   entitled to. Just a simple example, but man, I tell you, I see this all the time. Now,
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.620]   that's the first reason I like to keep two different, well, that's the first reason on
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.820]   my list here of why I like to keep two different budgets, simply that it keeps you in the mindset
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:24.780]   of thinking, "Is there a way that I can move some of these expenses that are personal and
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:32.740]   non-deductible over to the business expense column?" Here's the simple answer. If you're
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:41.420]   wondering if you can deduct something, it comes down to this. If the expense is related
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:48.660]   to the ordinary and necessary expense that's related to your business activities, it is
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.340]   a deductible activity. Now, of course, you can go and research with greater specificity
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:16:00.020]   any particular category, but that's basically the doctrine. All ordinary and necessary business
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:07.820]   expenses that are related to your business will be deductible in some form or another.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:13.300]   But another reason why I like to have the two categories separated is just simply so
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:19.020]   that I can have different mindsets when I'm looking at them. For example, with the personal
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.420]   category, which I'll go over my budget categories for you, with some categories I want to look
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.620]   at them and say, "I want to be ruthless and get these categories expenditures as low as
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:35.900]   possible." With some category expenses, I want to have a more moderate mindset. Good
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.940]   example, personal, let's say, consumption items that are not related that don't bring
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.820]   me pleasure. Well, I want to look at those items on my personal budget. I want to be
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:51.940]   as ruthless as possible about lowering those expenses. But personal category items that
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.100]   are quality of life expenses, let's say that it involves something I want to do with my
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.420]   family, building family memories, vacation expenses, things like that. I'm not necessarily
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.820]   trying to say, "How ruthless can I be and how low can I get that?" I'm trying to say,
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.860]   "How can I get maximum value for the money?" If it were a goal for me not to spend any
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.900]   money in this particular category, then I would just not go on vacation. But the goal
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.860]   is a quality of life goal. And so I want to look at that with a little bit more balance.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:26.300]   Now on the business side, if I want to look at a category that's simply an expense, I
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.340]   want to ask myself, "Is this an expense that's generating revenue or is this an expense that's
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:38.340]   just simply taking money out? It's just necessary." I want to be absolutely ruthless with the
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.780]   expenditures that are just necessary and I can't really get out of them and they're not
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:49.420]   generating any revenue. Perhaps an example would be fees or business licensing costs,
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.980]   things like that. Got to do them. How can I get out of them? But they're not generating
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.540]   revenue. They're useless to me. Now that's different than an expense that might be a
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.940]   revenue generation tool. And in business, I want to look carefully at those expenditures
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:08.180]   that are generating revenue and not necessarily diminish them. I probably want to maximize
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.660]   them. And I want to rank them in order of what's the most productive use of money to
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.780]   the least productive. I want to do my best to calculate how productive this particular
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   category is. But I want to spend money pretty freely on anything that's bringing me customers.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:36.060]   I might even want to invest heavily a significant amount of my profits into an area that's bringing
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.500]   me customers. The most obvious example here would be an advertising campaign. Let's say
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:48.220]   that you have a consistent way which through the use of advertising, you can bring new
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:56.100]   customers into your business. Well, if you have that and if the lifetime value of the
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.900]   customer is substantially higher than the cost of acquisition of that customer, then
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.900]   you are well served to put as much money into that advertising campaign or those advertising
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:13.980]   projects as that category will bear. Don't pull back based upon some kind of idea that
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.900]   I'm going to be frugal here. Being frugal with an advertising strategy that produces
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:25.660]   consistently high results is the wrong solution. And interestingly, in order to do this is
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.020]   I'll point out some of the business metrics that you need to actually be aware of. Let
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:35.580]   me give you a very simple but very powerful example. Let's say that the average transaction
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:43.420]   between you and your customer, the first transaction with a customer is $30. Okay, they're going
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:50.520]   to bring you $30 of revenue into your business as a customer. So therefore, you should look
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:56.940]   at that and you should calculate how much you can afford to spend for the acquisition
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:07.180]   of that customer. Now, trick question here. Should you look at that category and say,
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:13.580]   "Okay, I've got $30. If I take that $30 over here and invest it in some place other than
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:19.700]   my business, I could achieve, let's say, an X percent rate of return. So I'm going to
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:25.140]   get 30 plus X. So in order to calculate the cost of my spending the $30, I should take
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.940]   the $30 minus X and that's how much I should spend on acquiring that customer." Something
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:38.260]   like let's say I should spend $25 to acquire the customer. Is that the proper analysis
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:46.060]   or do you need more information? The answer is you need more information because you don't
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:53.020]   look at the initial sale. You look at the average lifetime value of a customer. The
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.820]   most important calculation for you as a business owner is to calculate... That was too strong
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:05.780]   of a statement. An important number for you to know as a business owner is the total lifetime
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:12.820]   value of a customer. Let's say that you calculate that the average initial transaction with
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.820]   the customer is $30. But yet that average customer will return to your business a total
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:26.260]   of 10 times over the course of their time with you. So therefore, the total value, the
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:35.540]   lifetime value of the customer is $300. Would it be crazy for you to spend $50 in order
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:44.260]   to acquire a customer on an initial basis whose total lifetime value to you is $300?
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:50.940]   Wouldn't be crazy at all. Now you need good data to be confident of that number because
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.140]   if you're going to spend $50 to get a $30 customer transaction, that's going to lead
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.700]   to some losses in the initial stage until those later sales come in. But if you have
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:07.500]   that data and you know the number, you could spend $100 to acquire a $300 customer. That's
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.980]   what business does. Business prints money. It prints money because if you can find a
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:21.460]   way to spend $100 and get $300, you've now printed $200 of profit or of at least additional
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.340]   revenue subject to the margins in your business to calculate your profit.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.220]   I hope you get the point. The point is that when you look at different budget categories,
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.420]   you need to isolate an expenditure and figure out if it's something that you should want
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:44.580]   to do more of, meaning I want to have a high expenditure in this area. If I have a proven
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:50.620]   marketing plan, I want to put as much money into that proven marketing plan as possible.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.700]   Every dollar that I have, I'll allocate into that marketing plan because I know I'm printing
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:04.580]   money or is this a category where I want to be careful and cautious recognizing the value
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.060]   and return trade-off of this category. Vacation, we want to take a nice vacation. I want to
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.660]   make this certain memory with my family. This is important to me. I'm willing to spend this
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.420]   amount of money. I'm not trying to do it super cheap, but I'm also just making an
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:24.780]   intentional decision. Or is this a category where I just want to cut as ruthlessly as
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:31.100]   possible? This is my internet bill. I need 20 megabits per second at download speed and
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.500]   whoever gives it to me, I'll take it. It doesn't matter whether it's the cable company or the
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.460]   phone company or the internet company that's beaming it down from the satellite or from
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:48.140]   the hot air balloon tethered above my town. I just need the internet access. It's a commodity.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:56.180]   You've got to pay careful attention to those categories and good budgeting will give you
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.460]   the indications.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:04.980]   Now with regard to business budgeting, I'm going to end my comments there. I hope that
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:10.500]   you can see if you're a business person. Most likely, many of you are not doing your own
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.220]   bookkeeping. Some of you are, but I at least encourage you to isolate the categories in
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:22.660]   your business and try to look at them very carefully and to understand what type of expense
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.020]   this is. Is this something I want to do more of as much as possible? Because even if you
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.140]   want to do as much as possible, that doesn't mean that you can spend an unlimited amount
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:37.460]   of money in an area. Best example to stay with is advertising. There's a point of diminishing
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:43.380]   returns. There are markets that you can buy advertising in and then at times you saturate
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.180]   those markets. So even though you may have mountains of cash sitting there, you can't
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   find the inventory, the ad inventory, the number of billboards are not available. You
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.260]   can't buy the commercials. You can't buy the targeted clicks. You can't spend enough money
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.020]   in that category.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.220]   So just because you want to spend as much money as possible on something like marketing
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.700]   and promotion, doesn't mean that you'll always be able to spend as much money. So take your
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:14.660]   business books and whether you do this officially or whether you just do this mentally, separate
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:21.500]   each category into should I spend more or less so that when you're looking at the books,
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:28.620]   you can get clear on them. There's a major fallacy to think that, "Well, I can just spend
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.900]   freely in business expenses." No, there are business expenses you still want to minimize
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.500]   because the point of business is to make a profit. So you want to be ruthless with those
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.300]   business expenses that aren't bringing you revenue.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.100]   There are some business expenses that are that middle zone. You might not technically
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:52.820]   need to hire this particular job function done. But at your stage in entrepreneurship,
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.520]   it's not something that you enjoy doing and it would be significant quality of life. Hey,
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.060]   if you're going to pay – it's going to get you a 50 percent tax deduction based upon
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.260]   your business tax rate, your personal tax rate, et cetera, go ahead and hire it done.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:12.260]   It's not a must do it but I'm also not cutting things to the bone. You negotiate leases,
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.400]   hardcore. Get those as low as possible. You bring in employees from time to time to make
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.500]   your life easier and to free up more time and to make your business run more smoothly.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:27.660]   But you don't go all in on those expenditures and expenditures that make you revenue, you
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.340]   go all in.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.540]   But that's where I'm leaving my comments on business and I'm going to share with you
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.300]   now my personal categories because – for my personal budget because those will be more
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.100]   applicable to a broader range of you. So for the rest of this conversation, we're going
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.900]   to say that I've earned a dollar of income and that shows up as personal income. It's
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:52.300]   been transferred over to my personal budget. For you, that means the money may be coming
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.260]   in as a paycheck or it might come in as profits from your business. I don't care here about
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:02.220]   the characterization. I don't care whether this is a dollar of investment income or wages
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.540]   or dividends. I just care that it's a dollar of income in the personal budget. Now, we're
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.140]   going to budget it.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.780]   And we're going to talk first about what do you do. Do you pay yourself first? Before
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:19.540]   I continue that, I want to do here just a fairly obvious ad for YNAB. Again, I use the
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.300]   YNAB software. I use YNAB for that business budget. I use YNAB for that personal budget.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.420]   Go back, please, and listen to episode 246 of the show, which again is called You Need
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.020]   a Budget and Here's the Best Way for You to Make One. But I reached out to YNAB. YNAB
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.940]   was the number one most recommended product when I talked about bringing sponsors on to
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:42.060]   Radical Personal Finance. So many of you said, "Get YNAB. We love YNAB."
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:48.020]   Now, for the previous probably eight to nine years, I've done all my budgeting with an
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.500]   Excel spreadsheet. I'm very good with Excel. I'm very good with spreadsheets because I've
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.260]   always had an irregular income. And the problem that I had, which was difficult to solve,
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.720]   was that I never knew how much money I would have at any particular month. So I could never
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.580]   do that simple budget that many people imagine where they sit down and they say, "Okay, I
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.420]   got a check that's $2,000 twice a month. So on the first of the month, I'm going to take
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.700]   my $2,000. I'm going to put it on a sheet of paper and I'm going to spend it down the
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.580]   page until it's zero." That's great. I never figured out how to do that because I didn't
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.700]   know if I was going to have a $2,000 check on the first of the month, a $0 check on the
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.020]   15th of the month, and an $8,000 check on the first of the month, the following, followed
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.180]   by two months of no income. How do you do it? It's really tough.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.660]   Well, when I finally found YNAB again and tried it, I was blown away at how good it
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:41.180]   was. And the reason it's so good is that YNAB allows you, nay encourages you, nay forces
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:48.260]   you, to budget every dollar that you have in your checking accounts. And you can't spend
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.980]   the money unless you've budgeted it. But if you need to adjust the budget, you can adjust
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:58.460]   it at any time. And it is so good, so good especially for irregular incomes because you
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.460]   can look and you can budget different categories and you can make adjustments, et cetera.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.340]   Now, it's hard for me to do much more than that, to explain that much more in just a
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.660]   short little ad here, but it's really, really good. Now, sign up, get a free 34-day trial

[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:17.260]   Question, should you pay yourself first? This is a concept that's often thrown around. And
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:24.340]   the idea here is the first thing you should do is save money. And this is a valid concept.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:30.420]   Very few people ever actually save money because they have too many expenses that come before
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:36.340]   they're able to save. They got too much month and not enough money. And I have observed
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:42.700]   it to be true that generally the only people who save money are those who proactively,
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:48.420]   consciously choose to save money and save money right off the top, right up front. So
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.460]   the way it works, if you were paying yourself first would be you'd earn a dollar and you'd
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:57.460]   decide how much am I going to save? Let's say you were going to save 10 cents of that
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:02.580]   dollar, 10%. So you'd set aside those 10 cents and then you'd figure out how to live on the
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:10.660]   remaining 90%. That's the idea of pay yourself first. Now, should you do that? Well, obviously
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.940]   I don't have a problem with that practice, but I don't actually personally think that
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:26.100]   you should pay yourself first. I like to practice the principle or habit of pay yourself second
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.220]   and give money away first. And so for me, the first category is going to be giving.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.740]   Now there are a few different aspects of giving. I'm not here today to tell you how much of
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:40.860]   your money you need or should give away. That's up to you. You've got to decide that. That
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:46.440]   number may change throughout your lifetime, but it should be a part of your budget. Giving
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:56.260]   money away in a way that gives you very little benefit, if any, is a very, very healthy practice.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:01.580]   And if you don't give away 10 cents out of a dollar, I find it very hard to believe you'll
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:10.140]   give away a million out of $10 million. Giving is a practice, giving is a habit. I find it
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:16.300]   quite astonishing and humorous when people often say, "Well, if I had X number of dollars,
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:27.660]   then I would give away such and such." But yet sometimes these same people never give
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:34.580]   away their money, never give away their time, never give away their skills, never give away
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.620]   anything. And I've observed that more money just makes you more of who you are. So I think
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:46.900]   a really healthy practice from the very beginning of your financial life, or if it's too late
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:53.720]   for that today, for you to start and practice, is to always give money away. Very important.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:00.700]   Now I think of giving in three different categories. There's the giving of gifts, gifts such as
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:06.940]   birthday gifts to your children or to family members or to friends, Christmas gifts, just
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:13.660]   special gifts that you want to give to somebody. Things such as, "Hey, we know that so and
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.180]   so, this family is going through a hard time, so let's give them a gift certificate so they
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.140]   can enjoy a nice dinner out." Or, "Let's pick up the tab for a younger couple who would
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:27.300]   really appreciate that when taking them out on a nice dinner out again, or send them away
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.220]   on a nice family vacation or whatever." These are gifts. So I think of gifts as being very
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:36.860]   important. We've just come through Christmas. Christmas is obviously for most people, probably
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:42.980]   the biggest budget category of gifts all year, and you've got a budget for this money that
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:49.900]   you're going to spend on gifts. So I like to keep a category under my giving marked
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:56.180]   gifts. That way we have a budget available, birthday parties, et cetera. I've got, let's
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:02.940]   see, 12, 13, 12, 10. I guess I've got 10 nieces and nephews on my side of the family. So birthdays
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:08.020]   come around pretty regularly. Every few weeks it seems there's another birthday party. So
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.260]   these things require gifts.
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.100]   The next category of giving is what I think of as systematic contributions and support.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.860]   For many people, this will involve a tithe that you pay to your church, or this will
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:28.980]   involve systematic support that you give to a family member who's depending on your income,
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:34.900]   or this may involve organizations, charities, ministry organizations that you choose to
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:40.100]   systematically support on an ongoing basis. So I think of that as systematic contributions
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.140]   and support.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:49.020]   And then category number three, I just call ad hoc financial contributions to others.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:55.260]   The idea here is I want to have an account ready that's available so that when I see
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:02.540]   an opportunity to give money to somebody in need, I have it budgeted. I've learned that
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.560]   this particular practice can be one of the most freeing things you can do. That way when
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:11.300]   you get the GoFundMe page that was just shared on Facebook for somebody in need, et cetera,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.500]   you don't have to wonder, "Oh, can I afford it?" You just go to your budget and you look
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.040]   in your ad hoc financial contributions number and see how much money's there, and then go
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.740]   ahead and make your donation based upon how much is there and how much you feel you'd
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.400]   like to give.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:30.380]   I think these are three useful categorizations to make under giving money. And here would
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.760]   be some of the value of having these broken out as categories, especially in the context
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:40.420]   of your year-end financial review and planning for the next year. If you look at the amount
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:46.080]   of money that you spend on gifts for family, birthday gifts, Christmas gifts, et cetera,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.740]   you might look at that and ask yourself, "Am I getting a lot of value from this? Is the
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:55.500]   person I'm giving to giving a lot of value for this?" This would be the type of category
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:01.500]   that I would look at carefully because there's no stated percentage that's the right number
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:12.280]   to give. Should you give away 3% of your income as your birthday gift budget or your Christmas
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:18.300]   gift budget? This is one of those things where you want to look at it and analyze the value
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.220]   that you're getting or the value that the person is getting based upon the dollars you're
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:27.900]   spending. And you might look at it and you might find, "You know what? We're spending
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:33.300]   all kinds of money on plastic toys for children who don't need plastic toys. Maybe we could
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:39.320]   take that same money and we could spend it in a way that is more useful to the child.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.360]   Maybe instead of spending the money on plastic toys, we could spend the money to open an
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.900]   investment account and buy the person a share of stock each year for their birthday in a
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:53.020]   company that we think that they'll like. Or maybe we can take it and instead of buying
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:59.180]   a plastic toy, maybe we can buy a one-ounce silver coin and perhaps each year of their
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.300]   life we'll give them a one-ounce silver American Eagle if they're from the United States. We'll
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:09.260]   give them a one-ounce silver American Eagle from the beginning of that particular year."
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.580]   So then a simple plan like that could be that you sit down and you count the number of nieces
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:18.420]   and nephews that you have and each year you just buy a box of silver coins from the U.S.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   Mint. You go ahead and get them and now you've got your birthday present squared away and
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.580]   you've enhanced your personal silver coin collection at the same time, which who knows
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:33.660]   could wind up being useful to you as an investment practice. Let's say you spend 500 bucks on
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.080]   a box of silver coins at the beginning of the year and it's your way of having gifts
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:42.940]   ready to go and it's a way of making sure that you also have some additional silver
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:47.220]   lying around. You'll wind up with extra coins at the end of the year. For some of
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.500]   you that's a useful conversation piece. It's a way to teach people and it could be
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:57.740]   a cool collection. How cool would it be if you arrived at the age of 21 and you looked
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.860]   back and you had a silver American Eagle for each year of your life? Maybe at some point
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.540]   in time you can transfer that to gold if you're wealthier. It's fun to have collections of
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:12.220]   things like coins. Or maybe you look at that gift that you're giving and you say, "Well,
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.300]   I've got my favorite nephew Joey and I was going to give him this plastic toy. But you
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.220]   know what I'm going to do instead? I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to schedule a day
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:25.100]   and Joey and I are going to go fishing and I'm going to pay for the fishing trip instead
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:32.340]   of the plastic toy." It doesn't matter. You've got to figure out. There's an age at which
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.980]   a child wants a plastic toy and there's an age at which a fishing trip would be valuable.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.620]   But you can look at that and by having it distinguished in your budget as gifts, it
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:48.100]   gives you the opportunity to plan to get the maximum value from it. Perhaps you're a grandparent
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:54.900]   and each year you're spending thousands of dollars on Christmas gifts. But yet you notice
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:01.340]   how in our modern culture the toys are abundant and the novelty wears off. Is there a way
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:09.060]   that you can take those thousands of dollars and translate that into something different?
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:16.340]   Perhaps renting a Christmas cabin in the mountains of North Carolina and financing all of those
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:23.220]   things including a day at the local ski resort. Perhaps that would be a way of building a
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:30.220]   really nice family tradition. By having it broken out, you can look at this category
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:37.020]   for what it is and for what it should be, which is a maximization of value. You're not
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:43.980]   necessarily trying to see how little you can give, but you're not necessarily trying to
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:49.420]   see how much you can give. This is one of those maximization of value categories.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.700]   Now at some stages of life, you might look at this category and just recognize that,
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.860]   "Man, this is blowing our budget. We can't do this." I've counseled with young couples,
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:04.220]   young families, and this can be extremely challenging for parents of young children
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:10.020]   because you may, depending on the size of your child's social circle, you might wind
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.940]   up at a different birthday party every few weeks. If in your cohort of parents, it's
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:19.180]   expected for you to give birthday presents that are on the $30 level. If you wind up
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:25.260]   at a birthday party, say 30 weeks out of the year, which would not be unreasonable if your
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:31.860]   child has 20 friends in their class, times $30 each, that's $600 a year. For a young
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.140]   family, that could be a substantial amount of money.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.620]   So for you at that stage of life, this may be a category at which you home in and say,
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.700]   "You know what? We're just going to change. We're going to give a craft, or we're going
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.540]   to give a favorite book, or we're going to figure out a way to reduce this." Or we may
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:57.300]   not give a present at all. Totally reasonable option. So that's the category of gifts.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.820]   What about systematic contributions and support? This is a category that you'll have to
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:07.340]   judge yourself. For example, those of you who are engaged in the practice of tithing
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.720]   to your church. Tithing is generally practiced as 10% of your income is given to your local
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.740]   church right off the top. Well, if you practice that, that's very simple for you to take your
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:26.620]   income and calculate and say 10% goes right there into the local church. So that's not
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.940]   a category that you try to increase or decrease. That's not something you're trying to save
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.740]   money. You're making a voluntary choice to send 10% of your income to your local church
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:42.620]   as a tithe. Or perhaps you look at this and include in this organizations that you support.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:47.700]   Well, you should know this as expressed as a percentage of your budget. Perhaps you're
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:53.900]   supporting a political organization that's seeking to advance a cause that you feel passionately
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.620]   about. Or perhaps this is an organization that is involved in doing some kind of work
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:05.580]   elsewhere in the world that you feel is important. Certainly this is a category where you want
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:12.740]   to analyze it and decide if the company or the organization or the church or whomever
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:20.220]   is doing a good job with it. But again, it's not necessarily a minimization thing. You're
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:25.460]   seeking to have it funded. Now, if you don't give all of that to one organization, then
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.180]   you may want to choose and say, "Well, I need to make sure that I have this budget." And
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:33.860]   so each year you're picking and choosing the organizations. I think a really healthy practice
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:40.060]   is if you're going to give money to an organization, a political organization, charitable organization,
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:47.260]   you should expect results from that organization. And you should plan to give for a short period
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:52.580]   of time expecting results. Now, this doesn't really work if you're giving $50 a year to
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.860]   the local chapter of blah, blah, blah. But if you're giving substantially, let's say
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:04.580]   that you are a major donor, you should give with the intention of getting results. And
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.420]   there should always be a question in that organization's mind if they're going to get
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.860]   your money. And you should make it clear, "You're only getting my money if you're getting
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.500]   results." So have this as a category.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.740]   Moving more quickly, ad hoc financial contributions to others. Please, I just ask you to put this
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:25.220]   in practice. Set aside an amount of money in your budget that's always available to
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:35.300]   give to others. This, perhaps more than anything I've yet said, has the potential to revolutionize
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:43.480]   your finances. Because when you always have money available to give, you start to see
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   opportunities to give. If you're strapped, you'll often just bumble past those opportunities
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:59.860]   and not recognize them for what they are. But if you have a pile of money burning a
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:06.680]   metaphorical hole in your pocket, you start to look at people in need a little bit different.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.500]   So I beg of you, if you were going to take anything from this, set aside a giving account
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:18.140]   in your budget and make sure that it's funded at an appropriate level for you. And make
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:25.860]   sure that it's not all spoken for in advance. Don't just track the money that you give.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:30.300]   Proactively budget the money and do it in a way that will allow it to accumulate little
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:37.820]   by little so you can experience the joy of being a giver. Talk to wealthy people. You
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:47.860]   go do your own research and find out the impact that giving has made in their life. I think
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   you'll find it substantial. Now let's move on to saving and investing.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.980]   Before we do, sponsor of the day number two today is Libsyn. Libsyn is short for Liberated
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:04.300]   Syndication. Libsyn is the podcast host that I use to host my podcast. Libsyn is a fantastic
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:12.160]   company. If you are a media creator, especially a podcast creator, or if you are interested
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:18.700]   in becoming one, I would strongly encourage you to consider using Libsyn. Here's why.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.480]   There are free ways out there which if you are technologically competent, you can come
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:30.260]   up with to host your podcast. And so I wouldn't say that Libsyn is the cheapest way to do
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.380]   it. I could figure out how to do stuff and what I'm doing for free. I'm technically competent
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:44.620]   enough to do that now. But if you're measuring value, cost versus benefits, services, there's
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:48.940]   no better value proposition out there than Libsyn. Libsyn is one of the oldest podcast
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:54.340]   media hosts and they are one of the most advanced. They're one of the most robust, which is a
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:46:00.260]   big, big deal. And they just do a fantastic job. I had nothing but good experiences with
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:07.020]   Libsyn. My hope is that many of you in 2017 will start and launch a podcast. I think that
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:14.700]   podcasting is one of the most powerful electronic media communications of media possible. Now,
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.820]   not necessarily as a commercial endeavor like I'm doing it. Partly, many of you, it should
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.620]   be as a marketing component to your overall marketing for your business or for your personal
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:27.980]   brand. But it may even be something as a way of organizing, something that you're doing.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:33.940]   Perhaps you're involved with a local competition or club in some particular area. Well, why
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:41.980]   not go ahead and use the format and the simple format of podcasting as a way to do that.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:46.900]   Libsyn will teach you step by step how to do it, how to set it up, how to use the simplest
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:52.340]   tools and how to get a podcast launched, a very robust podcast. And it can be just as
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:57.260]   inexpensive as a few dollars a month. If you're thinking about it or you are interested in
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:02.380]   that, check it out. Check out their website, libsyn.com. If you'd like to sign up, here's
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.700]   a little trick. Make sure you use my promo code, Radical, and they will give you your
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:13.700]   first month of media hosting on Libsyn for free if you do that. Now, a little radical
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:19.900]   tip for you. You can actually possibly get as much as about 57 or 58 days for free. Here's
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:25.480]   what you do. When you sign up for Libsyn, sign up for their largest hosting package
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.060]   that they give because they give you whatever it is. The first month that they give you,
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.700]   they give you that month for free using the coupon code Radical. Sign up for the largest
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.140]   one. If you sign up for a small one and then you increase, they'll bill you when you do
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:43.020]   the increase. But Libsyn does all of their billing on the first of each month. So word
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:49.460]   to the wise, sign up. Don't sign up on December 31st. Sign up on something like January 3,
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:55.120]   January 2, January 3. Use the coupon code Radical. Sign up for the biggest package.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.640]   Go ahead and start uploading your shows. Then, if you signed up on January 3, your first
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.680]   month free will start on February 1 and you'll get all of February for free. The next billing
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.820]   won't be until March 1. So sometime, if you were to sign up on January 3, sometime before
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:16.020]   March 1, go ahead and jump in there and then lower the package to whatever the amount that
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.180]   is that you need. You'll get that first month which comes out based upon how they do their
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:26.580]   billing could be as much as about 58 days for free. Libsyn.com, L-I-B-S-Y-N, Liberated
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.720]   Syndication, Libsyn.com, the best podcast host, the one that I use. It's what accounts
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.620]   for the fact that Radical Personal Finance since my first year has been rock solid. Get
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.280]   a free month free with the coupon code Radical.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:43.860]   Now let's talk about savings and investments. I'm going to move quickly through the rest
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:49.300]   of these categories and also through this one. Just simply to say this, I think you
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:59.980]   should allocate your savings and your investments in some way that you've intentionally chosen.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.380]   This is a little bit difficult to manage in budgeting software because some of you, your
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:09.500]   savings and investments will be done before the money shows up in your checking account.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:15.220]   That's great. For example, your 401(k) contributions may be deducted or your health savings account
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:20.580]   contributions may be automatically contributed. Or perhaps you're investing in your business
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:26.700]   heavily, and so your business is growing and you know that's a good investment, but you
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.140]   can't really see that in your personal savings.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:35.320]   Don't fall into the trap of trying to say that budgeting software and your ability to
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:41.740]   use it should be reflective of all of the information. Many of you have an interest
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.100]   in knowing what percentage of your income are you saving. That's really good. And you
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:49.740]   may have a goal such as I want to save half of my income. Really good goal. But you may
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.740]   not be able to get your budgeting software to display that information. Remember, budgeting
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.080]   software is not an income statement. So if you want to calculate what savings rate you
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.180]   have, build an income statement. Do that separately. That's something that doesn't need to be
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.740]   automated. Just use your budgeting categories to fill that in.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:11.300]   I do think savings and investments should be allocated between different approaches.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:18.260]   Here are some ideas. You could allocate this based upon short-term savings and longer-term
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:24.700]   savings. That's a big deal. Shorter-term savings, longer-term savings. You could allocate this
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:33.500]   based upon savings for spending versus savings for wealth or savings for investments. If
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:38.820]   you're saving for a new item, just did the show on RVs, when I was saving for an RV,
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:43.740]   that's not an investment. I wouldn't characterize that as an investment. That's a consumption
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:49.400]   item. But it's something I'm saving for. And so you want to indicate that. That's different
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.260]   than saving for wealth. That's different than a 401(k) contribution or money that I'm saving
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.540]   for real estate down payments on rental houses or money that I'm saving to start a business.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:07.100]   So give your savings a name and understand the nature of the savings. Understand what
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:13.380]   it's earmarked for. A major focus with savings should be that there should be a goal associated
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:18.200]   with it. One more categorization for you to consider would be, should I save for passive
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:24.860]   investing or should I save for active investing? Here I'm not referring to passive investing
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:29.740]   in the sense of index funds. I'm referring to this in the sense of saving and investing
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:36.040]   in a way where someone else is managing it and you're not. Probably a good idea, too,
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.420]   if you have an abundance of income, to always have some amount of money that's going into
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:45.180]   savings that's being managed by someone else. Mutual fund manager is managing it or an investment
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:50.260]   broker or somebody is managing the money. That's passive. That's different than active,
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:56.540]   such as starting a business. I think both are important. So with children, I'd like
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:01.340]   to see them save half of their money for passive investing and half of their money for active
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:06.060]   investing. So half of it goes into mutual funds. Half of it is always available as,
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.060]   "Hey, this is your business seed money. Look around. What opportunities do you see
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.820]   in the marketplace?" Now, is there any science behind this? No, of course not. These are
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:20.440]   just numbers. But the idea is there's concepts and concepts are powerful. So give your savings
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.700]   a name. Don't try to make it all show up in the budget category. If you're maxing your
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:32.060]   401(k) and that's the biggest thing that's the most important to you, fine. But you should
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:38.540]   put in savings a name. This is one of my favorite things also about YNAB, the budgeting software,
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:43.100]   that you can add or take away categories at any time. So you can give little savings goals
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:49.600]   categories. If you wind up putting too much money in them, it's easy to clean them out.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.860]   You might have a category for RV and you might have a category for a new horse and you might
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.660]   have a category for annual vacation. Well, when you get to annual vacation time and you're
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.140]   sitting down and you're calculating, you might say, "Well, let's spend a little bit less
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:08.660]   money on the annual vacation. Let's throw that towards the RV." Or, "Let's go ahead.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:13.180]   RV is not so important. Let's take the annual vacation." So the net takeaway I want you
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:18.260]   to have for savings and investing is give your saving and investing goals names, names
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:22.300]   that are powerful to you, names that are going to draw you toward it, not, "Oh, I'm saving
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:28.020]   money." If you're saving for financial independence, write on there, "Financial independence,"
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:33.300]   and make it powerful. Make your goals strong so they call to you, so they pull you through
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.940]   the difficult times.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:41.940]   So those are the first two categories on my budget. And I like to keep them at the top
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:48.540]   because I'm paying others first and paying myself second. There's no smooth way to say,
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.660]   "Pay yourself first, give first." I guess I could say that. "Give first, pay yourself
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:57.260]   second." I like to have those at the top, all those categories at the top of my budget.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:02.260]   That way I never forget. We don't want to forget.
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:07.700]   Now what else? The next category that I have is a category for monthly bills. Again, personal
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:14.780]   budget, monthly bills. And monthly bills are payments that I've agreed to that are going
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:22.460]   to be the same every month. Rent, electricity, things like that. Bills over which I have
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:28.140]   no direct control on a monthly basis. Bills that I know just about how much they're going
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.380]   to be. I can't change my rent on a month-to-month basis.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.940]   And I personally, for my personal budget, I like to have a subcategory for each and
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:43.180]   every bill. So internet is different than phone, et cetera. So the benefit of this is
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:48.780]   now putting my hat on, I look at these bills and I think, "Is there any benefit to me
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:53.340]   of this bill? And can I get this as low as possible?"
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:58.540]   Not all categories do you want to be as low as possible. I could probably spend less money
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:03.220]   on rent than I'm spending now, but I don't want to live in the apartment that I could
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:07.580]   rent for less money than I'm renting now. I could spend more money on rent than I'm
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:12.180]   renting now. And at some point I might want to live in that apartment for more than what
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.740]   I'm spending now.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:21.940]   That's different than internet. Now, my internet bill is primarily associated with my business,
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:27.220]   but perhaps for you it's not. Perhaps your cable bill. There's no problem to you looking
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.500]   at the cable bill and saying, "Eh, I'll just go with whoever's cheapest." And you want
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:35.340]   to have this set out so that from time to time you can do price shopping. Probably at
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:40.300]   least once a year you should tackle each of these budget categories and seek to minimize
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.540]   the expense.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.820]   But they're monthly bills. So at the beginning of the budgeting month when the money comes
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:51.060]   in we're just going to make sure they're funded in time for the draft. If you're using an
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:55.320]   automatic draft or in time to send out the check. Now, that's different. I keep a separate
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:00.380]   category called everyday expenses. Everyday expenses are things over which I have direct
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:08.380]   control. Good example, food. Under food I maintain two categories. One, groceries, and
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:13.780]   one, restaurants. For you, you might have different categories. Some of you should have
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:18.540]   a category on there for coffee. Some of you should have a category for alcohol. And you
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.620]   should break it out because if you're looking down and you're recognizing, "Hey, I spent
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:26.780]   $500 on restaurants," but you realize you only had about two meals, you probably spent
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:31.340]   it on alcohol. So you should have a budget on there for alcohol so that you have things
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.380]   on there.
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:37.500]   But everyday expenses are budget categories that are quickly changeable. So we want to
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:44.100]   keep a sharp eye on them and we want to adjust them on an ongoing basis. So simple ones,
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:49.180]   we all do food, groceries, and restaurants. Restaurant bill doesn't want to be zero, but
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:55.740]   you also need to know how much it is compared to how much you're spending on groceries.
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:00.420]   Next one is fuel, car fuel. Again, you can change that. Clothing, a couple of unique
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:06.820]   ones that I carry. I have a budget category called dog expenses. I have two dogs. I find
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:13.340]   them to be expensive. So I crack all of their expenses as dog expenses. And you may want
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.780]   to do something similar.
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:19.300]   Now that does require a certain amount of discipline. You may go to Costco and you might
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:27.180]   find yourself buying groceries, tools for your shop, alcohol, and dog food. So when
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:31.820]   you come home, be diligent about breaking that $600 bill out and putting it into its
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:38.460]   proper categories. I have a category here called kid expenses. Now this is primarily
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:45.060]   my personal experimentation as a personal finance guy. I don't buy for an instant that
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:51.060]   kids are all that expensive. All of the nonsense about it costs a hundred or however many hundreds
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:57.300]   of thousands of dollars to raise a child is just absolute baloney. Kids are not that expensive.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.620]   They really don't. You'll spend as much or as little on children as you choose to spend
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:05.140]   or as much or as little as you have. But I do like to track that so I know. And that
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.700]   way it gives me insight into the types of things that are related to kids. So I track
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:13.740]   their clothing. I track any expenses that are associated with them, any medical expenses
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:17.940]   or any entertainment expenses, things like that. If it's something that I wouldn't
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:22.860]   do or wouldn't involve myself with if I didn't have children, then I go ahead and
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:28.220]   put it under child expenses. That just is for me for more fun than anything else, partly
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:33.300]   as to see whether I'm right or wrong about my opinion on the cost of children. Obviously
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:40.780]   that category is not all inclusive. Obviously that doesn't include something like groceries.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:44.860]   I'm not breaking my groceries out based upon how much each of my kids eat, but it's
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.340]   valuable for me to know. One important everyday expense item that I have is something called
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:54.220]   reimbursable expenses. And that's anything I spend that I'm expecting to be reimbursed
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:58.140]   for. I believe you should have probably an extra budget category for this because it's
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.820]   easy to lose track of the reimbursements that you're entitled to. If you're buying
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:05.940]   something for somebody, have it as your category. You might find yourself in a situation where
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:09.660]   you're spending all kinds of extra money and you're not really budgeting for that,
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.060]   but you know it's going to come in in a couple of days. I've done this many times,
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:16.220]   so I just maintain a category, reimbursable expenses, with the goal of zeroing out as
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:22.020]   quickly as possible. A couple of other major categories, one would be asset expenditures.
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:29.180]   I find it useful to differentiate between consumption expenses associated with an asset
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:35.680]   versus asset expenditures. Best example I can think of would be a car. I keep a fuel
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:44.500]   budget and a car insurance budget separate from the vehicle category. The reason is I'm
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.700]   never going to get the money back that I'm spending on fuel. So fuel is one of those
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.820]   things that I want to look and evaluate. I'm not going to get the money back that I'm
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:56.940]   spending on car insurance. So car insurance is one of those categories that I want to
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:03.140]   just shop around from for time to time. But if I'm buying a vehicle, I might be buying
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:08.220]   that vehicle because I have a need and it's not exactly something that's the cheapest
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:12.780]   thing now, but it might still be a good idea. An example, a few months ago I bought another
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:16.420]   minivan. I don't think I've said it on the show before. I bought another minivan a few
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:20.980]   months ago. Why did I buy another minivan? Well, I didn't need one. I already had a perfectly
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:28.220]   serviceable minivan, but I came across a good deal on the type of minivan that I would like
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:33.180]   to have in my family. I know that it's very valuable to have a backup minivan. I know
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:39.020]   that the value of the vehicle as compared to the cost of the vehicle was very, very
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.700]   high. So I now have two minivans. My first minivan was a Hyundai Entourage that I bought
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.780]   a number of years ago. I paid an inexpensive price for it, but that vehicle has a lot of
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:52.340]   miles on it. It's over 200,000 miles and it's had various mechanical problems and I expect
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.860]   it to have mechanical problems in the future. One of the challenges with buying used cars,
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:04.120]   especially cheap used cars, is the inventory of used cars is often very thin. And if you're
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:11.780]   buying a car when you need one, it can be hard to get the selection that you need. If
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:16.820]   you've got to buy a car today, you're probably not going to be able to get a great deal on
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:22.700]   the perfect car for you, at least not in the used market. That's what new cars, new car
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.100]   dealerships and what used car dealerships specialize in. If you're going to need to
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.580]   go and buy a great car today, you can trot right out to the dealership and they have
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:34.740]   the selection, but you're going to pay more. It's hard to figure out which country road
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.880]   do I drive down in order to see the ideal car that's reliable and that's inexpensive
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.140]   and parked on the side of the road. You can't predict that. So what I have learned with
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:48.020]   some expenses such as cars, when I come across them, I need to buy them. So previously we
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.980]   had two cars. I had this little old Toyota Corolla that I bought, same type of thing.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:55.420]   It was for sale. I didn't particularly have to have it, but I recognized the value of
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.780]   it, went ahead and bought it, paid 500 bucks for it. But now with a third child on the
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:04.580]   way, that doesn't work as my backup car. And having children, it's important to me to have
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:08.780]   a backup car at this point in time. There have been times where my van was in the
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:15.700]   shop and as a single person or as a couple, it's easy to have Uber as a backup. Moving
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:20.840]   around with three car seats is a little harder to use Uber as a backup. I have a good family
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.000]   network for backup cars, but I like to have a backup car. So I came across an opportunity
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.780]   to buy a Toyota Sienna, 10 years old. I got a great deal on it. It's one of the most reliable,
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:38.620]   consistent cars, 150,000 miles. That is my perfect car. A minivan that's 10 years old,
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:44.180]   very reliable make and model, well cared for, few scratches and dents and dings, perfect.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:51.780]   That's what I want. And so I bought it. Didn't have to have it, didn't need it, but I bought
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   it because I saw the value over the coming years. And the cost of owning a car like that
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:03:01.140]   is minimal from a depreciation perspective. So what's the point of this? Point is that
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.900]   I didn't plan to spend the money that I bought it for. I bought it for $3,000. I didn't plan
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:15.140]   to spend the $3,000 in that month. So if I'm just looking at vehicle expenditures and I'm
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:21.860]   analyzing vehicle costs, I'll see a huge $3,000 bump. And if I'm just pulling my hair out
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:27.780]   about, "Oh, I spent this $3,000 and I didn't need to do that." That's different than me
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:35.100]   looking and saying, "This was an asset purchase. This was me buying an asset." Now that vehicle
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.860]   today I could go out and I could sell it in a week or two in the private market for more
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:49.180]   than $3,000. Maybe not a ton more, but I could go and sell it for more. So I want the value
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.660]   of this to be recognized. This was a balance sheet item. This wasn't a consumption item.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:56.060]   It's not an income statement item. It's a balance sheet item. So how do I do that? Well,
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:01.320]   I just keep it simple. I just have on there one for asset expenditure, vehicle expenditure.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.900]   Now I'm also going to include on that, I'm going to include there the cost of the vehicle
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:10.420]   purchase. And depending on the level of complexity, I might have vehicle repairs and maintenance.
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.740]   Because I want to know, same thing, when I buy a car, I want to go ahead and see if there's
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.600]   anything that needs to be done. Let me go ahead and fix it. I might spend another few
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.420]   hundred dollars getting everything just perfect. So that way I know it's reliable. I know everything's
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.260]   fixed. If it needs new tires, if it needs oil changes, if it needs brakes, get all that
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:30.060]   stuff done so the vehicle is ready to go. Well, those are asset expenditures. And so
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.580]   I'm of course being careful with them, but I'm not trying to get it as cheap as possible.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.660]   If I were just trying to get it as cheap as possible, I wouldn't have bought the car.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:42.220]   But then I might wind up in a situation next year where my other car breaks down and now
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.360]   I don't have a car and I don't have my backup car and I don't have the second car and now
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:53.560]   what do I do? So I need to plan ahead. So I characterize balance sheet items separately.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.540]   Do the same thing with something like my motorhome. I did just announce, talked about the motorhome.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.540]   That was something that I purchased, but I keep it on there as an asset expenditure.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:07.980]   It's a balance sheet item. It's something that has value that I could sell. My goal
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.900]   of course when buying something like that is to get a good deal, but the good deal is
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.500]   not necessarily measured the same way that other expenses are. A good deal is not necessarily
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:23.440]   the cheapest item. Rather, a good deal is going to be the cheapest item that does the
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:29.300]   job as compared to the value of the item in the resale market. So I might search and figure
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:35.300]   out here's what I think is a good deal. Then I'll go ahead and purchase the item and I
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:40.260]   want to track any expenditures on that item that are related in the world of business
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:48.860]   would be depreciable – sorry. Yeah, expenses that are not directly associated with consumption
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.900]   but that are just associated with the repair and the maintenance and the upkeep.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:57.620]   So with my RV, I needed to fix the generator. I tried to fix it myself a couple of times.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.020]   I couldn't do it. So that's categorized under there. So now I have good records. Now
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:06.780]   I can look at that and I want to analyze how much is this motorhome costing me? How much
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.580]   is this second minivan actually costing me? How much am I spending? That's going to
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:16.500]   include all those categories. But then also when it comes time to sell, I can look at
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.620]   it and see how much money I have in it. I can try to figure out is there a way that
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:26.700]   I can sell this for what I have in it, sell this for a minor loss, sell this for a profit
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:33.300]   even. So I find this simple practice to be very helpful to keep from deluding myself.
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.020]   People often delude themselves into thinking that they're getting great deals because
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:41.760]   they don't track things. If with your vehicle, you don't have a spreadsheet that includes
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.300]   what you spent on it and what you paid for repairs, you might say, "Oh, I bought it
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.940]   for $30,000. I sold it for $25,000. I only lost $5,000 on it." But what you actually
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:54.020]   did was you bought an unreliable vehicle and you spent $5,000 repairs on it and you actually
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:58.900]   – you get the point. I don't need to belabor it. So I keep those separate.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:05.660]   Similarly, with other types of durable goods, let's say that you're purchasing – I
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:10.980]   found this when I bought a new house. You need certain types of tools and things for
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.740]   that new house in order to help you. So it's helpful to have sometimes a category that's
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:22.300]   related to something like durable goods such as a shovel, wheelbarrow, etc. These are valuable
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:28.700]   items to have when owning a house. But they're also items that can last you a lifetime when
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:33.740]   properly cared for. So you wouldn't expect to have to go out and buy another shovel next
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:40.580]   year. If you bought a house and you just had an all-inclusive Home Depot budget, it just
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:44.620]   said Home Depot. It doesn't tell you anything about your behavior. You may be choosing to
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.660]   buy those durable items that are buy-it-for-life type of things.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:53.980]   So think about your categories so that with the goal of making better decisions about
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:08:00.900]   your expenses. All spending is not bad. The goal is not always to spend the least amount
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:05.740]   of money. The goal is to get the maximum value for the money based upon your goals, based
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:08.620]   upon the type of lifestyle that you're trying to live.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:15.820]   To wrap up, let's talk about medical and taxes. I think here, there are different approaches
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:21.180]   you can take. I tend to just keep things under medical and dental. But I want to give you
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:27.820]   some possible expenses that you should consider. I do have one or two of these subcategories.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:31.180]   But for example, here are some things to consider.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:39.460]   Preventive care versus non-preventive care. You might be making a choice to invest in
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:48.900]   your health in a way that you think is proper. You might be choosing to spend money on higher
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:58.980]   quality food or better nutrition or gym memberships or any similar associated things. Is the goal
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:05.540]   to always spend the least amount of money possible? Well, probably not because if it
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:12.420]   were, you may not buy higher quality food. You may not purchase nutritional supplements.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.660]   You might just not do those things because you say, "Well, I'm trying to spend the least
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.420]   amount of money possible."
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:24.100]   But if you recognize that these types of things are investments, investments into your health,
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.940]   and if you're making wise decisions about those investments, who's to say you should
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:32.980]   try to minimize that? So it might be helpful to have a category that's called preventive
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:39.540]   care, recognizing that it's an investment. Now, that's different than saying, "Okay,
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:46.180]   I've got medical expenses that I need to track that are associated with other medical expenses
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:49.500]   or dental expenses," some more type of thing.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:53.460]   So break these out in a way that makes sense to you and that's helpful to you because,
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.860]   again, goal is not always least amount of money possible.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:01.460]   Finally, taxes. Taxes are relatively simple. You don't need to do a ton here other than,
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:06.780]   of course, if you're paying taxes, calculate them and try to keep some separate accounting
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:12.540]   for them, real estate taxes, income taxes, if you are subject to any other types of taxes
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.980]   that are easily itemized. Very, very valuable.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:20.620]   As we've talked many times on the show, the place that you live will have a major influence
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:26.140]   on your tax burden. It might sound to you, a long-time listener of Radical Personal Finance,
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:31.140]   obvious that if you choose to live in one state versus the state next door to that state,
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.980]   the difference in the tax rate may lead to your having an extra million dollars at retirement,
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.380]   but that's not obvious to most people. Why not?
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:43.600]   Why do they not recognize that if they moved from a high-income tax state to a no-income
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.460]   tax state or a low-income tax state, that would give them an extra five to say $10,000
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:53.700]   a year if they're six-figure income earners and medium families, etc.? Why do they not
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:58.720]   recognize that? Well, many times because they've never bothered to track it. They've never
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.140]   bothered to budget for it.
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:06.140]   Think about how insidious this is. The income taxes are automatically pooled right off the
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:13.180]   top. See, the government knows the power of taxation right off the top. It was a major
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:18.440]   improvement in the tax system when they switched to having the employers pay the taxes in or
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:25.940]   out of the top. It collected far more tax revenue and it changed the IRS agents from
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.900]   being a foe, "I got to pay these people money," to being a friend. Many people look at the
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.100]   government as their sugar daddy. "Oh, I get a tax refund. I can get some money. I'm really
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.940]   looking forward to my tax refund. Let me get my taxes done so I get my tax refund."
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:47.140]   Well, this is not for you. You need to know the numbers. So that way, you'll make an intentional
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:54.500]   choice. If you want to live in California because the trade-off for high income taxes
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:12:01.140]   is low property taxes and great climate, you can make that choice intentionally. And then
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:06.940]   you can feel confident about it. If you want to live in Texas because you have no income
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:13.420]   taxes, low property taxes, but you have to deal with Texas, you can make that choice.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:21.180]   If you want to live in Illinois or New York or Florida, you can decide what you're doing
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:26.660]   based upon why you're doing it. And you can adjust. If you want to live in California
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:32.180]   because you have great climate, that may require an adjustment in another area of your budget.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:41.700]   But you can make that decision intentionally. Thus, you'll feel confident with it.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.580]   So itemize the tax dollars. Figure out where they should be. And then that way, you'll
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:52.220]   be able to, I think, get far more benefit from them.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:57.260]   Those are my categories that I use. Those are the categories, subcategories, etc. Your
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:01.740]   categories may be different, but I wanted to explain how I got to those. I don't claim
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:06.340]   they're perfect. I don't claim they're an ideal model for you. For some of you, that
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:11.300]   may be so overwhelming. And the stage of budgeting you are is just to figure out, "How do I not
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.540]   be late on my power bill?" Start there.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:25.340]   Your budgeting system can, will, and should change over time. Mine certainly has. Do not
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:31.420]   expect that budgeting is always going to be the same. It's not. There are changes in the
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:35.940]   past. If you want to listen to another episode on budgeting, go back and listen to episode
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:40.820]   273 called "Three Budgets You Should Establish for 2016," time, money, and food. And in that
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:47.100]   budgeting show, I discussed the major stages of budgeting. I talked about how you'll go
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:52.860]   through different stages and purposes for budgeting. And I really think this is valuable.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:59.020]   So go back and listen to that show for that as well, because budgeting will look different.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:10.380]   You must always budget, but you must not always budget the same. You must always budget, but
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:15.900]   you must not always budget the same. One stage, you're budgeting for cash flow. Another stage,
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:19.340]   you're budgeting for big picture control. Another stage, you're just budgeting for maintenance
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.580]   to make sure you're on track.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.140]   That's it for the show today. Remember the sponsors of the day, Libsyn and YNAB. Again,
