[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Do you have a process for removing the functions
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.900]   of the day and what you were doing last week
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.900]   and what's going on in order to get more access to this?
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.620]   I'm gonna think of it now more as a receiver inside of you.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.160]   Almost like tuning a radio and then it comes in,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.740]   like the beginning of a strummer clash.
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.780]   You love the radio, Joe love the radio, right?
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.900]   And then it comes in clear and there it is.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.840]   How do you clear the static?
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.540]   What are some of the operational steps
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.060]   that you think might be more generalizable
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.380]   to regardless of where somebody in Africa
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.820]   is listening to this now?
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.940]   - When I engage in a particular project, whatever it is,
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.940]   I dedicate all of myself for that period of time,
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.660]   whatever it is, whether it be 20 minutes
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.420]   or whether it be five hours, whatever it is.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.740]   Total focus and no outside distraction whatsoever.
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.180]   And when I leave that process,
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.260]   I do my best not to think about it when I'm away from it.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.660]   I don't bring any materials with me.
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.460]   I don't leave the studio with works in progress
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.740]   and spend time listening to them during the day
[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.500]   or looking for ideas.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.340]   I stay as far away from it
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.860]   when I'm not directly engaging in it as possible.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.900]   And in the best of situations,
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.260]   I have something else to totally engage myself in,
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.080]   in between.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.100]   So instead of working on project A for five hours
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.380]   and then leaving and doing nothing,
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.020]   I'm hoping to engage in a project B or B, C and D
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.700]   with all of myself before going back to project A again,
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.900]   which might be the next day, let's say.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.900]   - So this relates to an amazing chapter
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.140]   and series of writings of your book
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.180]   that I'm not going to describe
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.260]   because I want people to find it for themselves
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.660]   about disengaging, about disengaging from the process.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.700]   One question I had as I read that chapter
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.620]   and as you're saying this now is,
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.900]   even though you're disengaged,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.140]   do you believe that your subconscious is working it through?
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.060]   - I believe so, I believe so.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.660]   And I think in general to stew over a problem
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.900]   is not the way to solve a problem.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.300]   Think to hold the problems lightly.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.820]   And when I say a problem,
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.260]   you know, when we're starting a project,
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.120]   there's usually this feeling of,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.940]   there's a question mark at the beginning of every project.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.340]   I'm always anxious when I start a new project
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.420]   because I have no idea what's going to happen.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.420]   I never know.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.140]   I never, I never, I may have in some cases
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.140]   a potential backup plan if, you know, if nothing works.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.660]   But I really try not even to have that.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.480]   I prefer not to have that.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.500]   I prefer to go in, maybe to calm myself down
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.300]   enough to be able to show up.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.940]   There'll be an idea of like, nothing works.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.780]   Maybe we could try something like this.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.100]   But that would only be for my own anxiety.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.340]   That would, it wouldn't be for actual practical use.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.940]   But there's always a sense of anxiety
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.020]   because I know whatever's going to happen
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.660]   is completely out of my control.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.660]   Something's going to,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.360]   something either interesting or not will appear.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.140]   And then we're going to follow that wherever it goes.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.020]   And until something appears for us to follow
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.020]   I have a lot of anxiety, even though it has never not come,
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.380]   you know, it has come every time,
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.980]   but there's something about it.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.140]   'Cause I also feel like there might be expectation on me
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.260]   that I'm going to make it happen.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.660]   And I know that's not happening.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.020]   That's not how it works.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.020]   It's, it's, I show up ready for it to happen
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   and I'm open to whatever we have to do
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260]   to find that first thread.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.420]   And once we find the thread, then it's like,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.980]   okay, we have a, and that thread may lead us to anything,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.820]   you know, could lead us to
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.100]   in a million different directions,
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.220]   but something about having that glimmer
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.260]   that it's not a blank, we're not looking at a blank page.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.560]   You know, we're looking at, okay, we have a,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.780]   we have the beginnings of, I would say a map,
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.540]   but it's a map that we don't know where it takes us.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.820]   And it's just the beginning.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.380]   It's just like, it's just to start, you know,
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.700]   you are here.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.500]   If you have a map and it says you are here,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.540]   even if you can't see the directions,
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.540]   knowing where we are feels okay.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.300]   And once we get, and usually, again,
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.940]   usually in the first day, first couple of days, it happens.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.940]   But up until then,
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.740]   it's really an anxiety producing situation.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.660]   (upbeat music)
