[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.400]   - All right, next question's from Overwhelmed from Toronto.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.660]   I'm very thankful for your advice
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.400]   that podcasts should focus on research.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.080]   - Postdocs. - Postdocs.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.280]   - It changes the tenor of this question quite a bit.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.040]   - However, I find I am in the middle
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.620]   of too many non-primary author projects,
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.040]   leading me to work on my primary projects
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.360]   in the evenings and on weekends.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.000]   I tried setting up autopilot, fixed schedule,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.580]   but I have no time to do it all.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.960]   How do prolific professors, you included,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.920]   balance so many projects when I find
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.960]   I can't even handle four at a time?
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.480]   - Well, four at a time's too many projects,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.120]   and we don't do that many projects at a time.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.800]   So I think what's going on here, Overwhelmed,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.420]   is that you might be suffering from what I like to call
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.820]   the time compression fallacy,
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.360]   which is typical when you're surveying from a distance
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.600]   the resumes of someone who's very accomplished.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.040]   What we tend to do when we do this is we see
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.880]   all in one place this list of all these different things
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.640]   that they have done, and then in our mind,
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.440]   when we imagine that person doing this work,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.080]   we compress the time in which this work unfolded
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.300]   so that in our mind's eye, we imagine this person
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.040]   working on lots of these things all at the same time.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.000]   This used to come up so common when I used to write
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.560]   about very successful students that I had a phrase
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320]   I used to say, I called it the paradox
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.040]   of the relaxed Rhodes Scholar.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040]   I did a study once where I interviewed
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.720]   a bunch of Rhodes Scholars, and a lot of this
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.000]   got integrated into my first book, "How to Win at College,"
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.840]   which came out back in 2005.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.220]   What I learned from these Rhodes Scholars
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.040]   is that from the perspective of other students,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.080]   they had all these different things they had done,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.520]   and so you assume they'd be very, very busy,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.560]   but when you interview them, they weren't.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.200]   And the secret to this was, yeah, I did these six things
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960]   which look incredibly impressive when you see
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.040]   the press release about me winning a Rhodes Scholarship,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.600]   but I didn't do them at the same time.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.320]   This is over four years.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.880]   It added up to a lot.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.560]   But at any one point, I wasn't doing all of these things.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.200]   So that's the time compression fallacy in action,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.360]   and we see it through all sorts of different stages
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.280]   of people's careers, all sorts of different career fields.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.360]   So if you look at my own academic life, for example,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.600]   I have published a lot of peer-reviewed
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.460]   computer science papers.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460]   I had to do all this math recently
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.000]   because I'm submitting my application for full professor.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.720]   I published something like 80,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840]   80 peer-reviewed computer science papers.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.120]   They've been cited something like 4,500 times.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.960]   For those who know the lingo,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.300]   it's generated an H-index of 31.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.600]   You read that all at once, and you think, my God,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.040]   you must be just writing all sorts of papers all the time.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.240]   But if you actually go back through my timeline,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.140]   through the now almost 20 years
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.280]   that I've been a professional academic,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.120]   what you see is that, no, no, what I learned,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.040]   this is the method I learned at MIT,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.640]   was just constant practical progress.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440]   Always be working on a paper or two.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.840]   When you finish one, work on another.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.560]   Just make that the background,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.960]   that's the background hum of your life,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.900]   is like you're always working on a paper.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.520]   You're not working on five at once.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.600]   You're working on one or two at once.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.780]   But if you're always are working on things, it adds up.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.020]   This comes out, that comes out, this one comes out.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.040]   And over time, it adds up to the 80 or 90 papers
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.720]   or whatever it is that seems really impressive.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   But if you zoom in on Cal in 2007 as a grad student at MIT,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   I didn't have that much else, much going on.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.200]   Like I worked on this one paper for a couple hours today.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.800]   Now, what am I gonna do?
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.400]   You just repeat that over enough years though,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.240]   and a lot of things add up.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.500]   So overwhelmed, people don't do as much work
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.040]   at the same time as you think.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.200]   In fact, the paradox here is if you try to do too much
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.080]   at the same time, you sabotage those projects.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.000]   They sabotage each other because you're pulling
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.860]   from too scarce of a cognitive resource
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.160]   and you end up producing less overall.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.520]   Working on less things at a time
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.320]   can actually help you produce more.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.880]   So you need to do less.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.580]   You have too many projects.
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.360]   Your issue here is not that you haven't properly
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.840]   autopilot scheduled, that you haven't properly
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.480]   fixed scheduled all of this work so that it works.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.240]   Your issue is you have too much work to schedule.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.920]   As a postdoc, you can't be doing four papers at once.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.720]   You wanna cut that down to two,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840]   maybe one primary paper and one non-primary paper.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.000]   You don't work on any more than one on a given day
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.240]   and you stick with a paper until it's done
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.760]   or at a milestone where there's gonna be
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.040]   a long period of time until you can return from it.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.640]   So whatever, we have to now wait two months
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.600]   to get back results from a lab.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.040]   And then you can switch to something else.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.400]   The key here is not gonna be quantity at any one time,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.240]   but just making sure that you're continually
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.920]   working on something and as soon as something is done,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.360]   you start working on something else.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.460]   That's how real piles of impressive accomplishment build up.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.460]   Very impressive people are actually less overloaded
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.960]   than you might imagine, unless like me,
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.440]   they for some reason have seven jobs,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.760]   but that's a different problem.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.600]   Don't do that.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.920]   (upbeat music)
