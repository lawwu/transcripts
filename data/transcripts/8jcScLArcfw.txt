[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   I don't wanna say it's a mistake.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   I think perhaps somewhat oversimplification
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.080]   of how people conceptualize dopamine's role in the brain
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.480]   is even though it's a major important role
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.340]   is for it to be active and released
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.280]   during highly reinforcing experiences like sex,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.400]   like really good food, like drugs of abuse.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.360]   It also can get activated subdivisions of the system
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.840]   during painful stimuli and during aversive stimuli,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.040]   which again are really important for you to be aware of
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.520]   to say, "Oh my God, that's really bad for me."
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.700]   And so the dopamine system, this reward circuitry
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.700]   and its subcomponents that maybe perhaps signal more salience
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.680]   or aversion in the environment are closely tied
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.960]   to arousal systems and memory systems.
