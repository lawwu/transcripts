[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Today's episode is mature in its theme, so heads up to parents with young ears in the
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   car or in the house around.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.040]   It's mature in its themes, and I say that not simply because we're talking about sexual
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.040]   sin today.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   That's part of it.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.680]   It's also mature because we're going to be talking about the revolting nature of sexual
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.080]   sin and what it says about us as sinners.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.600]   So if you don't think that sexual sin degrades our human dignity, or if you don't think that
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.080]   sexual sins insult God, then you too are likely not mature enough for this episode either.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.920]   That's also what I mean when I say that this episode is for a mature audience.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.720]   Our question comes from a young man.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.920]   He doesn't give us his name, but here's what he writes.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.240]   "Dear Pastor John, I've come to a sad point in my life where I am willing to sin without
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.240]   repenting.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.400]   I've fallen into the sin of having sex out of marriage, of my own selfish wants and desires.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.680]   This has caused me to seek out sexual pleasure through pornography and other people in private.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.040]   Though I realize the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual damage it does to me, and I've
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.240]   seen these effects very clearly in my life, I don't seem to have the will to stop.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.360]   I've read on excommunication throughout Scripture in Matthew 18, 1 Timothy 1, 1 Corinthians
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.560]   5, and I realize it's mainly a last resort for the church to discipline a believer.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.640]   I have not been contributing to my local church nor the body of Christ as a whole.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.560]   My question is, should I take the first steps in resigning and excommunicating myself from
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   the church because of my own sin?
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.580]   Though this breaks my heart to think about, I would rather dwell in my sin alone than
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.680]   claim Christ in public, all the while still blaspheming his name in my heart."
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.320]   Let me try to come at this question from two different angles.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.120]   The first is a simple and straightforward answer to the question, "Should I take the
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.780]   first steps in resigning and excommunicating myself from the church because of my sin?"
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:13.180]   The second angle I want to come at it from is a plea and a warning, an urgent warning
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.820]   that I want to give to this young man and to many like him who are sinning and describe
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.160]   themselves as not having the will to stop.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.240]   And I want to make this wider appeal and give a wider warning because in recent weeks I
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.640]   have received several other communications besides this question where men are describing
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.920]   themselves as victims of the power of temptation over which they cannot triumph.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.480]   In this particular case, he describes, hear his words, the mental, emotional, physical,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.120]   and spiritual damage he's doing to himself, he says, and even goes so far as to say that
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.960]   he's blaspheming the Lord's name in his behavior, in his heart attitude, and it's
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   all sin and he knows it.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.840]   So those are the two angles from which I want to address this man.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.760]   So first, a simple, I think straightforward answer to the question, "Should I excommunicate
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.680]   myself from the church?"
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.280]   And the answer is no, you shouldn't.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.520]   That's not what you should do.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.380]   You should, number one, make no provision for the flesh, Romans 13, 14.
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.360]   You know how the enemy approaches you.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.920]   Cut off his path before he gets there.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.840]   Block him before he arrives.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.100]   Don't walk along the precipice where you know he pushes you over.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.500]   Get out of the river before the current surges toward that deadly rapids that he's drugged
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.280]   you through so often.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.580]   Second, go to your pastors and tell them everything that you are doing, all the sin.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.040]   Just tell them, "Confess your sins," the Bible says, "to one another."
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.880]   Ask them to help you and pray for you and fight with you.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.760]   And if you remain in sin, it's their responsibility to lead the church to excommunicate you, not
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   yourself.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   It's not your job.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.160]   The goal is not to get excommunicated.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.720]   The goal is victory over destructive sin.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   You do your part.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.800]   Let them do their part.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.000]   That's my first angle.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.200]   Straightforward answer, no, self-excommunication is not what you should do.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:10.800]   But mainly I want to say to this brother and so many like him, it is not noble to be a
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:21.560]   slave or a dog returning to his vomit or a washed pig rolling around in the mud.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.040]   That's not noble or admirable or cool.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.240]   Let that sink in.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.000]   Just say that to yourself.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.160]   In 2 Peter 2.19, it says, "Those who promise freedom through sin are themselves slaves
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.800]   of corruption, for whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved."
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.840]   Slaves, slaves.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.120]   Let it sink in, brother.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   Slaves.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.480]   Is that the identity that you want that has power over you?
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   I'm a slave.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.360]   Hey, everybody, listen up.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.880]   I'm a slave.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.680]   And three verses later, Peter gets even more graphic and says, "The dog returns to his
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   own vomit and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire."
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.080]   Hey, everybody, this is my identity.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.400]   I'm a dog eating my vomit.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.120]   Come watch me eat my vomit.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   I'm a pig.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.160]   That's what I'm asking you.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.680]   I'm really asking you, is that worth it?
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:47.960]   You get 30 minutes of pre-orgasmic euphoria and 30 seconds of orgasmic pleasure and then
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.720]   days of feeling as noble as a dog in heat while the pressure builds to roll back into
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.240]   the mud like a pig with no soul.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   Let it sink in.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240]   Say it.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.640]   Preach it to yourself.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.320]   Is that the kind of human being you are willing to be?
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.720]   The reason the Bible describes your condition over and over as deception is so that you
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.920]   will feel like a fool, a fool.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.760]   And you refuse, absolutely refuse to be a dupe any longer, won't you?
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   I mean, nobody wants to be a fool, a dupe, a lackey.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.160]   To be content with being made a fool by Satan?
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   Really?
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.640]   Come on.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.760]   Consider 2 Thessalonians 2.9.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:49.600]   The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all deception.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.720]   There's the keyword.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.520]   Deception of wickedness for those who are perishing because they did not welcome a love
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.680]   for the truth so as to be saved.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.760]   Deception of wickedness.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   Let it sink in.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.400]   Wickedness deceives.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.680]   It makes promises and snickers while you buy it.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.880]   Lock stock and barrel.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880]   Deceived.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.440]   That's how Satan does it.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   He tricks you.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.680]   He dupes you.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.360]   He makes a fool out of you.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.440]   The Bible talks like this.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.120]   This is Bible talk, not Piper talk.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.200]   This is Bible talk.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.720]   So wake up and say, "I'm not going to be a fool.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.480]   I'm not going to be a slave.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.520]   I'm not going to be a dog or a pig.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.000]   I'm a man.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.920]   So to hell with you, Satan.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.120]   Get out of my life.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.800]   I don't belong to you."
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.080]   I mean, seriously, let me be the voice of God to you for a moment.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.680]   The voice of God to Job.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   Get up.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680]   Right?
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.680]   Is that what Job says?
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.800]   I mean, God says to Job, "Get up.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.160]   Get up off your four paws.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.440]   Put on your two feet."
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.280]   I gave you two feet, not four cloven pig hoofs to roll around in the mire.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.320]   Stop sniffing around between the legs of another dog or mud and stand up on your two feet,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   not four.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.880]   I'll talk to you like a man.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.120]   Are you a man?
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.960]   Then stop acting like a dog.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.920]   I will deal with you like a man.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:32.800]   For example, Ephesians 2, "Stop walking according to the age of this world, according to the
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.280]   prince of the power of the air, in the passions of your flesh, caring about the desires of
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   the body and the mind."
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:48.740]   So stop acting like a spiritual dead man, a zombie slave with a hook in your nose, led
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.400]   around by the spirit of the age and Satan and your own animal passions.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.760]   I'm pleading with you.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.240]   I'm really pleading with you.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.320]   Let these words sink in.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.280]   I don't think you want to be a slave.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.640]   Really, answer me.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.840]   I wish you could talk to me.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   Do you want to be a slave?
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.200]   Do you want to be a dog, a pig?
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:18.280]   Seriously, you are being deceived, made a fool of, and you're willing to throw in the
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   towel?
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.120]   No, don't throw in the towel.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:31.720]   Are you really willing to let Satan make a fool of you, a lackey, a flunky, a powerless,
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.840]   helpless slave to your genitals?
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.100]   Really, come on, let this sink in.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:44.080]   You do not want to let that be your identity.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:51.220]   If you want to concede defeat before Satan and the spirit of the age and the animal drives
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.560]   of your body, you are being duped.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.840]   You are being made a fool of, and I'm crying out to you in this APJ.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.560]   I'm crying out to you.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   Wake up.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   You're not a dog.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   You're a man.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.440]   You're not made in the image of a pig.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.560]   You're made in the image of God.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.280]   Stand up and strike your sin.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:22.940]   Listen, Christian man, not just you, but all of you, listen.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.280]   You were bought with a price.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.560]   The agonizing blood of Jesus was the price.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.620]   You're not your own.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.040]   Your body is not yours.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   It's Christ's.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.520]   It exists for his glory, not mud.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:42.880]   It exists to make Christ look magnificent, not for humping around on the back of stray
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.320]   dogs.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:51.400]   You do not want to concede defeat and just roll over into the mud and say, "I'm a pig.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   I'm a dog.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.080]   I guess that's just the way I'll be.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   I'm a fool."
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   No, no.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   Here's the word of God for you.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.600]   Confront yourselves to God.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   Resist the devil.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.240]   He will flee from you.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.400]   Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.840]   Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.880]   Be wretched and mourn and weep.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.760]   Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.200]   Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.840]   James 4, 7-10.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.120]   Did you hear that last phrase?
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.400]   That's amazing.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.960]   He will exalt you.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.400]   Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   Yes, he will.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   Think of it.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.000]   What does that mean?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.200]   God wants you exalted.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.160]   That's what it means.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.620]   It says he will exalt you.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.480]   He wants to exalt you.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   Do you hear that?
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:53.000]   Not slave-like, dog-like, pig-like, deceived fools jumping from one orgasm to the next.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.520]   Don't roll over in defeat.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.800]   Tell Satan where to go.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.560]   Pick up the sword of the Spirit.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   Run him through.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   You're a man.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.880]   Christ has said he will be with you to the end.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.800]   He will help you.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.360]   If God is for you, who can be against you?
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.360]   So wake up, Christian friend.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.300]   You are not destined for the fleeting pleasures of destructive sin.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:27.320]   You are destined in Christ for fullness of joy and pleasure at God's right hand forevermore.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.920]   Sobering.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.280]   Hard words, cutting words like a surgery.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.440]   Cuts meant to heal with an awesome, a truly awesome offer at the end.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.000]   Thank you for this, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.

[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:54.920]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   [END]
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   1.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   What is the purpose of the Holy Spirit?
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   2.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   What is the purpose of Jesus Christ?
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   3.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   What is the purpose of the Holy Spirit?
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920]   4.
