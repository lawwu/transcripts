[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.160]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.040]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.960]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.680]   For a while, I've been fascinated by minimalism and I knew I wanted to do an
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.440]   episode about it.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.320]   While I don't think I'm anywhere close to being a hoarder, I definitely
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.600]   struggle with getting rid of things that I might need or want to use one day.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.080]   Well, a few weeks ago, I got connected with Joshua Becker and I knew that our
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.640]   conversation would make for a great episode.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.800]   For those of you who don't know him, he's the founder of Becoming Minimalist, a
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.880]   website that's helped inspired millions of visitors around the world.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   He's also the best-selling author of The More of Less, The Minimalist Home, and
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.560]   most recently, Things That Matter, Overcoming Distractions to Pursue a More
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.520]   Meaningful Life.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.200]   It just came out last week, and it's a fantastic read.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.520]   In our conversation, we'll talk about what most people get wrong about
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.560]   minimalism, why owning less can bring more meaning to life, ways to get started
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.200]   without jumping straight into the deep end, and the big distractions outside of
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.760]   just stuff that get in the way of focusing on the things that matter in life.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.320]   Joshua, thank you for being here.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.480]   Well, thank you for having me here.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.120]   It's a pleasure.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   So I'm going to jump right in.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.440]   What do you think most people get wrong when they think about minimalism?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.040]   Well, I've been writing about minimalism for 13 years or so, and I think when I
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.480]   first started, the misconceptions were this was going to be a barren, empty...
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.440]   I think we kind of shaken that misconception quite a bit.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.600]   The misconception that I fight against the most is that minimalism is about
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.280]   checking out of life.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.680]   That minimalism is about quitting my job as soon as I possibly can, not
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.160]   contributing anything to the world, and just laying on a beach for the rest of
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.800]   my life.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.040]   In my mind, minimalism is about removing physical distractions, removing
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.320]   possessions so that I can live a bigger life that accomplishes more good for the
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.280]   world than if I was carrying around a bunch of stuff that I didn't need.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.720]   Why is it so important, especially right now, for people to think this way?
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.240]   Because never at any point in human history have human beings owned as much
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.600]   stuff as we do now.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.840]   Things are cheaper than ever.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.120]   Things are more accessible and more available.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.600]   And with a click of a button, I can get things delivered to my home in an hour.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.120]   The stats are pretty fascinating.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.240]   The average American home has tripled in size in the last 50 years and still 10%
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.560]   of Americans rent off-site storage.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.440]   The LA Times one time printed that the average American home has 300,000 items
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.120]   inside of it, and I think the more you accumulate, then the more of a physical
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.680]   burden, the more of a mental burden, just the more time all of our things take
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.240]   from us.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.520]   I think it's probably more important than ever to be intentional about the
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.400]   things we're allowing into our homes and lives.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.960]   I'm thinking as you say that, "Gosh, how many things are in my house?"
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.560]   I don't even know if I want to know the answer.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.960]   But you write a lot about the how of decluttering and minimization.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.800]   But it seems like the why, the internal work you have to do is almost more or
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.240]   maybe as much as important.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.800]   Is that true?
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.680]   Certainly the how.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.120]   Owning less is better than thinking about owning less.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.400]   So it's one thing to be introduced to the idea, to be drawn to the idea of
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.600]   removing distractions.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.360]   It's something completely different to actually begin walking down that road.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.560]   Whenever I help people go through this process, the first thing that I always
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.840]   have people do is sit down and answer this question, "I desire to own less so
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.880]   that I can blank."
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.760]   You fill in the blank however you want.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.840]   What is the goal?
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.720]   What is the purpose?
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.440]   For me, it was a Saturday morning, cleaning out my garage while I wish I was
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.560]   playing with my son.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.440]   I could just see how all the things I owned were distracting me and taking me
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.680]   away from spending time with my family.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.560]   I literally just want to spend more time with my family.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.280]   But other people, they want to own less so you can travel more or you can
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.800]   retire early or get out of debt or there's environmental reasons behind
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.600]   your pursuit.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.880]   But nailing the why I think is pretty important because the goal of
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.760]   minimalism is never just to own the fewest amount of things as possible.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.560]   Minimalism is always just a means to an end of some sort.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.400]   And so, knowing that, number one, I think provides the motivation and the
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.040]   momentum.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.120]   For most people, decluttering their possessions is hard work, requires
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.320]   physical work and emotional work and mental work.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.080]   So, I think having that goal, knowing why they want to do it is helpful.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.960]   When I wrote my first book, The More of Less, I learned a little bit about
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.320]   publishing pretty early on.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.920]   We met in the Denver airport for lunch with some of the vice presidents and
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.280]   publishers and editors and they asked me the question, "What do you want to
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.920]   name the book?"
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.840]   And I said, "Well, I thought I'd name the book Becoming Minimalist".
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   And she said, "Well, you can't name the book Becoming Minimalist".
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   And I said, "Oh, I can't?"
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.080]   And she said, "No, Becoming Minimalist is the process that gets you somewhere".
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.040]   Like what is the promise of minimalism?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.440]   That's the title of your book, not the process, make it the promise.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.240]   I like it.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240]   The promise of The More of Less.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.520]   The More of Less, Finding the Life You Want Under Everything You Own was the
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.280]   first book and that then became the title.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.320]   That's the promise, right?
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.600]   I don't think anyone's desire in life is just to own as much stuff as they
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.400]   possibly can.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.560]   We certainly have bigger dreams for our lives than that.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.160]   Of course.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.440]   When it comes to the how, what are the hacks to actually do that?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.800]   So, let's say I've decided, okay, now I don't want a lot of stuff.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   Do you have any advice to someone who's gone through the process to find their
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.600]   why?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.760]   Do they do it gradually or all at once?
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.480]   There are some people who can do it all in a weekend.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.200]   I know a friend who, as soon as he heard about minimalism, rented a dumpster and
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   was like done by the end of the day.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.320]   But that's a pretty small percentage of people.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.000]   Although if you can pull it off and if that's your type of personality, then
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.360]   it's certainly better than taking six or nine months to declutter your home.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.000]   But if you're married and you got two kids and you got 15 years of stuff in
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.040]   your home, then it probably takes a little more time and a little more effort.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.920]   The strategy that I use, the method that I have found to be the most helpful for
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.400]   the most number of people is to work through your home easiest to hardest,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.760]   starting with the most lived in areas.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.880]   So, some folks would say category by category, but I think room by room.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:48.560]   And don't fall into the trap of starting minimizing possessions by going to the
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.760]   hardest room that you'll ever have to complete.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.120]   Because a lot of people hear about decluttering and they're like that's right,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.800]   I got to go through my garage, I got to go through my attic or the basement.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.480]   And then you go spend an hour and a half in the basement and you don't see any
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   progress at the end of the day and you feel frustrated, throw up your hands and
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.160]   give up, this is never going to work for me.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:18.800]   But you could go spend 15 minutes in your car and totally change the inside of your
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   car the very next time you get in it.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.880]   Or you could spend an hour and a half in your living room or your bedroom or your
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.600]   bathroom and you could notice a change by the end of the day.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.840]   And that mental movement of seeing progress and seeing that you're making
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.160]   changes then motivates you to go tackle the next space and the next space and the
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.800]   next space.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.680]   So, easiest to hardest, most lived in areas first.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.200]   And by that I mean, maybe the guest bedroom is the easiest thing for you to
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.280]   declutter in your home, but you're never in the guest bedroom, so you never see
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.640]   the progress, you never feel like you're making any changes.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.080]   So, I would tell people to go start in their car, just take everything out of
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.680]   your car that you don't need.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.920]   The next time you get in your car, see how it makes you feel.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.400]   I can guarantee you'll love it a lot more than having the empty water bottle
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   rolling around in the back seat the whole time.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.840]   I like that.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.920]   I will take the car on as a project.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.480]   There you go.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.120]   This weekend.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.520]   I've heard you talk about the concept of staging your home for living.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.040]   I heard you say the final moments of owning your home is when you finally try to
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.400]   make it look exactly right.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.040]   And some of the principles of staging you've applied to staging your home for
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.920]   living.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.960]   Is that something you could talk about a little bit and walk people through that
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.840]   mindset change?
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.920]   I've moved several times in my life and with each of the times, literally you're
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:43.680]   like doing all the things in your home that you wanted to do all along and your
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.360]   home is like the best place that you've ever had it since the day you moved in,
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.560]   the day you move out.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:54.000]   And so, trying to incorporate some of those thinkings of not always major
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.400]   renovations, but if you got a leaky sink, like you got to fix it at some point.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.160]   So, why not just fix it now?
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.240]   So, you don't have a leaky sink because although the housing market is a little
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.360]   bit different these days, but typically you're going to have to fix the sink
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.640]   before you're going to move out anyway.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.760]   So, you might as well do it.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.960]   The reason I have this phrasing and I like to talk about this is one of the
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.760]   things that almost every realtor will have you do before you go sell your house
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.240]   is take out a third or two thirds of the possessions in it.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.280]   Like literally tell you to go rent a storage unit and just get all this stuff
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.240]   out of the house so it feels more peaceful and it feels more calm and it
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.200]   feels more spacious for when someone is going through it.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.880]   I think that we need to apply the same things to the way we live in our homes today.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.360]   I talk a lot about home in The Minimalist Home, that's the second book.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.840]   Like what is the purpose of home anyway?
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.960]   I remember my editor asked me that while we were writing the book.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.760]   He said "Joshua, what is the purpose of home?"
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.040]   and I thought that is a good question.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.000]   I don't think most of us ever sit down and really ask what is the goal of my home
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.560]   and just talking it through with them, there's the part of home should be a
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.600]   place where I feel accepted and loved, it should be like a respite from the crazy
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.400]   world out there, it should be a place that helps me find calm and peace rather
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:23.200]   than add stress to my life, but the goal of home isn't to stay there forever.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.680]   I don't want my home to be calm so that I can just stay in my home for the rest
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.320]   of my life.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.520]   I want home to be a place where I can rest so that I can go live my best life
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.000]   out in the world, accomplishing the most good for the most number of people.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So, how do I create a space that accomplishes that both as a port for my
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.040]   ship but also a launch pad to go out into the world?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.320]   And not just for me and my spouse, but my kids as well.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:57.040]   Has any of the changes in the last few years from the pandemic and working from
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.920]   home changed any perspectives you had on your home and what you should do and how
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.000]   you should think about it now that lots of people ended up working from home and
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.520]   maybe some will forever?
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:16.320]   My overriding thought of going into the pandemic back two years ago now was I'm
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.880]   glad I found minimalism 12 years ago.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:28.960]   I'm glad that I had done the work of creating a home that was calm and peaceful,
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.040]   a home that I wanted to be in, a home that wasn't adding stress to my life.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.640]   Not to mention, I felt like I had saved a lot of money by pursuing minimalism and
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.000]   buying less stuff.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.280]   I felt freer, I felt less tied down to the place that I was confined to be in and
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.440]   I think some people early on were like "boy, I bet you're regretting becoming a
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.240]   minimalist now that you're stuck inside your home" and I'm like "no, just the
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.800]   opposite".
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.920]   Like I feel free, like I feel like we could get up and move if we needed to.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.120]   I felt like I had saved up some money along the ways.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.960]   It's not that my home is empty, there's still things to do in my home.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.720]   I thought I brought a lot of intentionality into my life over the last 10 years
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.600]   about how I spent my time and certainly I think the pandemic upended a lot of that
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.760]   in a lot of ways and a lot of unhealthy habits that emerged, but I thought that I
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.360]   was in a much better place to handle those and overcome them once the world slowly
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.320]   opened back up again.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.360]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.200]   is that I am definitely not.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.920]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why I
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.000]   kickstart my day with Athletic Greens and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.280]   for this episode.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.880]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I've
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.680]   kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.160]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes, it tastes so
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.480]   good when it's cold, and I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.680]   day, which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.640]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, and superfoods
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.360]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.520]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.880]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.040]   supply of immune-supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.120]   purchase.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.320]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.680]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens to take ownership over your
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.760]   health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.640]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.040]   I get it, life comes at you fast.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.080]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.120]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.160]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.720]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.560]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.400]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.520]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.360]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.000]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.960]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.040]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.200]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.120]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.440]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.240]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.280]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.360]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.120]   You mentioned you started this a little over a decade ago.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.280]   Were you always just the kind of person who didn't care about stuff and your garage was
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.280]   empty?
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.440]   You didn't buy stuff all the time and that this was easy?
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.360]   Or how was the transition for you at the kind of genesis of your approach to minimalism?
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.200]   It wasn't something that I started out doing.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.840]   I'd been married 10 years.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.360]   My son was five and my daughter was two at the time where I was introduced to minimalism.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.920]   Pretty typical, middle-class, suburban lifestyle.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.880]   I always tell the story how we had gotten three pretty significant pay increases over
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.280]   those first 10 years of marriage and yet, for some reason, we're never able to get ahead
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.680]   financially.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.640]   It always seemed like, well, now that I got that pay raise, I should be able to save everything
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.280]   new that was coming into my life, but it never worked out that way.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.880]   It seemed like the more money came in, the more money went out.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.160]   And then it wasn't until - yeah, my son was five, my daughter was two and literally on
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.640]   a Saturday morning, we were living in Vermont at the time and just our typical spring cleaning,
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.760]   I went out to clean the garage and it ended up just taking hours of organizing stuff and
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:15.120]   getting rid of stuff and cleaning things out and my son was in the backyard asking me to
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.320]   come play and I kept pushing him off.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.080]   Just this constant "no, no, one more minute, I'm almost done, I'm almost done, we'll play.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.120]   We'll play as soon as I'm done".
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.080]   And it was my neighbor who introduced me to minimalism as I think I was complaining a
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.920]   little bit about how much effort had gone into the garage.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.120]   She says "you know, that's why my daughter's a minimalist, she keeps telling me I don't
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.400]   need to own all this stuff".
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.520]   Looking at the pile of things in my driveway and there's my son swinging alone on the swing
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.680]   set in the backyard and suddenly realized all the things I owned weren't making me happy,
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.440]   which we would all say but even more, all those things were distracting me and taking
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.480]   me away from the thing that did bring me happiness and joy and meaning and life and so, that
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   was it.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.800]   Was it difficult for me?
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   No, it wasn't.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.840]   I saw the bigger picture right away.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.480]   I could see pretty clearly how owning less stuff would free me up to invest my life in
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.680]   things that actually matter.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.840]   It took about six or nine months, so there was certainly effort that had to go into it
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.320]   and tough decisions that needed to be made but I certainly wasn't drug into the lifestyle
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   kicking and screaming.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.200]   I was pretty excited about the opportunity right away.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.400]   I imagine most people listening are thinking "I'm on board, I've already thought for the
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.760]   last 10 minutes about what my why is".
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.240]   But I feel like when the rubber hits the road and you're like "Okay, now I got to start
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.800]   getting rid of things", I can already run through my head the story I'd have for almost
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.920]   everything that I probably should get rid of and haven't.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.440]   And in my particular life, there's one thing that between my wife and I is like this.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.680]   She's much more the "throw everything away" or "give it away" or "we don't need this".
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:56.080]   And I have maybe a common attitude of like "Well, one day, what if we want this thing?"
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.360]   And the one that comes to mind every time is someone gave us a raclette, just like a
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.820]   little grill on the top and it heats up cheese and you'd use it when you have your friends
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.920]   over for dinner.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.840]   And we have this thing and in 10 years, we've maybe used it once.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   And she would make the argument "If we don't use this more than that, it's got to go".
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.640]   And I'm like "Well, we have the room in the house and maybe one day we'll need it.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.880]   I'm going to be really bummed when I say we should do this one time and we don't have
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   it.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.880]   Then what do I do?
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.880]   Do I buy it?
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.960]   Like, I imagine I'm not the only person that has this challenge of like "I might want this
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.320]   thing one day, so I shouldn't get rid of it".
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.120]   Well, this specific one, heating up cheese, you are the first one ever, by the way.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.520]   I don't even know what this is.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.040]   There's no other way to heat up cheese except for this one little tool.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.100]   It's a device you would put on the table to eat with people and cook food together versus
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.840]   something you'd use in the pantry.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.040]   But it could very easily be a fondue set.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.280]   So we could pretend it's a fondue set.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   Got it.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:04.560]   This would be a classic example of "I'm in for owning less and my mind races to the hardest
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.600]   thing in my home that I would ever have to get rid of".
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.760]   And I don't want to shirk the responsibility of this question here, but honestly, what
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:19.180]   I would tell you, what I would tell anyone else is I would say "Don't start by getting
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:25.080]   rid of the hardest thing in your home that you would ever have to get rid of".
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:32.020]   I just did an interview earlier with someone who had like a Pringles can that they got
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.780]   from their grandfather who taught them how to invest money and this was where he saved
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.780]   his money.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.800]   I'm like "Well, you don't start by getting rid of the Pringles can, let's just find some
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.840]   things in your home that you know you don't need, you know you don't use, maybe you have
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:53.200]   duplicates of the item, maybe you have something else that could accomplish the exact same
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.000]   thing, maybe it's something that was from a different season of life that you no longer
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.760]   use anymore, like let's find easier wins, let's make quicker progress and then start
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:12.440]   noticing how owning less frees up your life for bigger and better things and just notice
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.520]   the change that's taking place in what happens when you walk in your home, how much less
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:23.000]   time you have to spend cleaning or organizing, how much money you're saving by not buying
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.320]   stuff that you don't need, how much more life is enjoyable when everything you own is your
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:35.160]   favorite of something rather than a closet full of clothes that you only wear 20% of
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.240]   them anyway.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:42.200]   Like start noticing some of those benefits and then when you get to the fondue set, you'll
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:49.520]   be in a better place and maybe you've decluttered a lot more and now having people over is something
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.000]   that's becoming more important to you and your home is cleaner and so, it's easier to
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.640]   do and you're like "No, showing hospitality and having people over is an important value
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.880]   to us and this fondue set allows us to do that" and so, you're going to keep it or maybe
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.560]   you're going to be like "You know what?
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.640]   This is kind of stupid that I was holding on to this thing and now that I think about
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.860]   it, I do have a friend and I could borrow his if I desperately needed it at some point
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.460]   in the future".
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.120]   What you just said about borrowing something comes to mind with the most common objection
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.880]   I would think of going through my house.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.440]   There are a lot of things that I don't actually have an attachment to, but I think in the
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.520]   back of my mind "Well, one day what if I need this thing, a basketball.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.360]   It's like I own a basketball.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.020]   I don't play basketball a lot, but I know there's a park down the street with a basketball.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.520]   If I wanted to play basketball one day, I don't really want to go buy a basketball".
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.080]   So what about when it's not that it's an emotional attachment?
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.520]   It's not a hard thing to get rid of, but it's just something that you think "Well, one day
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.820]   I might need this and I don't want to buy it then, so I want to keep it".
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.820]   One option you just gave which is maybe someone you know has one to borrow, is there anything
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.880]   else to help people get over that hurdle of "I might need this someday"?
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.160]   I mean, there's just some math that we can do in our heads like "What are the probabilities
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.640]   of me needing a basketball?
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.520]   How hard would it be to replace?
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.720]   How much really would it cost if I needed to replace it?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.000]   What is my financial situation if that was required?"
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.440]   The question we typically ask ourselves is "Yeah, but what if I need it someday?"
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.400]   And I always think there's another side to that question.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.840]   And the other side of that question is "What if I hold on to everything for the rest of
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.720]   my life and never end up using it?"
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:41.880]   There's more than just a financial cost to the things that we buy and the things that
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   we own.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.760]   Like everything we own takes up physical space in our home and it takes up mental space in
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   our mind.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.680]   Randy Alcorn says "Every increased possession adds increased anxiety onto our lives".
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.120]   Even if it's just like a little bit in the back of your head "Oh yeah, I've got that
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.960]   basketball, I gotta decide what I'm gonna do with it at some point".
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.280]   Once we start making these changes, maybe there's some kid down the street who could
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.040]   be using that basketball every single day if he just knew that there was one out there.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.600]   And so, there's a cost to holding on to things that we don't always consider.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.600]   I'll share a story that goes in the positive for my clutter lifestyle which I wouldn't
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.780]   say I have necessarily, but we got rid of a lot of stuff when we moved and we moved
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.640]   into a house that had a lot of storage in the garage and we realized we maybe didn't
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.180]   need all of it.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.760]   And so, by getting rid of a lot of the storage in the garage, we thought "Wow, we actually
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.440]   have enough room here that we could put a spin bike in the garage and now we could exercise
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   more".
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.200]   And so, for us, getting rid of some stuff enabled us to use the space differently.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.800]   In a weird way, it almost like gave us an extra room in our house.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.440]   So, I'll just share that as something that for us worked to our advantage to getting
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.440]   rid of stuff.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   Do I have a ways to go?
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.440]   I'm sure.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.360]   This is another struggle I come to.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.920]   I know you have a perspective on this is "Gosh, I have this thing.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.360]   I could probably sell this thing on eBay and it's worth more than zero.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.280]   So I should probably make sure that I sell it."
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.400]   But the overhead and actually selling something is really high and I don't want to go hire
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.880]   someone at a sell it again store because now they're gonna take 20% and I'm perfectly capable.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.840]   And so, 6 years later, I still have this iPhone that now is worth $50.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   It used to be worth a few hundred dollars and had I just either given it away or sold
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.160]   it at the time, it would have been a better outcome.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.160]   But the overhead of dealing with it meant that it just piled up.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.840]   What do you tell people who are trying to optimize "I have all this stuff, I'm down
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   to get rid of it.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.680]   I've gotten over it emotionally, but I want to sell it and that takes up so much overhead"?
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:48.840]   Generosity brings benefits into our lives that money doesn't.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:55.360]   And if the question is "should I be donating all these things or should I be trying to
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.960]   sell everything?"
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:03.680]   My advice is unless you desperately need the money, just donate the stuff.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.960]   Find a local charity that's supporting a problem that you want to solve in the world, if it's
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:15.800]   homelessness or refugee resettlement or battered women's clinic or foster children in the system,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.300]   there's a benefit that comes to just donating some of that stuff.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:26.240]   If you're trying to declutter a lot of stuff, then selling everything just adds time and
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.200]   energy and stress to an already pretty difficult process.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   And we don't typically make nearly as much money as we think we're going to.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.600]   There's a time and a space if you're getting rid of something really valuable or something
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.360]   really big and you don't have a truck to haul it away, but if you don't desperately need
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.480]   the money already, I think it's better just to donate.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:55.320]   I actually find that when you start donating things, it tends to almost prompt more and
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   more minimizing of things as opposed to trying to sell it.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.600]   So, like when we started, my son was five, my daughter was two, we were done having children,
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:13.240]   and we had a basement full of maternity clothes and like baby things and crib and a high chair,
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.300]   like stuff that my daughter had just outgrown.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:23.200]   And I remember we tried to sell it at a garage sale and like hardly any of it sold.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:29.680]   And so, I called my neighbor who I knew worked at the Care Net Pregnancy Center in Burlington,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.920]   Vermont, just down the road from us.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.080]   I'm like "hey, we have all this baby stuff, I was just going to take it to Goodwill, but
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.940]   is this stuff that you could use?"
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.680]   And I remember like I'll never forget it, she's like "yeah, we can use that, that's
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.400]   exactly what we do.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.680]   Like we work with families in poverty, we work with single mothers and we give them
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:58.240]   maternity clothes, baby clothes, high chairs, cribs, bottles, blankets, like the whole deal".
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.160]   And I was like "man, I guess I never knew what you did or I never knew how much of a
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.880]   need there was in the community".
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   And we went into our basement and we found more boxes of stuff that we didn't need.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.560]   And we're like "man, if there's someone in the community that can be using this stuff
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.880]   like right now, why in the world would we let it just collect dust in our basement?"
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.680]   So, I think generosity and donating can help us to get rid of even more and more.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.600]   If anyone listening has probably already heard me talk about the book Happy Money, which
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.080]   it now turns out I learned there are two.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.160]   So, the one by Elizabeth Dunn, one of the five things that I guess science has shown
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.480]   that at least this is spending money on, but I think the principles apply is spending money
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.360]   on others and giving money away.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.640]   So, certainly the same principle I think would apply to things and...
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   What are the other four?
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.600]   Because I always just list three things that science says we can spend our money on to
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   make us happy.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   But do you remember?
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   I shouldn't be putting you on the spot.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.880]   So, there are ways that you can spend money.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.400]   So, one is making things a treat.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.280]   So, if you buy a latte every day, maybe consider buying the latte once a month or buying it
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.560]   once a week to make it a surprise.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.080]   One is pre-paying for things.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.560]   It's kind of like pay now, consume later.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.080]   If you're going on a vacation, see if you can call the hotel and pay for the entire
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:19.020]   stay in advance so that when you end your hotel stay, your final experience isn't looking
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.640]   at this bill that was a few thousand dollars.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.200]   I said invest in others.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.560]   It's fun.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.560]   I love being put on the spot.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.560]   One is buying time.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.200]   So, if there's a thing you don't love, if you hate cleaning your house, spend money.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.640]   I imagine that's one that you've done.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.000]   And then the last is probably one we've all heard, which is buying experiences.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.560]   All right.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.840]   I have the bottom three.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.320]   Whenever I talk about the three ways you can spend money that increase happiness, experiences
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.920]   over possessions, buying time and being generous with our money.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   But I have...
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   Yeah, the other two.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   First two.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   Pay now, consume later and make it a treat.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   All right.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   Let's talk about it.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.080]   Those are a lot of the roadblocks.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.960]   And I appreciate talking through them because I imagine a lot of people have come to this
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   conclusion.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.760]   The last one I want to ask about, which is interesting, because we're having another
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.520]   child in a few months.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.120]   And we were thinking about a trade-off here, which is time is of the essence.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.320]   We just talked about spending money on time is a good use of money.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.400]   One of the things that takes up a lot of time when you have a child, things get dirty all
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   the time.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.280]   Burp, claws, bibs.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.120]   So we went through this conversation at lunch today.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.840]   In advance of having this conversation, and we're like, "Gosh."
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:30.420]   Our instinct was let's overbuy the bibs so we can underspend time on laundry.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.320]   But you could make a case that we could buy three or four bibs and wash them.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.480]   Or we could buy 20 and do laundry once a week.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.320]   You just said you recommend spending money on things to buy time, but you also like owning
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.060]   fewer things.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.680]   Does the temporal nature of something like a burp cloth that you might only need for
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.800]   a year have kind of a carve out in the need for owning fewer possessions?
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.560]   Oh, that would be an interesting one.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.200]   I don't know how you'll know until you're actually in it.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.360]   What is enough?
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.140]   How much underwear should I own?
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.220]   How many pairs of shoes should I own?
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.400]   How many towels should I have in my home?
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.480]   How many square footage should I have in my home?
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.640]   I get asked everything.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:15.560]   And the answer is, you really just need to experiment in your home to find out what is
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.760]   going to work best for you.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:24.680]   My hope with possessions or my goal with possessions is that my possessions are not a burden to
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.680]   me, whether in too few or in too many.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.200]   And most of us live with more possessions than we need.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.480]   And so, it has become a burden to us and a distraction from things that matter.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.560]   But there is the case that you could have too few of something and it also becomes burdensome.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.840]   If I have to visit a laundromat and I got to go there every two days, then at that point,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   it's becoming more of a burden to have fewer burp claws or fewer clothes than it would
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.480]   be to have a week's worth that fit into one wash.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.320]   I suppose I could make the case that yeah, we're not going to use burp claws for that
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.200]   long and can donate burp claws probably, I suppose, if they're clean.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.080]   So I don't know.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.360]   I love the - what is the normal laundry routine in your family?
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   How often do you do laundry?
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.440]   Is it once a week?
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.800]   Then what's going up once you add a new human into the family, or at least there's going
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.960]   to be more of it.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   But what makes sense?
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.880]   What gets us through one cycle?
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.620]   I know there are a lot of trends in kind of minimalism and everything.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.440]   A lot of people in the past few years have talked about Marie Kondo, only keep things
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.160]   that spark joy.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.480]   Are a lot of these different things?
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.480]   Do they work together?
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.360]   Are they different paths, different sex you have to pick one to follow?
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   Can you mix and match?
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   Do you have favorites?
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.280]   Or do you think about all that's going on in the kind of broader space?
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.240]   I think we're all having a similar conversation, but getting there a different way.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:55.360]   I tend to like the questions that I have people ask and the approach that I have people go.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.960]   I tend to think, what is my purpose in life and do these possessions help me do that?
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.800]   Or are they distracting me from it?
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:08.160]   I tend to think that's a better long-term question than does this item spark joy in
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.240]   the present moment or not?
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.720]   But that being said, I've said this before, I'm for anyone who can help people own less
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:22.360]   stuff and if does it spark joy is the question that allows me to start making progress in
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   my home.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.200]   Marie is very much category by category as opposed to room by room and if that works
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.520]   for you, then I think go for it.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.200]   I tend to think that the way I encourage people to do it tends to work a little bit better,
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.120]   but I think different people can do it in different ways.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.600]   I think generally, we're all talking about owning just the things you need to own to
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.240]   live your life the best way that you possibly can.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.160]   Probably what that looks like in the end differs from person to person, but that's fine.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.080]   We're all coming at it from different viewpoints and we're all different people trying to do
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   it anyway.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.440]   Are there a few examples of the question you like to ask and particular items that you've
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.040]   talked to people about that might bring an example to light for people?
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.160]   The questions that I have people ask, number one, do I need it?
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.320]   Which is pretty common.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.280]   Number two, why do I have it?
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.040]   Number three, what would I use if I didn't have it?
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.400]   Tends to be very helpful.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:20.640]   The overarching philosophy for me is, does this item help me fulfill my purpose?
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   What are my greatest goals in life?
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.880]   Who do I want to be?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.000]   What do I want to do?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.240]   What are my values?
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:32.960]   And then, what things do I need to own to help me accomplish those values and accomplish
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.400]   those goals and what are the things that are keeping me from it?
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.240]   I learned it really early on.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.680]   There's a couple up in Portland named Logan and Tammy Strobel and they had moved out of
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.560]   their home into a tiny home and there were two of them and they just had two plates and
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.520]   they had two cups and two forks and like a hundred things between them.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.880]   Meanwhile, we were a family of four and we lived in the suburbs of Vermont.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.800]   I was working at a church at the time and we loved having people over for dinner.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:08.320]   I was doing weddings, we'd have future newlyweds over, not just to plan the wedding but to
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.560]   talk about marriage and how to make it successful and we would always have dinner.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:19.920]   And so, I remember looking at the plates and the cups and the forks and remembering Logan
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:25.880]   and Tammy just owned two, like well, we're a family of four, we need four.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:32.520]   But also, having people over is pretty important to us and something that we want to do even
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.840]   more of not less of and so, it became well, let's keep eight plates and let's keep eight
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.120]   forks and let's keep eight coffee mugs.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.480]   We only need three or four sets of eight plates and eight coffee mugs but if this is something
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.480]   that we're going to do more of, then certainly we need to have the things in place to accomplish
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   that more.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.600]   Were there a few hard items where you kind of got on the fence about, "Gosh, this one
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.280]   I don't know" that maybe went the other way?
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.040]   I learned a lot about clothes, like really changed the way I dress.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:06.920]   I tend to wear the same thing every single day now, V-neck t-shirt and pants and I just
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.840]   - I never imagined going into this that I would wear the same thing every single day
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.560]   but now that I do, I love it and would never go back to having to decide every morning
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:23.440]   what to wear because it's just one less decision that I have to make.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.480]   I feel like I could do that and probably do.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.720]   I think my wife would struggle with that a lot more.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.880]   I learned it from Courtney Carver, she writes at bemorewithless.com and she lives in Salt
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:39.760]   Lake City and I learned that whole idea from her, so I hear a lot of, "Well, that's easy
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.560]   for you because you're a guy" and I always respond, "Yeah, but I learned it from a woman",
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.320]   so that's always my approach.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.320]   Certainly different personalities look at it different ways.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.120]   So, I want to move on to your new book, Things That Matter and you wrote it to help people
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.520]   overcome distractions.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.440]   How do you think all of the work you did in minimalism and all the learnings you had brought
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.000]   you to this moment?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.540]   - That's a super helpful question because minimizing possessions was what sparked this
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:14.360]   thinking of, "Hey, how did my home fill up with all these things?
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.640]   Like, why did I have boxes full of stuff that I didn't need?
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.240]   Why did I have minivan loads full of things that I could take to Goodwill or the pregnancy
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   center?"
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:29.600]   I never set out to just spend my life buying a bunch of stuff that I didn't need.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.760]   So, how did this happen?
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:35.040]   It just struck me that I was just living a pretty unintentional life.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.760]   I never would have said my goal was to own a whole bunch of stuff, but that's how I was
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.040]   living and that's what I was thinking about and that's what I was doing.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:48.160]   And so, I started owning less stuff and seeing how that freed me up to focus more on things
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.560]   that actually mattered.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:55.120]   And it occurred to me that possessions, that physical things aren't the only distraction
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.400]   that can slowly creep into our lives and things that very subtly begin to shape the way we
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.480]   live or become the things that motivate us rather than longer lasting pursuits.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:12.080]   And so, the book lists out eight distractions that keep people from things that matter.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:17.520]   And ultimately, I think that we get to the end of our lives and regret some of the decisions
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.520]   that we made.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.000]   How do we overcome that regret?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.240]   How do we get to the end of our lives feeling the most satisfied and the most fulfilled?
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.760]   And I think we do that by identifying what is most important and then by daily removing
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.560]   any distractions that keep us from it.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.640]   So, you highlight eight distractions.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:41.520]   I would highly recommend anyone listening go and read to dig into those eight distractions.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.780]   But could we kind of run through at a high level what they are so people can get a sense
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.920]   of ones that might resonate with them and kind of inspire them to want to go pick up
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.960]   the book and start with the chapter there?
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.680]   Let me give you the eight distractions that I cover in the book.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:59.140]   Each is a listing of the distraction and then how we begin to overcome them.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.120]   Not that there's a three-step approach to overcoming all these things.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.880]   These are lifelong pursuits in a lot of ways.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:17.060]   But the distractions are fear, past mistakes, happiness, money, possessions, accolades,
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.100]   leisure and tech.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.100]   Those are the eight.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.100]   Okay.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   Or trivial.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.060]   I like to say trivial more than tech, but same thing.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.780]   And is there one that's the most important one to think about or if you looked at them
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.980]   and said "God, I have a little bit of all of these I should tackle first as one to try
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.660]   to kind of overcome"?
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:40.740]   I think that probably we all have each of these to some degree or another.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:47.020]   I did a nationwide survey for the book and I would say the most heartbreaking response
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:54.260]   that we got back was 60% of people say that they are held back from the future they want
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:02.320]   because of past mistakes they've committed in their life and 56% of people say that they
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:10.060]   are held back from the future they want because of a past mistake committed against them.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.060]   It really shook me.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.040]   I was pretty emotional when I saw that and that's just the people who would recognize
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:22.340]   it and articulate it, but that is a lot of potential that is being bottled up because
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.340]   of a mistake.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:28.820]   60% of us would say it out loud that "I can't live the future I want because of something
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.180]   that I did in the past" or "something that was done to me in the past".
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.460]   That's always a big one that I think comes to mind.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.900]   Money is a huge one.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.660]   Over 80% of us think we'll be happier if we have more money and 77% of us say that our
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:48.420]   desire for money affects our decisions every single day and money has a role in our lives,
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:54.100]   but when the desire for money becomes the thing that dictates our decisions, this is
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.700]   when I think we get to the end and like "what did I waste my life for?
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:03.460]   I spent my whole life always needing more and more money all the time when in reality,
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:09.620]   I had enough to live the life that I needed and could have been living instead".
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.860]   We talk a lot about money on the show, so I'd love to dig in a little bit there and
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.780]   say I imagine a lot of people resonate with that.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.740]   My wife and I have this conversation all the time.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:23.180]   It's like "oh, you know, we got to get to this milestone or this milestone" and as we
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.700]   think about it, we reflect and say "well, maybe we don't".
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.900]   And it's easier to say "you know what, maybe money is not going to actually make us happier
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.380]   and maybe we don't need that milestone", but that doesn't always change how you feel in
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:40.400]   the moment of seeing something or wanting something or hearing your friends talk in
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.400]   a certain way.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:46.000]   So, how do you go to that next step of "I've acknowledged that maybe money isn't the end
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.140]   all most important thing to my happiness, but it still gives me angst or distracts me"?
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.340]   Ninety percent of Americans say that they have financial related stress.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:02.580]   This was probably the stat that really sent me down this road when I read that.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:08.100]   Ninety percent of us have financial related stress and I'm like "we're the wealthiest
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:14.380]   nation in the history of the world, like why are ninety percent of us stressed about money?
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:19.900]   It's not because we don't have food, it's not because we don't have shelter, it's not
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.940]   because we don't have clothing".
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.460]   Certainly some of us don't have those things, but not ninety percent of us.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:31.620]   And so, I started wondering like "why is it that we're constantly stressed about money?"
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:39.140]   and I've just come to the conclusion that it's because we keep expecting money to provide
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.140]   something that it's never going to provide.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:48.060]   If we think more money is going to make us happy or that we're finally going to feel
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.060]   secure with how much money we have, and we get this picture in our head of how much we
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:58.420]   need, how much we think people who make that money are happy or feel secure, and then we
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:08.180]   get there and we don't feel secure and we don't feel happier, then the thinking never
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:15.380]   becomes "hey, maybe I'm just not going to find security and happiness in money".
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:22.780]   Instead the thinking becomes "I just had the wrong number and actually I need this much
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:29.260]   money or I need to be making that much money and then I'll finally feel satisfied or secure
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   or happy".
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:36.700]   Eighty-seven percent of millionaires say that they are not wealthy.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.700]   And so, the reality is that we need to realize that we're not going to find those things
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.940]   in money.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:47.140]   Harvard did this just fascinating study, 100,000 people I think they did in this study
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.580]   and they were like trying to figure out finally does money bring happiness.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:57.820]   There's all these debates of oh, $50,000 a year or $75,000 a year or money never really
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.820]   brings happiness.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.460]   How do we solve this whole thing?
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:06.300]   And they came to the conclusion after interviewing 100,000 people that the thing that trips us
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.940]   up is when money becomes the priority in our lives.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:19.460]   Or more specifically, when we start sacrificing time for money or when we start sacrificing
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:24.180]   other things that are important to us for the sake of making more money, that this is
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.100]   when life satisfaction really begins to drop.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:34.300]   And so, coming to the conclusion that "hey, I have enough money coming in to support my
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:39.740]   needs or I don't have to spend my entire life constantly pursuing more and more and more,
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:45.340]   but I have enough to meet my needs and my life would be much better served investing
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:49.340]   my time into other things that actually matter".
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.140]   I'm not sure if that answered your question, but I got to say a lot of things that I like
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.140]   to say.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:58.540]   No, no, I think it's helpful and it sounds like it's really more a process of having
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.520]   a conversation whether it's with yourself, your partner, your family, but there's no
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:08.100]   magic bullet to stop wanting more money as much as there is a conversation you need to
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.100]   keep thinking about.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.220]   Yeah, although I could give you a bullet, give some money away.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:17.220]   Give away $100, give away $50, give away $10, whatever it is.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:21.220]   Give something away or give away a little bit more than you already do and do it every
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:29.300]   single week and find out if you still have food and you still have shelter and you still
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:38.300]   have clothing and you will and the greatest benefit of generosity I think to ourselves
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.460]   is that we realize that we already have enough.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.180]   Just give away five dollars a week and when you realize that you've given away five dollars
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:51.300]   a week every week for two months and you still have food and you still have shelter, then
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:58.380]   we realize "okay, not only do I have enough money coming in, but I have so much money
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:05.140]   that I can actually give some away to someone else who needs it" and I think this then begins
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:13.260]   to reframe not just how much money we need, but just the joy that comes from helping someone
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:19.100]   that's in need from finding a problem in the world that we want to solve and not just thinking
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.740]   about it but actually being a part of the solution even if it's just to a small degree.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:29.780]   I think this is how we begin to reshape this constant need for money all the time.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:35.100]   Okay, Joshua just challenged us to all start giving some money away to help overcome the
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.660]   distraction of money and find the joy that comes from helping someone in need or from
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:44.140]   finding a problem we want to solve in the world and being a part of the solution.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:49.380]   That kind of a challenge is exactly why I'm so happy to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:54.140]   Daffy is an amazing company that Amy and I use for all our giving and they're on a mission
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.700]   to help people be more generous more often.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.620]   They offer an account that makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:06.340]   You can make a one-time contribution or you can set a little aside each week or month
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.020]   and all of your contributions are tax-deductible.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.740]   Except you don't have to know exactly where you want to give the money right away.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:18.740]   In fact, you can make your tax-deductible contribution now and invest the money in stocks
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:24.540]   or even crypto so it can grow tax-free and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:30.020]   Then whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more than 1.5 million charities, schools,
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.460]   and faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:39.940]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving today.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:45.220]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give to the
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.740]   charity of your choice.

[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:16.740]   You talked a lot in the book about being generous and how generosity helps and how acts of service
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.420]   help towards focusing on things that matter.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:25.260]   Are there things other than giving that can kind of help focus less on yourself and more
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.260]   on others?
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.800]   Yeah, getting out and doing something, getting dirt under your fingernails, as what I say
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   in the book.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.500]   Stop just reading about problems in the world and give something to it or get out and do
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.020]   something concerning it.
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.920]   But you can even take it beyond this.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.900]   It's just a whole mindset, even going to work on any given day.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.780]   Like what is my goal for the day ahead of me?
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:54.940]   If my goal for the day ahead of me is I need to earn the raise or I need notice by the
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.420]   boss so that I can receive the praise or the accolades.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:03.860]   If every day at work is all about what can I get out of this, that's a completely different
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:11.720]   way to approach work than hey, how can I just bring benefit to the people around me?
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:18.540]   Like who can I help today, who could I serve today, who could I invest into today?
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.340]   Not because of something that I'm going to get out of it, but just because it makes the
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.820]   world a better place by giving or serving or helping.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.500]   It's just a very different way to approach life.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   I love it.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:35.180]   So, I want to get to the last distraction you had, which was around technology or I
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.500]   think you said earlier, trivial things.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:42.400]   Let's talk about that a little because I think technology and the internet and our phones
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.240]   have really become a distraction.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:49.960]   I did a whole episode with Nir Eyal, who wrote this book about becoming indistractable.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.200]   So we don't necessarily need to go down the "How do you notice in the moment that you're
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.800]   about to use your phone?" and maybe not do that so you can spend time with your family.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.580]   But how is technology preventing us from finding our purpose, from finding the things we care
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.520]   about or as you say, the things that matter?
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:11.480]   I like to use the word "the trivial" because we're here today because of technology.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:17.040]   Like the technology in and of itself isn't the distraction, I get to do what I do every
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.200]   single day because of technology.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:26.020]   Am I using technology to create good into the world or am I just being used by technology
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.200]   for whatever the platform or app is trying to do?
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.400]   I think that's what becomes the distraction.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.560]   So I think it's important to remember that this distraction of the trivial isn't necessarily
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.560]   new.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:44.200]   I can remember even reading from ancient Rome, the arguments of not going to the Colosseum
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.800]   because it was a waste of time from things that actually matter and things that are more
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   important.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:55.120]   And I'm sure we had the same conversation when television started or radio or even books
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.880]   probably to some extent.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.280]   Like there's always been that distraction of less important things, tyranny of the urgent
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.760]   I think as someone once called it.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:08.520]   Our tech is certainly much more available than it was ever before and certainly around
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.520]   us all the time.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.160]   The way we think about technology and trying to recognize I can use this for good or I
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:21.240]   can be used by it to separate creation from consumption online and start to notice, am
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:26.120]   I using this to serve my purpose or am I being used by it?
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.160]   You do mention the concept of taking a digital detox.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:34.160]   If you feel technology is coming on strong, are there things people should think about
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.360]   when that's relevant or when it might make sense and what is it?
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.760]   I recommend it for everybody.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:44.840]   I think everybody, certainly anyone who's around technology and feels like it's becoming
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.960]   a distraction in their life, to take some time away.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.120]   Take 30 days, take 29 days.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.360]   For me, I've done 40 days different times or a couple weeks.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.400]   Pretty much every year, I try to get away because it just helps us understand how much
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.640]   time we were wasting on some of that stuff and then when we return it back to our lives
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:10.520]   and re-engage it, we do it in a much more intentional way, like what did I really miss
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:16.200]   about being away from social media or what apps actually were helpful on my phone and
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.760]   which ones were just distractions.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.000]   I really think it's the way to reorient.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.720]   It's certainly I think a pretty important first step for people.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:30.600]   I'm all for take all the apps off your home screen or wrap a rubber band around your phone.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:36.000]   Like I'm all in for different hacks and stuff but really the work that we need to do is
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.240]   reorient entirely.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.080]   The summer I think is the best time that you can do that, unless you live in Phoenix like
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.240]   I do everywhere else, it's pretty nice.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   Take a month and don't watch any television for a month, don't use your phone except for
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.960]   anything but phone and text and your email when you're at work and do it for a month.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.440]   See how it makes you feel and what you notice and what you missed and what was actually
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.040]   essential and what wasn't.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.040]   Wow.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.840]   For someone who kind of lives multiple jobs on the internet, it seems impossible but I
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.520]   sometimes commit to on the spot to things.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:11.440]   I committed to a month of cold showers in an interview, I am not going to commit.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.520]   There you go, there you go.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:20.320]   So one thing before we wrap, I try to ask everyone for wherever they are in the world
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:24.600]   or a city they know well to give everyone some recommendations, maybe for their summer
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:30.120]   travels if they end up in that place for where you think they should get a bite to eat or
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:35.720]   have dinner, meet a friend for a drink or a coffee and something they should do.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.120]   You can pick any city you want and I'd love to hear those three things.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.200]   Sure, I forget the three things because the whole time I was thinking we probably shouldn't
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:48.080]   come to Phoenix in the summer but if you're in Phoenix, which you should totally come
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.760]   to but maybe just not in June, July or August.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.360]   There's a little Mexican place called Barrio Cafe and I would send people there.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.840]   It's a great little Mexican place, probably going to be a long line to get a seat at the
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.800]   table but it's well worth it.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:06.200]   Barrio Cafe, you got to go hiking when you're in Phoenix, hike up Camelback Mountain.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.520]   There's two routes up Camelback Mountain, there's a really strenuous one that literally
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:15.400]   has you climbing up boulders and then there's a much more peaceful one but that's the hike
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.280]   to do if you're going to be in Phoenix.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   That's great.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:23.440]   I will put that on the list and before we wrap, we've talked about the book a few times,
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.440]   Things That Matter.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.960]   I definitely think people listening should check it out.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:31.280]   Where can people stay on top of everything you're up to online and get in touch?
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.120]   Yes, Things That Matter, overcoming distraction to pursue a more meaningful life.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.320]   You can find it everywhere.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:40.720]   My home base is becomingminimalist.com.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.760]   Anything and everything I do runs through there.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:47.720]   I should be on a speaking tour through what I'm calling the Midwest from Omaha and Chicago,
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:53.760]   Nashville, Louisville, Atlanta, Birmingham, New Orleans, all the way over to Austin.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.320]   So I'll be doing that this summer so people can come join me in July.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.320]   Sounds great.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.320]   Wonderful.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.320]   Thanks for having me.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.280]   This has been great.
