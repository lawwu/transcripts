[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   - Where do you put Magnus Carlsen,
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.220]   the current world champion in the list of all time greats?
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.240]   In terms of style, moments of brilliance, consistency?
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.320]   - It's a tricky question.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.920]   You know, the moment you start ranking--
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.920]   - Yeah, you lose something?
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.200]   - It's the, I think it's not fair
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.200]   because it's the, any new generation knows much more
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.460]   about the game than the previous one.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.960]   So when people say, oh, Gary was the greatest,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.020]   Fisher was the greatest, Magnus was the greatest,
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.700]   it disregard the fact that the great players of the past,
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.140]   whether Lasky or Capaplanca, Lokian,
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.260]   I mean, they knew so little about chess by today's standards.
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.940]   I mean, do they, just any kid, you know,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.440]   that spent few years, you know,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.980]   with his or her chess computer
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.460]   and knows much more about the game,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.300]   simply just because you have access to this information.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.820]   And it has been discovered generation after generation.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.220]   We added more and more knowledge to the game of chess.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.700]   It's about the gap between the world champion
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.080]   and the rest of the field.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.580]   So it's the, now, if you look at the gap,
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.640]   then probably Fisher, you know, could be on top,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.140]   but very short period of time.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.300]   Then you should also add a time factor.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.620]   I was on top, not as big as Fisher, but much longer.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.780]   So, and also, unlike Fisher,
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.100]   I succeeded in beating next generation.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.260]   - Here's the question.
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.100]   - Yeah.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.140]   - Let's see if you still got the fire,
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.300]   speaking of the next generation,
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.060]   because you did succeed beating the next generation.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.980]   - Next, it's close.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.260]   Okay, Anand, short Anand, the sheer of,
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.820]   Kramnik is already 12 years younger.
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.620]   So that's a neck, that's, but still yet,
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.340]   I competed with them and I just, I beat most of them.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.580]   And I was still dominant when I left at age 41.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.180]   So back to Magnus.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.620]   Magnus, I mean, consistency is phenomenal.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.980]   The reason Magnus is on top and it's,
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.980]   seems unbeatable today,
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.060]   Magnus is a lethal combination of Fisher and Karpov,
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.260]   which is very, it's very unusual
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.220]   because Fisher's style was very dynamic,
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.100]   just fighting to the last point,
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.460]   I mean, just using every resource available.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.660]   Karpov was very different.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.020]   It's just, he had an unparalleled ability
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.940]   to use the, every piece with a maximum effect,
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.380]   just its minimal resources always produce maximum effect.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.500]   So now imagine that you merge these two styles.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   So it's like, it's squeezing every stone for a drop of water,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.420]   but doing it just for 50, 60, 70, 80 moves.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.620]   I mean, Magnus could go on as long as Fisher
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.300]   with all his passion and energy,
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.820]   and at the same time being as meticulous
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.820]   and deadly as Karpov by just using every little advantage.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.940]   So, and he has good, you know, very good health.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.780]   It's important.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.820]   I mean, physical conditions are, by the way, very important.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.100]   So a lot of people don't recognize it.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.300]   There are latest studies shows that chess players
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   burn thousands of calories during the game.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.860]   So that puts him on the top of this field
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.340]   of the world champions.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.820]   But again, it's the discussion that is,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.060]   I saw recently in internet,
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.100]   whether Garry Kasparov of his peak, let's say late eighties
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.980]   could beat Magnus Carlsen today.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.940]   I mean, it's totally irrelevant
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.260]   because Garry Kasparov in 1989, okay,
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.100]   has played great chess, but still I knew very little
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.500]   about chess compared to Magnus Carlsen in 2019,
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.220]   who by the way, learned from me as well.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.820]   So that's why, yeah.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.380]   I'm extremely cautious in making any judgment
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.940]   that involves, you know, time gaps.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.100]   You ask, you know, soccer fans.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.300]   So who is your favorite, Pele, Maradona or Messi?
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.300]   Yeah. Who's your favorite?
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.140]   Messi.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.980]   Messi.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.980]   Why?
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.820]   Because-
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.780]   Maybe Maradona, maybe.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300]   No, because you're younger, but that's simple.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.980]   Your instinctive answer is correct
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.740]   because you didn't see Maradona in action.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.940]   I saw all of them in action, so that's why.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.460]   But since, you know, when I was, you know,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.060]   just following it, you know, just it's Pele and Maradona,
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.940]   they were just, you know, they were big stars.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.500]   And it's Messi's already just,
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.060]   I was gradually losing interest in just other things.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.460]   So I remember Pele in 1970, the final match Brazil-Italy.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.980]   So that's the first World Cup soccer I watched.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.540]   So that's the, and actually my answer when I just,
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.620]   when I just, you know,
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.740]   because I was asked this question as well.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.060]   So I say that it's just,
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.860]   while it's impossible to make a choice,
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.700]   I would still probably go with Maradona for a simple reason.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.180]   The Brazilian team in 1970 could have won without Pele.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.460]   It was absolutely great.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.140]   Still could have won, maybe, but it is,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.940]   the Argentinian team in 1986 without Maradona
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.780]   would not be in the final.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.620]   That's right.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.660]   And Messi, he still hasn't won a title.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.500]   That's, that's-
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.940]   - Could argue for that for an hour,
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.060]   but you could say, if you ask Maradona,
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.260]   if you look in his eyes,
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.860]   especially let's say Garry Kasparov in 1989,
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.540]   he would have said,
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.700]   "I was sure as hell would beat Magnus Carlsen."
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.540]   - Yeah, just simply because-
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.820]   - The confidence, the fire.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.060]   - Simply because, simply because, again,
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.420]   it's just they saw me in action.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.220]   So this, again, it's the age factor that's important.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.980]   Therefore, with the passion and energy
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.020]   and being equipped with all modern ideas.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.220]   But again, then you make a very just important assumption
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.020]   that you could empower Garry Kasparov in '89
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.900]   with all ideas that have been accumulated over 30 years.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.020]   That would not be Garry Kasparov.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.620]   That would be someone else.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.620]   Because again, I belong to 1989.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.260]   I was way ahead of the field.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.100]   And I beat Karpov several times
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.500]   in the world championship matches.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.700]   And I crossed 2,800, which, by the way,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.780]   if you look at the, in rating,
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.780]   which is just, even today,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.980]   so this is the rating that I retired.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.420]   So it's still, it's just, it's a top two, two, three.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.140]   So that's, it's Karwana and Deag.
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.860]   It's about the same rating now.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.700]   And I crossed 2,800 in 1990.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.300]   Well, just you look at the inflation.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.740]   When I crossed 2,800 in 1990,
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.060]   there was only one player in 2,700 category,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.060]   Anatoly Karpov.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.580]   Now we had more than 50.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.020]   So just, when you see this,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.700]   so if you add inflation, so I think my 2,851,
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.860]   it could probably, could be more valuable
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.540]   as Magnus 2882, which was his highest rating.
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.820]   But anyway, again, too many hypotheticals.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:45.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
