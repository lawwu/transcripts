[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Hello everyone, this is Tony again, and before we dive into today's episode, I'd like to
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.240]   ask you for a favor.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.160]   With this podcast, we want to serve you better in 2020 and beyond, and to serve you better
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.120]   means we need to know you better.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.520]   And to this end, we put together a brief survey.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.160]   It takes just a few minutes to fill out, and if you're willing to help us out, go online
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.920]   to DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.520]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.600]   And I'll mention that address again at the end of today's episode, which starts right
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.880]   now.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.200]   Was the cross overkill for sin?
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.360]   It's a question from a listener named Lisa.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.320]   "Dear Pastor John, thank you for your diligence in taking the time to help people all over
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.840]   the world work through difficult questions.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.400]   I have one.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.480]   Why do we need a Savior in the first place?
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.100]   I consider myself to be a good person, and when I look around at most people, I would
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.960]   say the same about them.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.160]   I know I'm not perfect, and I cannot hold God's law perfectly, but I don't consider
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.120]   my thoughts and actions to be so terrible that they need to be punished by death.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.960]   Should I really need to die because I disobeyed my parents as a child or told a lie?
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.120]   I have a difficult time seeing myself and those close to me as being wicked and utterly
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.240]   depraved.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.400]   There is certainly great evil in the world, such as war, rape, murder, racism, oppression,
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.400]   etc.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.080]   But the majority of the world doesn't need God to see these things as evil or to make
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.320]   a positive change.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.640]   I certainly don't see how someone innocent, dying a horrible death, can somehow make my
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.060]   wrongs right in the sight of God.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.280]   Can you help me make sense of this seemingly twisted justice and come to understand why
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.920]   I need Jesus?"
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   I think Lisa speaks for millions of people who quietly don't feel comfortable, to put
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.480]   it mildly, don't feel comfortable with hell or with the cross of Christ.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.360]   And I would state the problem like this.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:14.860]   Where God is small and man is big, hell will be abhorrent, indeed absurd, and the cross
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.700]   will be foolishness.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.440]   So where God is small and man is big, hell will be abhorrent and the cross will be foolishness.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.420]   The most telling thing about Lisa's question is that her conception of evil can never be
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.620]   big enough to make sense of hell or the cross of Christ, because she defines evil only in
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.640]   relation to what harms man, not what demeans God.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.880]   She says, for example, "I have a difficult time seeing myself as being wicked and utterly
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.860]   depraved," and then she defines evil like this.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:04.460]   There is great evil in the world, such as war, rape, murder, racism, oppression, but
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.180]   the majority of the world doesn't need God to see these things as evil or make a change.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.440]   So what are the great evils in the world, according to Lisa?
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.380]   And the answer is war, rape, murder, racism, oppression.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.580]   Now all of these are ways that man harms man.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.800]   You don't even need God in the picture in order to call those evil.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:40.260]   Lisa doesn't seem to have a category for evil understood as the dishonoring, demeaning,
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.300]   disparaging, insulting of God, as infinitely worthy of honor.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.220]   It doesn't come into her picture.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.340]   So let's do a thought experiment.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.620]   Suppose there is no God, and Lisa is a super successful Adolf Hitler.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.420]   Not saying she leans that way at all, just an experiment.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.000]   Super successful Adolf Hitler.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.880]   She is able not only to kill all the Jews in the world, but all the other non-Aryans.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.300]   Everybody in Africa, she kills.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.320]   Everybody in China, she kills.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.280]   Everybody in India, she kills.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.660]   Everybody in South America, she kills.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.100]   So she succeeds in orchestrating the murder of about 7 billion people, and the question
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.820]   is would she deserve eternal punishment in hell?
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.700]   And my answer is no, she wouldn't, for two reasons.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.420]   First, if there's no God and we are simply complex chemical and material animals, then
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.540]   there's no such thing as right and wrong anyway, or desert, or merit, blameworthiness, just
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.700]   different chemical reactions.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.500]   But second, and more importantly for my point, she wouldn't deserve an infinitely long punishment
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:11.080]   because 7 billion murders are still finite, and a finite number of finite crimes doesn't
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.620]   deserve an infinite punishment.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.180]   In other words, when God is left out, there's no way to have an infinite crime deserving
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.740]   of an infinite punishment like hell or the cross.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.780]   They would simply be unjust.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.680]   But this is why God has spoken to us in the Bible.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.060]   We will never understand the depth of our sinfulness without God's telling us what
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.140]   the problem is, which he has very clearly.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.960]   Lisa and I would never come up with this truth on our own.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.200]   We must learn it from the Bible.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:00.760]   And what God has said is this, "The essence of evil, what makes evil evil, is not harm
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.600]   done to man, but indignities done to God."
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:13.920]   Harm to man is horrible, but it is meant to be a vivid parable of the outrage of failing
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.680]   to honor God, failing to glorify God, failing to thank God as God.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:31.440]   So ask this question, if God is of infinite value, infinite beauty, infinite greatness,
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:39.560]   with all of his perfections uniting in an infinitely satisfying panorama of personal
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.800]   beauty and glory, then of what is he worthy from the human soul?
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   That's the key question.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.400]   And Jesus answers, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.280]   soul and all your mind."
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.160]   And Paul answered, "Whatever you do, whether you eat or whether you drink, not one minute
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.000]   of your life, but do it to the glory of God."
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.240]   And in another place, he said that he aims that Christ be magnified in his body, whether
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   by life or by death.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.040]   Over and over again in the Bible, it's made plain that God created the world so that his
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:29.160]   infinitely valuable glory would be manifest in creation by the worshipful enjoyment of
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.920]   his creation.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:38.840]   The essence of virtue, the essence of virtue, therefore, is to love and desire and prefer
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:47.240]   and treasure and enjoy and thus honor God above all things in this world.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:55.040]   And the essence of evil, essence of evil is loving and preferring and desiring and treasuring
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.880]   and enjoying anything above God.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.400]   It's treason.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   And since God is of infinite worth and beauty and greatness and honor, infinite, the failure
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:15.960]   to love and treasure and enjoy him above all things is an infinite outrage worthy of infinite
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.720]   punishment.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.480]   This will make no sense where God is small and man is big.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:29.400]   It will only make sense where people see God as great as he really is and see man, see
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:37.880]   ourselves and our outrageous God-belittling self-centeredness for what they are.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.360]   Paul said both Jews and Greeks are under sin.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.800]   It is written, "None is righteous, no, not one."
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.600]   And then he explained what this failure is, this sin.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.240]   He says in verse 23 of Romans 3, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:02.440]   And you see how he moves immediately from the concept of sin to failing to embrace the
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.280]   glory of God as our supreme treasure.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.960]   And the reason I put it like that, failure to embrace the glory of God as our supreme
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   treasure, the reason I put it like that is because just earlier back in chapter 1, verses
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:21.860]   22 and 23, Paul describes the human race as claiming to be wise, they became fools and
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.960]   exchanged the glory of God for images.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.560]   There's the essence of evil.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.920]   The outrage of the human race is not humans killing humans.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.300]   That's not the outrage of the human race, but humans exchanging the glory of the immortal
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.980]   God for anything less.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.420]   That's who we are.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:52.340]   We are outrageous, treasonous, God-belittling, self-exalting rebels against God.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.960]   And we are this way even in our so-called moral efforts to do good to other people while
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:07.240]   giving almost zero attention, zero affection, zero admiration to God and taking no delight
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.700]   in his glory.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:19.840]   God gave a glimpse of his rage toward such evil in these words from Jeremiah 2, 12 to
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.920]   13, "Be appalled, O heavens," this is God talking, "Be appalled, O heavens, at this.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.320]   Be shocked, be utterly desolate, declares the Lord, for my people have committed two
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.380]   evils.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.760]   They have forsaken me."
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.160]   This is great evil.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:44.120]   "My people have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out for themselves
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.440]   cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water."
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:56.440]   The great shock, the great appalling reality in the world is that humans have turned from
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:03.120]   God as the all-satisfying fountain of life and joy and tried to find it, not in God,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   but in what he made.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.760]   It is high treason and worthy of eternal punishment.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.680]   That, Lisa, that, Lisa, is why we need a Savior.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:26.320]   And I tremble with thankfulness that God in mercy sent his infinitely worthy Son to do
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.540]   what no mere man could ever do.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:38.600]   Only a God-man can bear an infinite punishment for all who embrace him for the glorious one
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.000]   that he really is.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Amen.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.320]   The great shock, the most wicked evil there is, the root behind all other evils, and the
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:53.760]   reason we wrong and harm one another is because we have turned away from God as our all-satisfying
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.480]   fountain of life and joy.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   That is so sobering.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.440]   Thank you for that word, Pastor John, and thank you for the very honest question, Lisa.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.540]   I appreciate you articulating that for yourself and for the many, many people that you represent.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.780]   This topic also raises that important question, "Is evil only evil when it harms other people?"
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.000]   That's a closely connected question, and that's coming up on the podcast in about a week on
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.100]   January 22nd, I believe.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.240]   Be watching for that one on the podcast.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.400]   Is evil only evil when it harms others?
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.320]   A question that dovetails into this one from Lisa.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.720]   But next up, "How should we best parent non-Christian teenagers?
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.640]   Should church attendance be required for an unbelieving teen who doesn't want to go?"
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.000]   It's a big question on the minds of a lot of parents.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.360]   It's up next on Wednesday.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.080]   Until then, if you want to help us out, fill out our online survey.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.760]   Several of you already had, and I thank you for doing that.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.520]   If you want to join them, go to DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   Thank you.
