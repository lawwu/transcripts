[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   We apologize for the poor quality during the following recording of a sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.440]   This was due to a fault in the original recording process and is beyond repair.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.800]   However, we have digitally reprocessed the audio
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.400]   and we hope that you'll find the message helpful and enjoyable.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.600]   I want to call your attention this evening to the chapter that has been read to us,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.480]   namely the second chapter in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.920]   And I say deliberately that I want to call attention to the whole chapter
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160]   rather than to one particular verse or text.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.240]   But if there are those amongst you who like one verse in particular,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.520]   we might as well select the tenth verse.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   "But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.400]   for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.200]   But I really do want to consider the whole chapter with you because,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.600]   as I'm hoping to show you, the apostle deals with one theme and one only in this chapter.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.200]   He keeps on repeating it in every single verse.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.560]   And it is because I'm anxious to direct your attention to this particular theme
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.720]   that I'm calling attention to the whole chapter tonight.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.840]   Now, this is a very modern theme.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.640]   That's the marvelous thing about the scripture.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.240]   It's always up to date, always contemporary.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.320]   And I want to show you this evening that here the great apostle deals
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.240]   with what in many senses is the most urgent problem and question
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.000]   confronting the Christian church at this moment.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.360]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.280]   I think there are some three things that are characteristic of the modern men
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.320]   which must amaze us and come as a problem to us.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.760]   They are these.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.800]   The first is that amidst all his perplexities and problems,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.920]   and they are truly stupendous and alarming,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.160]   wars and possibilities of wars and so on,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   and the whole state of society in every country throughout the world,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.920]   the amazing thing is that modern men,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.600]   faced with such problems and baffled by them,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.720]   refuses to consider the only solution to them,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.520]   namely the one that is to be found in this book.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.160]   He'll listen to statesmen.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.440]   He'll listen to philosophers.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.880]   He'll listen to poets.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.080]   He'll listen to anybody.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.320]   But he will not listen to the message of this book,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.960]   which alone can deal with his problems.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.720]   That's one extraordinary thing about the modern men.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.040]   The second thing which is extraordinary about him is this,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.240]   that he is obviously a hero worshiper.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.160]   Modern men is prepared to stand for hours to get just a passing glimpse of a film star.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.960]   They'll stand in the rain in order to do so.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.880]   They're always ready to turn men into heroes.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.960]   We've had examples of that recently.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.880]   I'm not here to criticize that.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.560]   There's nothing wrong in hero worship.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.960]   But what is astonishing is this,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.040]   that the modern men who is so interested in remarkable and unique personalities
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.720]   has such little interest in the greatest figure,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.600]   the greatest personality that this world has ever known,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.320]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.240]   Isn't it strange?
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.560]   And the third thing which characterizes the modern men,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.040]   and the three things, of course, belong together,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.540]   is this.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.360]   Modern men is interested in great events,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.640]   in a remarkable, unique happening.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.840]   This is one of his great characteristics.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.120]   And yet, while that is true of him,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.840]   it is equally true to say of him,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.600]   that when he looks at or is confronted by
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.880]   the greatest and the most unique event that has ever happened or ever can happen,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.920]   namely the death of the Son of God on the cross on Calvary's hill,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.720]   he passes it by unconcerned and with contempt and with derision.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.440]   Now this is, I think, something which is really remarkable.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.120]   This obvious contradiction in modern men.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.280]   He contradicts himself at his most vital points.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.240]   And the great question for us is to discover why this is true of him.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.200]   And it is because that very problem is dealt with in this chapter
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.280]   that I'm calling your attention to it.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.320]   Why does modern men not consider this message,
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.840]   the message of the gospel, and believe it and accept it and apply it?
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.120]   The answer, I think, quite simply is this.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.680]   It is because his whole approach to this gospel is entirely and completely wrong.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.480]   And because his very initial approach is wrong,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.360]   obviously he's going to be wrong with respect to it in every single manner and every single detail.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.480]   Now I say the great apostle deals with that very subject here.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.080]   Those of you who are familiar with this epistle, this first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.960]   will remember that very quickly and very soon in this epistle,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.640]   the apostle takes up this matter.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.680]   One of the first reasons he had for writing to the church at Corinth
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.360]   was that, to his astonishment and amazement,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.760]   they were tending to go back to and to revert to an old manner and style of thinking.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.880]   He'd been there and had preached the gospel.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.160]   They believed it and the church had been established and founded.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.680]   But he hears that so many of them now are reverting to an old way of thinking.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.400]   They were going back to human philosophy, human wisdom.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.000]   So he takes up this matter immediately in the first chapter in verse 17.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.560]   Christ Jesus sent me, not to baptize, but to preach the gospel.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.520]   Then, not with wisdom of words,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.760]   lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.480]   And from there, really, until the end of the fourth chapter,
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.200]   he simply deals with this one great question.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.120]   He's astonished at them.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.960]   He points out to them that if they persist in this way,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.320]   they're going to make everything that he preached to them of none effect.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.720]   The cross will be of none effect.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.640]   Everything will be of none effect.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.920]   They don't realize this.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.280]   But the devil had come in in a very subtle way.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.600]   And he was undermining the whole Christian position
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.920]   by getting these people once more to go back to that old style of thinking.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.440]   So, what we have here in this great passage,
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.520]   and it's because it's summed up so perfectly in the second chapter
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.440]   that I'm dealing with this in particular,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.960]   we have the apostle putting before us the essential contrast
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.520]   between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of men,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.040]   the wisdom of this present world.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.400]   And my suggestion is that so many today
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.560]   not only do not believe this gospel,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.720]   but reject it even without considering it
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.680]   for the simple reason that they approach it
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.800]   in terms of human earthly wisdom
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.160]   and fail to see at the very beginning
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.720]   that it doesn't belong to that realm at all,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.360]   but that it is altogether and entirely different.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.600]   Now, this is such a vital matter that I don't apologize
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.000]   for taking you through it in detail.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.840]   Let's start with human wisdom,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.920]   the wisdom of men,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.040]   the wisdom of this world as the apostle describes it.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.520]   For this is the thing, of course,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.920]   that is controlling the thinking of people today.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.840]   And alas, it is not only controlling the thinking
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.520]   of those who are outside the church,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.880]   it is controlling the thinking, it seems to me,
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.920]   of the vast majority who are inside the church.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.600]   And here, I believe, is the great watershed
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.280]   that is going to divide Christian people in this century.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.760]   We are on one or the other side of this great watershed.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   We either believe in God's wisdom revelation
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.000]   or else we are submitting to the wisdom
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.920]   and to the philosophy of men.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.960]   Now, let's look at this human philosophy.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.600]   You're all familiar with it.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.600]   Let's put it in this form.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.240]   It tends at the moment to take this scientific form.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.280]   Human wisdom is always the same,
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.440]   but from age to age, it assumes different forms.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.040]   And the favorite form at the present time
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.880]   is, of course, the scientific one.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.680]   This is what's controlling people's thinking.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.800]   People look to the scientists.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.720]   He's become the new authority.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.240]   Whatever the scientist says,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.320]   people are prepared to listen to.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.960]   Whatever a scientist may say on any subject,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.760]   the scientist is the man of all knowledge,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.440]   the man of understanding.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.760]   So the great characteristic of this age
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.960]   is that it's governed by a scientific outlook.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.360]   And I want to show you that it is because of that,
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.520]   that they reject this gospel
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.760]   and so deny themselves the results of this great salvation.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.640]   Now, what are the characteristics of this scientific outlook?
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   This scientific mode of approach to all problems?
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.080]   Well, I needn't keep you with this.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.440]   We've been told so much about it on the radio,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.200]   on the television, and in the books
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.800]   that we're all familiar with it.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.920]   The scientific outlook is an outlook
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.000]   which starts with man and his ability.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.760]   It's all based on that, obviously.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.400]   It believes that man's got the power
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   and the capacity to understand everything.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   And to conquer his environment.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.000]   Now, how does this happen?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.840]   Well, this is, in its essence,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.440]   the scientific method, isn't it?
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.760]   You start by observation.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.400]   This is the scientific approach,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.600]   the scientific method.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.400]   You look, you observe.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.000]   You look at the universe around you.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.760]   Then, having made your observations,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.200]   you collect your facts
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.240]   and you put them together and you collate them.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.280]   Then you look at them and examine them.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.760]   And you discover that there are certain rules
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.120]   or certain laws evidently in operation.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.680]   For instance, you see that every year
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.280]   you have spring, summer, autumn, winter,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.080]   with a strange regularity.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.040]   The scientist observes this, he notes it,
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.120]   and he discovers that there is a law here
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.360]   that produces this cycle.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   One thing leads to another,
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.600]   cause and effect, and so on.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.000]   So, having started with observation,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.360]   and I should have added,
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.840]   he also listens, he uses his ears,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.360]   and he hears the sounds and he collects them
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.600]   and he coordinates them and collates them
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.720]   in the same way,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.200]   and proceeds to analyze them in the same manner.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.840]   Very well.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.320]   Having done this, he arrives at a number of rules
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.120]   and of laws.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   They are commonly called the laws of nature.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.840]   But he doesn't stop at that.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.920]   He now begins to reason on what he's discovered.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.640]   And he says to himself,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.960]   "If this cause leads to that effect,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.000]   surely that in turn might become a cause
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.680]   which will lead to another effect."
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.360]   And so he puts up his hypothesis,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.640]   and says, "I'll try to see what happens
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.880]   when I turn this into a cause.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.480]   Will it produce that effect?"
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.880]   So he makes an experiment.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.680]   This is the essence of the scientific method,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.080]   isn't it?
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   You arrive, you see facts,
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.480]   and then on that you build up a theory.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.280]   And then you test your theory.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.880]   You make an experiment, trial and error.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.160]   Take, for instance,
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.000]   these amazing things that have been done
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.880]   by your great country in these past years.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.640]   This thing which has just happened
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.960]   of putting men onto the surface of the moon.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.840]   How did it happen?
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.360]   Well, you see, it just happened like this.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.280]   A man sent off a rocket and it went up so high.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.520]   He then said, "Now, if I put another rocket
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.800]   into that first one,
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.240]   and arrange that it should go off
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.360]   where the first one stops,
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.800]   it'll go up and to there.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.240]   Then if I put another one in that,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.200]   it'll go up there."
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.800]   And on and on you go
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.440]   until you eventually lend a man on the moon.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.400]   Of course, it doesn't always succeed the first time.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.720]   But this is the method,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.000]   trial and error,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.040]   experimentation,
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.720]   verification,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.360]   or falsification of your theories.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.400]   And on and on you go with this method.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.080]   And at last,
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.800]   you make your grand discovery
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.560]   and you shout out your eureka.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.000]   That is, I think you'll all agree with me,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.240]   the essence of the scientific method.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.560]   And the things that we emphasize about it are these.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.920]   It is based on human ability,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.160]   man's brain,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.680]   man's understanding,
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.800]   man's power to experiment.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.480]   It's based entirely on man's capacity.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.480]   And it rarely believes
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.240]   that there is virtually nothing
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.160]   that is impossible to men.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.440]   Some foolish men,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.720]   I'm sorry to say in England,
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   and men holding high positions
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.560]   even in the University of Cambridge,
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.680]   haven't hesitated to say
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.720]   that man is soon going to become a creator
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.880]   and God is no longer necessary and so on.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.760]   But there it is.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   It's based on human ability
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.280]   and experimentation
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.440]   and research and development.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.480]   And at last,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.560]   you arrive at the desired result.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.280]   Now that is the essence
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.280]   of the scientific method.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.560]   And the modern man is controlled
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.520]   by that outlook.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.480]   That determines his attitude
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.920]   towards everything.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.520]   And that is why he rejects this gospel.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.360]   For here, you see,
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.560]   we have something
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.160]   which I want to show you now
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.400]   is the exact opposite
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   of what I've just been describing to you.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   Let's note it together.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.440]   I make no apology
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.560]   for taking you through
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.840]   every single verse
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.880]   in this second chapter
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.840]   of Paul's first epistle
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.280]   to the Corinthians again.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.780]   Listen.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.680]   "And I, brethren,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.360]   when I came to you,
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.400]   came not with excellency
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.760]   of speech or of wisdom."
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.840]   Well, why did he ever go to them?
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.960]   Did he go to them to join
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   in the research team
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.120]   that was investigating truth
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.880]   or trying to discover reality?
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.600]   Is he a seeker and a searcher
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.240]   after the truth?
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.840]   No, no, here's his word
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.200]   declaring unto you.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.520]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.760]   It's not seeking.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.880]   It's declaring.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.560]   It's pronouncing
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.760]   the testimony of God.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.560]   And notice at once
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.600]   that the subject matter
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.960]   is entirely different.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.680]   I'll show you that
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.200]   in greater detail in a moment.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.000]   And then he goes on
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.800]   in the second verse.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.880]   "For I determined
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.360]   not to know anything among you."
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.200]   He knew many things.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   He was a learned.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.680]   He was an erudite man,
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.720]   this apostle.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.160]   He deliberately decided
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.200]   and determined
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.720]   not to know anything among them
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.480]   save Jesus Christ
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   and him crucified.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.520]   "And I was with you," he says,
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.280]   "in weakness
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.680]   and in fear
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.920]   and in much trembling."
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.680]   You won't get very far
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.560]   in the modern world
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.600]   if that's your condition.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.240]   Weakness, fear,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.600]   much trembling.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.480]   If you want to get on,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.920]   you must be self-confident
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.640]   and assured.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.720]   You must believe in yourself
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.920]   and in your powers.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.680]   You must express yourself.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.960]   Here's the exact opposite.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.440]   Weakness, fear,
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.200]   much trembling.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.920]   "And my speech and my preaching,"
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.040]   watch the negatives,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.680]   "was not
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.080]   with enticing words
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.000]   of man's wisdom."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.520]   It isn't man's wisdom.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.320]   What is it then?
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.080]   Oh, it's in demonstration
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.840]   of the spirit and of power.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.360]   Why?
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.320]   That your faith
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.480]   should not stand
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.920]   in the wisdom of men
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.720]   but in the power of God.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.480]   It's a contrast.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.760]   It's an antithesis
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.960]   in every single verse.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.520]   It's not this human wisdom.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.600]   It's the power of God.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.920]   And then in verse 6,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.800]   he appears at first
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.000]   to be contradicting himself
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.960]   when he says,
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   "Howbeit we speak wisdom
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.240]   among them that are perfect."
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.640]   But then, lest you think
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.920]   he is contradicting himself,
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.280]   he hastens to add,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.520]   "Yet not the wisdom of this world
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.240]   nor of the princes of this world
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.200]   that come to naught
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.400]   but the contrast,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.680]   absolute contrast.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.440]   We speak the wisdom of God
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.120]   in a mystery.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.960]   Even the hidden wisdom
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.760]   which God ordained
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.800]   before the world
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.600]   unto our glory.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.080]   It's altogether different.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.840]   And then to make it
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   absolutely certain
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.040]   that everybody's grasped this,
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.760]   he says,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.360]   "Which none of the princes
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.480]   of this world knew."
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.960]   And remember when he says princes,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.880]   he's not thinking so much
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.120]   of members of royal houses
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.480]   or royal families.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.240]   He means by the princes,
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.120]   the great men,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.800]   the leaders in every realm
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.240]   and department of life.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.600]   The great philosophers,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.560]   the great thinkers,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.240]   the great religious leaders,
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:20.800]   all of them,
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.080]   these are the princes.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.800]   He says,
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.520]   "Which none of the princes
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.720]   of this world knew."
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.040]   Now the princes of this world
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.160]   are not to be despised.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.040]   They're able men.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.880]   And the princes of this world
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.920]   are very able
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.000]   at recognizing one another.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.680]   A great physicist
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.000]   recognizes another great physicist.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.040]   A great philosopher
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.880]   recognizes another philosopher.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.440]   A great scientist
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.320]   of any description
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.000]   recognizes a great scientist.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.440]   A great poet, a great poet,
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.000]   and so on.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.280]   The princes of this world
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.280]   recognize one another.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.160]   But the tragedy of the world
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:58.640]   is this,
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   that none of the princes
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.840]   of this world knew him.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.080]   For had they known him,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.160]   they would not have crucified
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.160]   the Lord of Glory.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.520]   Here is still the tragedy
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.320]   of the world.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.280]   These great men,
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.240]   these able men
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.120]   who seem to be able
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.560]   to do almost everything,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.920]   when they were confronted
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.840]   by the Son of God,
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.440]   they didn't recognize him.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.600]   They said, "Who is this fellow?"
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.600]   "Who is this carpenter?"
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.880]   "This nonsense
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.240]   about a redeeming death
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.960]   upon a cross."
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.640]   None of the princes
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.680]   of this world knew him.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.560]   And yet these people
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.520]   were going back
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.160]   to the wisdom
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.280]   of these princes.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.240]   They're doing exactly
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.280]   the same thing today.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.600]   And then he puts it
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.280]   in a most amazing statement,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.920]   as if he anticipated
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.600]   the modern scientific method.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.120]   But he says,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.160]   as it is written,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.440]   "I have not seen."
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.760]   Now I told you just now
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.520]   that the first step always
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.880]   in the scientific method
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.000]   is observation.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.160]   I was trained
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.040]   as a medical man,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.240]   and I'll never forget
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.920]   what we had drummed into us
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.040]   as medical students.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.000]   Our teachers used to tell us always,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.600]   "Now don't rush at a patient
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.120]   and begin to examine them.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.080]   Look at them first."
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.760]   Observation.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.160]   It's the first rule
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.520]   in the scientific approach.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.000]   But the apostle tells us here
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.800]   that it's no good.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.480]   "I have not seen."
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.680]   Man's very proud
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.960]   of his seeing, isn't he?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.720]   We're all proud
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.240]   of these giant telescopes
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.800]   that we've got
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.760]   in different countries
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.640]   at the present time.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.040]   They can penetrate so far.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.560]   We've got a marvelous telescope.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.680]   I believe it's actually bigger
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.120]   than any one you've got.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.640]   That's good for your humility.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.120]   In a place which is called
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.720]   Jodrell Bank in England.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.960]   And it can see right
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.880]   into these immense distances.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.520]   But you know, my friends,
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.480]   when you're concerned
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.600]   with this truth,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.480]   your Jodrell Banks are useless.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.240]   "Eye hath not seen,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.080]   and never can see."
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.920]   Not only the eye,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.600]   but the ear is equally useless.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.920]   "Eye hath not seen,
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.960]   nor ear heard."
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.240]   And even your poetic imagination
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.800]   is useless.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.240]   Neither have entered
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.360]   into the heart of men.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.600]   The things which God hath prepared
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.880]   for them that love him.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.200]   The thing is entirely different.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.800]   The thing you rely on
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.160]   in the realm of science
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.000]   is already ruled out of court here.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.640]   It's useless.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.480]   And then he puts it once and forever
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.160]   in this mighty statement.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.680]   "But God hath revealed them unto us."
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.960]   It isn't seeking and searching.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.160]   It isn't research.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.320]   It isn't trial and error.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.040]   It is revelation.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.640]   "But God hath revealed them unto us
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.840]   by his spirit.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.760]   For the spirit searches all things,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.840]   yea, the deep things of God."
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.520]   And then here's a great question
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.400]   for the modern men.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.200]   "What men knoweth the things of a man,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   save the spirit of men which is in him.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.280]   Even so the things of God knoweth no man,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.560]   but the spirit of God."
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.920]   What does that mean?
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.560]   It means this.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.520]   "What men knoweth the things of a man,
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.920]   save the spirit of men which is in him."
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.600]   How does a man recognize a man?
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   He does so because they've got
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.640]   the same spirit in them.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.760]   A dog can be a very intelligent animal.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.800]   But a dog never really knows
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.720]   and understands a man.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.120]   Why?
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.640]   Well, because he's a dog.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.320]   He has the spirit of a dog in him,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.360]   not the spirit of a man.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.600]   Before you can have true knowledge,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.160]   there must be a correspondence of spirit.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.120]   I can put this quite simply to you like this.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.160]   There are many great scientists in the world,
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.840]   but they get nothing out of poetry.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.840]   There are many great poets in the world,
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.440]   but they get nothing out of science.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.920]   Why?
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.960]   Well, you see,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.800]   if you haven't got the poetic instinct,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.120]   or if you haven't got the scientific mentality,
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.480]   you're not able to understand the realms.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.200]   There must be this correspondence of spirit.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.280]   "What men knoweth the things of a man,
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.280]   save the spirit of men that is in him.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.920]   Even so the things of God knoweth no man,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.360]   but the spirit of God."
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.360]   You see, this is the basic statement.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.720]   And yet this is what the modern world is incapable of seeing.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.080]   Man believes that he can arrive at any knowledge,
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.880]   every knowledge,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   but he can't, by definition.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.000]   As a dog can never really know a man,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.600]   so men can never know God in and of himself.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   The spirit of God is essential.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.400]   And then, to make it absolutely certain that we've all got it.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.000]   Now, we Christians have received
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.880]   not the spirit of the world.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.640]   That's no good.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.360]   But the spirit which is of God,
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.760]   in order that we might know the things
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.960]   that we arrive at as the result of research,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.240]   no, that are freely given to us of God.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.800]   You don't do anything about them.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.360]   You just receive them in your utter helplessness.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.520]   It's a complete indifference in every sentence,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.000]   in every verse from beginning to end.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.880]   And then he goes on,
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.800]   "Which things also we speak,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.440]   "not in the words which man's wisdom teaches,
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.200]   "but which the Holy Ghost teaches,
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.800]   "comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.680]   Isn't this the essential trouble in the Christian church tonight?
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.520]   That they're even handling theology in terms of philosophy.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.640]   They're going back to human wisdom.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.920]   And they use these great philosophic terms.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.000]   They're speaking in the words that man's wisdom teaches.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.200]   And it is a denial of the truth.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.600]   For this truth can only be expressed in the words
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.120]   which the Holy Ghost teaches,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.920]   comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.880]   Now, let me illustrate this to you again.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.000]   Imagine a man who's been trained in the classics
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   or who's a poet by nature,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.520]   going into a scientific laboratory
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.240]   or trying to understand the way
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.920]   in which they're able to put these men up onto the moon.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.600]   And these extraordinary scientific formulae.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.400]   The poor poet, it's all gibberish to him.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.000]   It's nonsense.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.920]   He doesn't understand it at all.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.720]   He doesn't understand the language of the terminology.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.080]   Or if you take your scientist, as I say,
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.880]   and put him amongst the classics
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.480]   or give him a great bit of poetry,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.640]   he may feel it's nonsense.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.480]   And music may mean nothing to him.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.120]   But this is the very confusion
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   that is characterizing our modern world.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.000]   Men do not realize that you've got to compare
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.560]   spiritual things with spiritual.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.920]   There is to every language or to every discipline
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.680]   its appropriate language.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.080]   The scientist speaks in his scientific terminology.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.720]   The poet speaks in his particular way.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   And these things cannot be missed.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.400]   What would you think of a scientist, I wonder?
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.240]   Oh, anxious to propose to a certain young lady
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.600]   that she should become his wife.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   Should send her just a list of scientific formulae.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.440]   The thing is ridiculous.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.080]   You don't make love in scientific jargon.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.880]   You do it in words that convey love
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.520]   and that can be understood by the object of your love.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.400]   But this is the whole essence of the modern confusion.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.840]   They won't take these spiritual things in spiritual terms.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.920]   They are handling them in scientific terms
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.200]   and philosophic terms in terms of men's wisdom.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.720]   But it's God's wisdom.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.880]   And this wisdom can only be spoken in the words
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.720]   which the Holy Ghost teaches,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.040]   comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.960]   But he says to make it abundantly clear,
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.480]   the natural men receiveth not the things
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.080]   of the spirit of God.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.800]   For they are foolishness unto him.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.680]   Neither can he know them.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.560]   There it is.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.840]   He cannot know them.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.440]   Doesn't matter who he is.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.160]   Why not?
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.480]   Because they are spiritually deserved.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.760]   The type of Christian I can never understand
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   is the Christian who is troubled and disturbed
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.960]   in his mind and spirit
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.040]   because he says all these great scientists are not Christians.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.080]   Some of them proclaim they're atheists.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.360]   And he's troubled about this.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.720]   That these great men with their great brains
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.400]   should not believe the Christian truth.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.880]   My dear friend, you shouldn't be surprised at this.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.160]   The natural men receiveth not the things
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.760]   of the spirit of God.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   They are foolishness unto him.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.440]   They were in the first century.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.760]   They are still so in the 20th century.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.680]   Doesn't matter how great a man he may be,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.440]   nor however great his brain,
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.080]   if he is lacking in the spirit of God,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.920]   he cannot understand them.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.400]   And they're of necessity foolish to him.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.880]   The modern scientist who denies the gospel
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.320]   is confirming the gospel.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.680]   But he that is spiritual,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.800]   this man who is born again of the spirit
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.000]   and has the spirit in him,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.080]   he judges or understands all things.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.440]   Yet he himself is judged of no man.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.760]   When a man becomes a Christian,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.680]   he becomes a problem to his friends.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.800]   They say, what's gone wrong with him?
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.080]   There's some change in him.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.960]   He's different.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   He's believing things he used to ridicule.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.280]   Of course, he's not judged of any man.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.320]   That's because he's now got spiritual understanding himself.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.440]   And then to close,
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.560]   for who has known the mind of the Lord?
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.480]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.080]   That he may instruct him.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.080]   And then one of the most astounding things
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.200]   the apostle ever wrote.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.600]   We, Christian people,
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.520]   have the mind of Christ.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.040]   Well, I think I've established my contention to you.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.160]   That in every verse in this chapter,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.920]   the apostle has been showing us
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.680]   the utter, entire, and complete contrast
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.600]   between the wisdom of the gospel,
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.960]   the wisdom of God,
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   and every form of human wisdom,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.400]   even at its very best and highest.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.200]   And yet, as I say,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.520]   this is the whole tragedy of the world
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.880]   and of the church tonight.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.920]   That as they did in Corinth,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.360]   they're doing today.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.200]   They're mixing these things up
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.440]   and they're causing unutterable confusion.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.120]   Some reject the gospel altogether
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.960]   because of their human wisdom.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.640]   Others are turning the gospel
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.880]   into something that is of no effect.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.800]   Even the cross becomes useless
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.840]   because they express it in terms of human wisdom
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.880]   and try to understand it in their philosophies.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.000]   Now, this is the remarkable thing
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.520]   by which we are confronted today.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.360]   The two things have nothing in common.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.280]   They're altogether and entirely different.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.600]   But why is this?
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.640]   Why should they be so different?
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.960]   Well, the apostle gives us the answer here
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.160]   in this one chapter.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.600]   Why is the gospel,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.040]   the message of salvation,
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.280]   essentially different
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.560]   from everything that belongs
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.560]   to the realm of human wisdom?
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.120]   And the answer is this.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.920]   It is because it deals with the subject matter,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.080]   which is entirely and altogether different.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.760]   The subject matter is so different
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.240]   and so the method has got to be different.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.160]   I've shown you the scientific method.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.920]   What is this subject matter?
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.080]   Well, what is science concerned about?
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   It's concerned about these gadgets,
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   radio, television, rockets.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.320]   That's its realm.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.600]   It's all right.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.120]   I'm not criticizing this.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.440]   Thank God for all these modern inventions.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.720]   But those are the things
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.200]   about which human wisdom is concerned
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.440]   and with which it is competent to deal.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.880]   And it is able to do so.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.080]   Thank God for it.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.680]   All glory to these men
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   and their great scientific achievements.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.000]   But that's the realm in which they're operating.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.040]   What's the subject matter of this gospel?
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.360]   Here's the question.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.800]   What is the gospel of Jesus Christ about?
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.640]   Is it about these scientific matters?
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.440]   Of course it isn't.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.680]   Is it about politics?
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.800]   Of course it isn't.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.840]   What is the subject matter of the gospel?
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.280]   The apostle tells us in the very first chapter,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   in the very first verse of this chapter,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.040]   "And I, brethren, when I came to you,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.760]   "came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.160]   "declaring unto you the testimony of God,
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.680]   "the attested truth concerning God."
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.720]   What's the subject matter of the gospel?
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.800]   It is the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.280]   Did you notice it in this chapter?
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:07.120]   God the Father, Jesus Christ, God the Son,
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.800]   and then the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.680]   God has revealed them unto us by his spirit.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.640]   This is the subject matter of the gospel.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.840]   It isn't, you know, primarily about men.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.880]   It's about God.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.240]   It's a revelation of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.680]   The great mystery of God.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.600]   That's the subject matter of this gospel.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:37.120]   And the apostle goes on to expound this and to unfold it.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.360]   And the moment you realize that this is the subject matter of the gospel,
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.600]   you realize how utterly useless is all human wisdom,
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.240]   even at its best and at its very highest.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.680]   Can a man by searching find out God?
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:59.760]   Can a man ascend into that eternal realm
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.600]   where God who is light and in whom is no darkness at all dwelleth?
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.240]   The thing is preposterous.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.120]   God is spirit.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.240]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.520]   It's impossible.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.920]   And yet the modern man says, "I don't understand this,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.200]   and because it doesn't conform to the rules of my scientific outlook,
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.400]   I'm going to reject it."
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.160]   Oh, what a fool the modern man is.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.600]   What a baby is, even in the realm of thought.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.920]   Fancy bringing his abilities and his methods into a subject
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.320]   which by definition excludes it all.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.000]   If man could understand God, he'd be equal to God.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.560]   God, by definition, is altogether other.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.160]   He's the absolute and the eternal, the everlasting God.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.600]   That's the subject matter.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.760]   And then you see the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.160]   I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.320]   And again, it goes on to elaborate that, you remember.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.720]   It says, "We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.640]   even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory,
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.720]   which none of the princes of this world knew,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.200]   for had they known it, they would not have crucified."
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.840]   The Lord of glory.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.800]   What's the subject matter of our gospel, of our Christian message?
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.160]   Oh, it is Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.640]   Well, who is he?
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.480]   Here is the mystery of mysteries.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.360]   The wisdom of God in a mystery.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:38.400]   Jesus, a man, and that's what the world said of him.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.040]   This fellow, as I say, they dismissed him.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.120]   The princes of this world didn't know him.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.520]   They looked at him and saw nothing in him but a man.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.640]   And so they rejected him and regarded him as an imposter.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.720]   But who is this?
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.840]   Here's my message, says Paul.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.600]   And here is something that eludes the highest and the greatest wisdom of men.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.200]   This is the Lord of glory.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.400]   Had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.640]   My friends, this is the subject matter of Christianity.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.400]   The mystery of Christ, God, and men.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.080]   Two natures, one person.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.000]   The incarnation.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.040]   Here's our theme.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.920]   It's so entirely different from everything that man's interested in
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.600]   and is competent to deal with.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.880]   Let me put this point to you in the great words of Charles Wesley in one of his great hymns.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.440]   He puts it so perfectly.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.760]   He seems to invite us to go with him to Bethlehem, and to go to that stable,
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.840]   and to look there at a little babe lying in a manger.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.800]   "I will look at him," says Charles Wesley.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.600]   "Who is he?"
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.120]   "Oh," says the world, "it's just a little babe lying in a manger.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.640]   There's nothing to get excited about.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.040]   Wait a minute," says Charles Wesley.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.800]   Charles Wesley, "veiled in flesh, the Godhead see.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.640]   Hail incarnate deity!"
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.720]   Here's mystery.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.760]   Here's paradox.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.920]   The maker and the creator and the sustainer of the universe
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.400]   lying as a helpless babe in a manger.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.520]   This is what we are talking about.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.120]   What's the value of your scientific formulae here?
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.560]   Where is your philosophy?
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.840]   Where's all the wisdom of this world and its scribes?
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:31.360]   How utterly foolish it is, and how mad is man in trying to unravel the mystery.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.240]   The apostle Paul never said he understood it.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.480]   He stands back one afternoon and says,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.520]   "Great mystery of godliness.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.920]   God was manifest in the flesh."
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.420]   That's it.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.360]   It's entirely out of the realm of human wisdom, isn't it?
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.200]   In every single respect.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.800]   And then he tells us about the death and the cross.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.120]   "Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.640]   The mystery and the marvel of the cross.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   "When I survey the wondrous cross that Isaac watched,
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.360]   on which the Prince of Glory died."
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.440]   This paradox, this contradiction.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.120]   Prince of Glory dying.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:13.760]   Madness.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.480]   Impossible.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.120]   But it's happened.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.480]   "Prince of Glory died, my richest gain.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.280]   I count but loss and poor contempt.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.040]   On all my pride of knowledge and learning and philosophy,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.320]   and all of the law that I've gathered in the universities.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.280]   It's ridiculous."
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.640]   The Prince of Glory dying.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.160]   But this is the subject matter.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.320]   The atoning sacrifice.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.160]   God's way of redemption.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.400]   God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.360]   And then he goes on to tell us, you see,
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.200]   that all this has happened for us.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.160]   This is the wisdom of God in a mystery.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.080]   Even the hidden wisdom which God obtained before the world.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.680]   Unto our glory.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.000]   All this has happened that we might be redeemed.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.400]   The Son of God dies that we might be forgiven.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.320]   That we might be reconciled unto him.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.720]   And the Spirit is sent.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.080]   And he comes and does his amazing work of regeneration.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.600]   And puts his Spirit into us.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.840]   And gives us an understanding that we never had.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.120]   And so we have the mind of Christ.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.000]   This is what the gospel is about.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.080]   And you see, the moment you realize the essential character
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.000]   of the subject matter of this gospel.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.800]   You see how utterly monstrous and ridiculous and foolish it is
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.480]   for man ever to come with his wisdom and learning and understanding.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.680]   And apply it to this.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.400]   He's already gone astray.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.480]   And that is the whole tragedy of the world and of the church at this moment.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.640]   My dear friend, we must make this perfectly clear.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.560]   When you come into the Christian church
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.880]   and listen to this gospel as it is in truth.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.280]   You've got to realize that everything you are outside in the world
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.400]   is of no value here.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   Doesn't matter who you are.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.360]   Doesn't matter what your natural ability is.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.280]   Doesn't matter what your degrees and diplomas.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.960]   Your academic attainments.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.640]   What knowledge you may have garnered.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.080]   It's all useless to you.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.640]   When you come into the realm of the church.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.480]   The Pharisee is as helpless as the publican.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.760]   The greatest sage is as helpless as a newborn babe.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.360]   It isn't only the Apostle Paul who says this.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   Our blessed Lord said it.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.640]   "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.320]   except he be converted and become as little children,
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.520]   he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.200]   He said it again.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.040]   "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.160]   that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.480]   and hast revealed them unto babes.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.600]   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight."
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.040]   And yet men will bring their human wisdom to this.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.280]   The outsider does it and he rejects it.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.720]   Men inside the church bring their philosophy and their learning
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.560]   and their human wisdom and ability.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.600]   And they make the cross of Christ of none effect
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.040]   through their philosophy.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.760]   That's the great problem in the church at this very moment.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.520]   It is the failure to see this basic elementary thing.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.200]   That the very character of the gospel makes it impossible
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.080]   for human wisdom ever to understand it
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.280]   or to be competent with respect to it.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.080]   Let me sum up this again in great words
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.840]   by Charles Wesley once more.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.880]   He looked at all this one afternoon
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.400]   and this is how he put it.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.920]   "'Tis mystery all, the immortal guise
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.960]   who can explore his strange design.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   In vain the firstborn seraph tries
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.680]   to sound the depths of love divine.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.520]   'Tis mercy all,
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:21.440]   let earth adore, let angel minds inquire no more.'
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.000]   What is the subject matter?
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   The apostles put it in that 10th verse.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.840]   "God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit."
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.720]   What is it?
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.760]   "Well, the Spirit, he says, searcheth all things,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.120]   yea, the deep things of God.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.600]   The abysmal depths of the wisdom of God,
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.000]   the deep things of God.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.840]   'Tis mystery all from beginning to end."
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.280]   And you notice the boldness of Charles Wesley
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.720]   who can explore his strange design.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.400]   "In vain the firstborn seraph tries
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.880]   to sound the depths of love divine.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.040]   'Tis mercy all, what's man to do about it?
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.560]   Let earth adore."
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.360]   And then he says, "Let angel minds,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.760]   all you seraphs and archangels,
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.880]   let angel minds inquire no more.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.120]   You might as well give up," says Charles Wesley,
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.640]   "you'll never understand it.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   It's a mystery to you, this manifold wisdom of God,
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.560]   the deep things of God."
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.520]   Very well, my friends, you see,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.160]   it is because of the subject matter of the gospel
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.320]   that human wisdom is utterly incompetent
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.240]   and should never enter into this realm.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   I close by making this remark.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:47.520]   Isn't it astonishing that men and women
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.400]   are annoyed by this instead of thanking God for it?
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.440]   You know, we ought to thank God
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.360]   that the gospel is as it does.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.760]   But men want to understand
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.920]   and they bring their minds and their abilities.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.080]   And if I don't understand it, I'm not going to believe it.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.600]   They say in their utter folly.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.480]   "Oh, this is the tragedy of men.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.040]   His ultimate trouble is intellectual pride and conceit.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.280]   He glories in himself."
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.040]   Instead of doing what Paul has told us
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.480]   at the end of the first chapter,
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.200]   "He that glorious, let him glory in the Lord."
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.040]   Why should we thank God that it is as it does?
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.560]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   If this gospel and this salvation
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.240]   were something that depended upon man's wisdom
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.520]   and knowledge and capacity and understanding and power,
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.440]   well, then it would only be a salvation
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   for a very few great and exceptional people, wouldn't it be?
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.280]   What if you did have to know philosophy and science
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.760]   in order to understand salvation and receive it?
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.960]   Well, you know, just a handful of men would be saved
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.560]   and the rest of us would be irretrievably damned and lost.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.840]   Thank God that his way of salvation
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.360]   is so utterly and entirely different from ours.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.920]   Human wisdom and science postulate ability in us
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.120]   and endeavor and seeking and searching and striving.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.040]   What does this demand of us?
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.240]   Simply that we know that we are paupers.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.000]   Simply that we repent and admit and confess
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.520]   that we've got nothing at all.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.600]   That we are blind and lost and damned
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.120]   and hopeless and helpless.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.640]   Oh, the tragedy that men should object
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.120]   to the most glorious thing about the gospel,
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.840]   that it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.800]   and not the power of men.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.600]   Because it is the power of God, there's hope for all of us.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.560]   And you see how ridiculous the thing has become.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.520]   So many today in this and other lands
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.160]   seem to think that unless you've got this great understanding
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.960]   and can read philosophy, you can't understand the gospel.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.440]   Well, if that were so, what would be the point
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.920]   of sending foreign missionaries to the heart of Africa
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.560]   or to the Australian aborigines?
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.080]   What's the point of sending people to preach the gospel
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.080]   to men and women who can't even learn an alphabet
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.320]   and have never read a word in their lives
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.360]   and cannot follow any kind of argument or disputation?
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.680]   The thing would be ridiculous, it'd be useless.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.040]   But you see, that isn't the gospel.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.920]   It's the power of God unto salvation
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.840]   and the Spirit reveals He, it is His power,
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.600]   it's not our understanding,
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.160]   it's the power that He gives to us
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.240]   that enables us to understand
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.880]   the whole basis of the missionary enterprise
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.280]   is that this is the revelation of God
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.640]   and the Spirit of God
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.600]   that these things are freely given to us of God
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.520]   and we but receive them in our utter absolute helplessness
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.960]   and then proceed to understand them and to enjoy them.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.440]   You see, this is an utter contradiction of the gospel
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.960]   in every single respect the moment you begin to think of it
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.920]   and this, I say, is the final tragedy of the world.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.120]   The apostle puts it, you notice, like this,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.560]   "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect,
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.760]   "yet not the wisdom of this world
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.960]   "nor of the princes of this world that come to naught."
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.560]   And this is what we've got to say to the world tonight.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.920]   The world is proud of its wisdom,
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.000]   proud of its understanding,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.840]   proud of its achievement,
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.240]   proud of its great scientific method,
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.440]   but you know where it's going to bring it?
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.240]   The apostle has told us it comes to naught,
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.080]   nothing, a cipher.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.600]   It appears to be wonderful,
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.160]   but in the end there'll be nothing.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.040]   It comes to naught, nothing, emptiness, void, vacuity.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.760]   "Yet men hold on to their wisdom
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   "and reject this great and glorious gospel
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.240]   "which is the wisdom and the power of God
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:14.320]   "unto salvation to every one that believeth."
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.120]   Why is it that men reject such a gospel?
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.640]   And I'm afraid the answer is but too plain and clear.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.280]   It is because they feel that it insults them.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.680]   They want to understand.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.800]   They want to rely on their own abilities
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.560]   and they hold on to it.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.200]   And here they are with their world in flames,
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.680]   going to hell, and yet they still hold on.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.200]   They won't submit.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.400]   They won't come down.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.840]   They won't accept this.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.600]   They say, "Any fool can do that."
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.800]   And they, of their learning,
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.720]   their advance of knowledge and of education,
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.560]   we are asked to deny it all this day.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.800]   We can't permit intellectual suicide.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.040]   And so they will not accept it.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.200]   And so their world goes on hurtling itself
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.480]   from disaster to disaster
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.080]   and it will end in the final doom of nothing.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.800]   It is all because of men's pride.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.360]   Let me close by quoting to you that great hymn
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.480]   of Horatius Bonner in which he's put it all so perfectly.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.680]   "I heard the voice of Jesus say,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:27.760]   'Come unto me and drink.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.720]   Stoop down, thou thirsty one, stoop down.'"
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.560]   You remember the invitation?
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.520]   He invites us to drink.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.440]   Why won't the world do this?
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.480]   Well, the explanation is given in the verse.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.640]   "I heard the voice of Jesus say,
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.400]   'Behold, I freely give the living water,
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.120]   thirsty one, stoop down.'"
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.580]   That's it.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.160]   "Stoop down and drink and live."
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.720]   Everything the world needs tonight is there.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.360]   The fountain was opened on Calvary's Hill.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.640]   There is the water, the word of life, everything you need.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.440]   But you can't drink of a fountain standing erect.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.040]   Before you can drink out of a fountain,
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.480]   you've got to bend on your knees.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.160]   You may lie prostrate on the ground.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.880]   You've got to stoop down and drink and live.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.200]   At the moment your parched lips touch that cooling stream,
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.640]   everything is changed.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.200]   But the modern man, he won't.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.360]   He prefers to stand and stagger on his feet in his inability
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.880]   and go to hell, I say,
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.760]   rather than just become a little child
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.400]   and stoop down and drink and live.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.720]   If only he did, he'd be able to join Horatius Bonner in saying,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.880]   "I came to Jesus and I drank of that life-giving stream.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.280]   My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.920]   and now I live in him."
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:03.040]   My dear friends, this is the great question of the hour.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   Are you banking and basing your whole position
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.920]   on human wisdom and understanding and knowledge
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   or on the revelation of the wisdom of God,
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:21.360]   primarily in the Lord Jesus Christ made known to us
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.520]   in this infallible Word of God?
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.600]   Oh, the tragedy of the folly
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.600]   of pitting human wisdom and understanding
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.000]   against the deep things of God.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.000]   May God apply his message to us
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.160]   that we all may know that we are ready to be fools
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.360]   for Christ's sake.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.320]   If any man, says Paul in the next chapter,
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.400]   willest to be wise in this world,
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.760]   let him become a fool and believe this gospel,
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:02.000]   become a little child that he may be made wise.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.720]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.560]   of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.160]   All of the sermons contained within
