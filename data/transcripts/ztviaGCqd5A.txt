[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.700]   Now, as we resume these studies in Paul's epistle to the Romans, I would again perhaps
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.480]   remind you and those especially who have not been attending hitherto that we try to end
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.680]   this meeting round about roughly half past seven. I suppose the average would be about
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.920]   twenty-five to eight. That is our endeavor and I try to keep to it as best I can and
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.440]   I promise to do so again. One other word I would say. Some of you may have thought that
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.460]   we took a long time in working through that first chapter. We met on twenty-nine separate
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.160]   occasions to consider the first chapter. Now, when you consider the nature and the character
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.920]   of that chapter, that indeed is not at all surprising. There, as I try to show, the apostle
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:03.160]   introduces all his major themes. He puts them all before us. Now, having done that, he begins
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.860]   to expound them and I think you will find that we shall be able to proceed at a much
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.200]   more rapid rate than we did in the case of the first chapter. The argument is much more
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.000]   loose. It is not so closely knit. I say that particularly about the second chapter. When
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.520]   we come to parts of the third chapter, again, we shall find that every word has a tremendous
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.760]   significance. But on the whole, I think you will find that we will be moving a little
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.960]   more rapidly. Well, now this evening we come to the second chapter and we start by reading
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.440]   these words which are found in the first verse. "Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O men,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.080]   whosoever thou art that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.840]   for thou that judgest doest the same things." The first thing, obviously, we've got to do
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.720]   here is this, is to get our setting. Now, this is just a little talk about the way of
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.640]   approaching a passage of Scripture, which applies not only to this, but to any other
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.420]   passage whatsoever. The way to approach Scripture always is this. First of all, take your hope
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.680]   of the whole passage, read it right through, before you start with any particulars. Try
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.400]   and find out what it's about in general. What is the big theme? What's he setting out to
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   do? Now, we've got to do that with this chapter. And fortunately for us, he provides us with
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.840]   the key in the very first word. "Therefore, wherefore?" In other words, he tells us that
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   he is continuing something that he's already been saying. At least, what he's going to
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:51.440]   say comes out of that, as a direct relationship to that. So that we can't proceed to consider
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.880]   this second chapter of this epistle without again reminding ourselves and being perfectly
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.120]   clear in our minds as to what it was he's been talking about. Now, that's why I began
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.080]   reading just now at the 16th verse of the first chapter, where the apostle introduces
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.400]   the great theme of this entire epistle, this gospel, this message from God, which is the
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.520]   power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.440]   Greek. What is it? Well, it is a righteousness from God. That's the great question, how can
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.560]   a man be right with God? Well, here is the answer. The gospel is a great proclamation
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.400]   to the effect that God has provided a righteousness for men. A righteousness by faith, not a righteousness
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.720]   that men works out, something given by God. Therein is revealed the righteousness of God
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.680]   from faith to faith, as it is written, "The just shall live by faith." Well, why is this
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.360]   necessary? Well, he tells us in verse 18, "For the wrath of God has been revealed from
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.400]   heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.440]   There is a universal statement. The wrath of God is against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:27.080]   of men. Very well, then, there is his great theme. This righteousness from God, this only
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.600]   way of righteousness, therefore, in the light of this other doctrine of the wrath of God.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.360]   And then you remember, in the remainder of the chapter, the apostle proceeds to work
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.400]   out this particular proof in the case of the Gentiles in particular. And he leads us through
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.320]   that terrible description. God, he says, has manifested his wrath against all ungodliness
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.480]   and unrighteousness in the case of the Gentiles, in that he has abandoned them. He has given
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.680]   them up. He has given them over. He has given them over to a reprobate mind. He has given
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.760]   them over to working these terrible things between one and another. That is an absolute
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.920]   proof, as we saw, of the wrath of God against ungodliness and sin, and particularly in the
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:29.360]   case of those Gentiles. Very well, he said all that. Well, what now, then? Well, he seems,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:37.920]   as it were, to hear somebody shouting out, "Amen!" Quite right, I am in absolute agreement.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:47.560]   "Wait a minute," says the apostle, "therefore thou art inexcusable, O men, whosoever thou
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.960]   art that judges." Now then, there is our setting. In other words, let me put it to you like
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:03.320]   this. The great question that arises at this moment for every one of us is this. What is
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.600]   our understanding of what Paul has been saying from the 16th verse of the first chapter to
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.040]   the end of the chapter? That is the question. That is the very question that the apostle
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.160]   himself has been raising. He has said tremendous things. Yes, but the whole point is this.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   Have we understood what he said? Have we really got his meaning? Are we really in agreement
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.400]   with what the apostle is saying, and not simply with what we think he is saying? For the apostle
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:47.040]   here raises before us the image of a man who has misunderstood him. A man who says, "I
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.960]   am in entire agreement with what you have just said, Paul." And Paul says, "You are
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.240]   not, you know. You think you are, but you are not, and I am going to prove it to you.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.920]   You say, 'Amen, hallelujah, I am in agreement,' because you think you know what I have said,
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.820]   but you don't know what I have said. You haven't understood my meaning." So he has to take
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:15.340]   up the case of this man. Now then, this is obviously equally important for all of us,
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.660]   because the apostle here is saying quite plainly that it is possible for all of us to misunderstand
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:27.360]   what he has just been saying. And therefore, in a sense, what I should have done before
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.120]   we all came to this meeting tonight, I should have written to you one by one, and I should
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.200]   have sent you this bit of homework. Please tell me what it is Paul is saying in Romans
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.800]   1, verse 16 to the end of the chapter. And then we would have known exactly whether we
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:51.880]   had understood or not. Very well then, here he is, at any rate, addressing now a man who
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.440]   thought that he was in entire agreement, but the apostle is going to show him that he is
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:03.680]   not. The great question at this point is, "Who is this man? Therefore thou art inexcusable,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:12.260]   O men, whosoever thou art that judges." And at this point, you will find that the commentators
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:19.280]   throughout the centuries have divided themselves up generally into two main schools. The one
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:27.600]   school has said that the apostle here, obviously, is still considering the Gentiles. He is considering
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.120]   people amongst the Gentiles who are not guilty of those particular terrible sins that he
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.640]   has just been portraying. He is thinking, they say, of certain moral pagans, certain
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   good pagans. Because they say, "Oh pagans, you know, don't live that sort of life.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.920]   All pagans are not guilty of those foul perversions and those other terrible things. There is
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.800]   such a thing after all as a good pagan. There is a moral pagan and there is the kind of
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   pagan who has gone in for philosophy. There were many great pagan philosophers and they
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.440]   exalted men to live a good life and so on. Now they say, surely, he is dealing with them.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.800]   These pagans who might come along and say, "Oh, it's all right, we are in entire
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.280]   agreement with what you are saying, Paul. We have been denouncing these sins ourselves."
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.840]   And they say that Paul is dealing with them and showing them their error. That's one
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.800]   school. The other school says, "No, that the apostle here is taking up the case of
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.000]   the Jew, that he is dealing immediately with Jews." The other people, the first group
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.400]   incidentally, they say that Paul doesn't start dealing with the Jews until the 17th
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.760]   verse of this second chapter, where he addresses the Jew quite directly saying, "Behold,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.520]   thou art called a Jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of God." They say
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.440]   he doesn't touch the Jews until you come to that point. Now the second school says,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.280]   "No, that's wrong. He starts with the Jews in the first verse of the second chapter.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   Is there any way of settling this?" Well, I suppose in a sense there is no final way
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.800]   of settling it. You can take one or the other, but it seems to me quite clear that this is
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:15.440]   indeed a reference to the Jews, at any rate to the Jews primarily. I think perhaps that
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.320]   the two schools have pressed their point a little bit too far. I'm not trying to work
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.080]   a compromise between them. That's not my habit. But I think that there is a danger
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.480]   here of overemphasizing the one or the other. I would prefer to say that he's dealing
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.520]   primarily with the Jew, but also incidentally with the Gentile and anybody else who may
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   happen to hold this particular position. Why do I say that? Well, for this reason. His
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:49.600]   great emphasis, you see, is on "thou that judgest." "Whosoever thou art that judgest."
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:57.440]   His great emphasis is on this judgment, this condemnation. And that, it seems to me, is
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.600]   surely enough really to settle the whole question, because that was the great, not to say the
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.960]   greatest, characteristic of the Jew at that particular time.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.080]   There are other things which make me say that this is dealing with the Jew. You notice that
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.200]   already in verse 9 he brings in the Jew, "tribulation, anguish, upon every soul of men that doeth
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.000]   evil to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile." As he already began to speak about the Jew
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.600]   and the Gentile in verse 16, and has used this great word "all ungodliness and unrighteousness,"
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.760]   I suggest that he's dealing with them all along. But there it is, it's there quite
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.840]   specifically, and he repeats it again in verse 10, "to every man that worketh good, to
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.680]   the Jew first, also to the Gentile," and then this clinching argument, "for there
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:54.200]   is no respect of persons with God." Now that was the central fallacy of the Jew, to
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:02.240]   think that there was this kind of respect of persons with God.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.080]   In other words, you know that the Jews at that time divided the whole world into two
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:18.680]   groups only, the Jews and those who are not Jews. The Jews, the chosen people of God,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:26.000]   the dogs, the outsiders, those people without the law, and their attitude towards them was
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.760]   one of utter condemnation. Now there are abundant passages in the Scripture which prove that,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.720]   there's no need for me to remind you of them, you get this dealt with in the Gospels,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.600]   you see it in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, you get it in these various epistles.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.200]   Indeed one of the greatest problems of the early evangelists was how to deal with that
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:54.360]   particular situation. The Jew, you see, felt that he didn't need salvation because he
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.440]   was one of the children of the people of God. Those Gentiles, well, it was impossible in
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.400]   their case, how could such people ever have salvation because they had nothing at all
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:09.960]   to do with God. So they objected to the Gospel for two reasons. One, that the Christian preacher
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.360]   said that the Jew needed salvation. And secondly, that he said it was possible for the Gentile
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:22.280]   to be saved also. And they hated both sides. You see, you read your Gospels and you see
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.480]   those Pharisees arguing with our Lord and quarreling and debating and trying to trip
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.440]   him and to trap him. Why? Well, there's only one explanation. His preaching made them feel
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.120]   that even they were sinners and they hated him for it. But it was an essential part of
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.960]   his message. There is none righteous, no, not one. All have sinned and have come short
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.400]   of the glory of God. Well, therefore, I suggest to you that this argument here is primarily
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:58.080]   an argument about the Jew. He's taking up the case of the Jew who condemns the Gentile
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.000]   and who therefore, when he hears Paul condemning the Gentile, says, "Amen, I'm in entire
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.480]   agreement." But, as I say, we mustn't confine it only to the Jew because it is equally true
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:19.800]   of all who take the same kind of position and attitude as the Jews took with respect
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.920]   to themselves and with respect to others. Now then, let me try to show you the setting.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   Here is the apostle, you see. He has shown how the wrath of God has been revealed against
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:36.160]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men in the case of the Gentiles. And immediately
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   he hears the Jew saying, "Absolutely right, Paul. There you're striking the nail on its
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.040]   very head. That's what we've always said about those Gentiles. There is nothing too bad to
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.520]   be said about them. Look at them. Look at the way they're living. There they are. They're
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:57.680]   dogs. They're to be damned. And there's no more to be said about them."
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:05.600]   But wait a minute, says Paul. You're not in agreement with me. And you think you're in
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.480]   agreement with me because you've misunderstood two things. You are shouting your "Amen."
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:17.200]   You're saying your "Hallelujah" for two wrong reasons. What are they? Well, here's the first.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:25.000]   The Jew thought that Paul was condemning the Gentiles simply because they were Gentiles,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.160]   and therefore doing what they did. They wouldn't listen to any arguments about the Gentile.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.880]   A Gentile was a Gentile. That was enough. He was damned. And they thought that Paul
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:39.560]   was saying that, but Paul isn't saying that. That's the first thing.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:50.680]   They also thought that this was not true of them simply because they were Jews. It was
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.280]   true of the Gentiles because they were Gentiles. It was not true of the Jew. Why? Well, because
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:01.240]   he was a Jew and not a Gentile, and because he was such a special man. So you see there's
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:10.160]   a double error. But I must add something to this. They thought that the Apostle was showing
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:18.560]   God's wrath upon the Gentiles simply because they were Gentiles, and not at all because
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:26.240]   of the way in which they lived. Gentiles alone, apart from what Gentiles did. And in the same
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.920]   way exactly, they thought that all this did not apply to them simply because they were
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:40.280]   Jews, and irrespective of how they might live or not live. They were excluding actions,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.960]   behavior, conduct, all together, and they were determining the whole thing in terms
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:51.760]   of are you a Jew or are you not a Jew. But you see the Apostle here is going on to
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:17:01.480]   prove that if you understand that great section like that, you are missing the whole point.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:11.000]   The Jews, you see, thought that because they were Jews, and simply because of that fact
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.080]   that they were already saved, whatever they might do, whatever they might be. And in saying
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:25.000]   that, and in regarding the Gentiles as utterly damned and lost, irrespective of anything,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.040]   simply because they were Gentiles, they were denying the very essence of the gospel. They
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:39.160]   were contradicting the very foundation of the gospel and the Christian way of salvation.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:46.880]   And as a result of doing that, they were leading themselves to certain other terrible consequences,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.320]   which the Apostle indicates in the body of this second chapter.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.840]   Now he puts it like this. Let me give you a bird's eye view of the chapter. The Jew
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:05.280]   first and foremost was resting on the fact that he was a Jew. Then if you argued with
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.080]   him about that and showed him how that was not enough, he then said, "Well, but I've
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:14.320]   got a second argument. God gave us the law, and the fact that he has given us the law
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.280]   is absolute proof that we are his people and that we are saved. We've got the law. Nobody
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:25.760]   else has it." That was their second. And thirdly, they said, "We've got a still greater argument,
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.920]   circumcision." And they said, "How can you say that we and the Gentiles are one? What
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.400]   you mean by saying that this is the power of God and the salvation to everyone that
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.120]   believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek? We don't need your salvation. You
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.720]   mustn't put us in and lump us in like that with the Greeks. We have nothing to do with
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.600]   them. We're absolutely separate. You mustn't say that we are guilty like this and that
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:55.720]   we need justification by faith only. We are Jews, and we can prove we are Jews." Now
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:04.120]   that's the position. The Jews thought that they were in an entirely separate position
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.280]   and that therefore they must never be considered together with the Gentiles. Now the Apostle,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:17.800]   you see, deals with these three positions. In verses 1 to 16, he takes that first argument
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:23.920]   that they were all right as they were simply because they were Jews. There are subdivisions
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.440]   of it which we'll consider. Then from verse 17 to verse 24, he takes their argument about
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:36.200]   the law. And from verse 25 to the end of the chapter, he takes their argument based on
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:46.520]   the fact and the sign of circumcision. And he will work out these three arguments separately
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:54.600]   and in detail. Now that's what you and I have got to do. But you know, before we're
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.280]   going to do it, I'm going to do something else. And I'm going to spend the rest of
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.680]   this evening in doing something else. And what is that? Well, it's this. I'm going
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:13.760]   to apply all that to ourselves, to us. For the Scriptures, you know, have been written
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:20.640]   for an example, for our instruction. That's the glory of the Word of God. It's always
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.160]   up to date, it's always relevant. This isn't just an account of a position that confronted
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:31.120]   Paul when he was preaching nearly two thousand years ago. It's as true tonight as it was
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.560]   then. And it may be true of us, unless we must examine ourselves. And I say we must
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.200]   examine ourselves in this light, in the light of our understanding of the first chapter,
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.400]   verse 16 to the end of the chapter. There are certain terrible lessons here, it seems
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:56.080]   to me. What is it? Well, I'll put it in general first. It's this. Paul here is proceeding
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:06.640]   to unveil to us the terrible character of sin. In that first chapter we saw the foulness
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.760]   and the vileness of sin. We seem to be walking through the gutters of life and felt we needed
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:21.520]   a bath after it, with all those terrible unnatural perversions and all those other things that
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.880]   are almost unmentionable. But there they are. Now, he's dealt there with the vileness
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.560]   and the foulness of sin. Now what is he going to do? Well, now he's going to deal with
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:38.520]   what we may well call the subtlety of sin. The subtlety of it all. Well, where does the
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.280]   subtlety come in, says someone? Well, the subtlety comes in in the way that I've already
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.200]   indicated to you. You see it perfectly, don't you, in the case of the Jews. Here they were,
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   you see, listening to all that and saying, "Absolutely right, 100% with you, Paul.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:58.560]   What you are saying about those wretched Gentiles is nothing but the truth." And you see, it
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.840]   was because of this subtlety of sin that they ever said that. They didn't see the real
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.600]   statement, they didn't follow the argument, and they failed to see its application to
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.760]   themselves. Now that is, I say, the thing that we've got to consider. Let me put it
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:17.480]   to you like this. To show you how this afflicts us all, and how constantly we've got to
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.320]   guard ourselves against this very pitfall into which the Jews of old fell. Don't forget
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.080]   that these were God's people. They'd been called by God. They were the people who had
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.800]   the scriptures. They were the people who read them and studied them and gloried in them.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.000]   Yet with all that, here they are. They crucified their own Messiah. They did their best to
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.720]   prevent the Gentiles being saved. They did their best to exterminate Christianity. What
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.960]   a terrible position. What a terrible possibility. Now then, let me divide it up like this.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:57.880]   We see, don't we, how sin introduces, or can introduce, a prejudice into our listening
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:05.440]   to the gospel or into our reading of the gospel. How does it do it? Well, like this. Given
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.320]   our prejudice, you see, when we come to the scriptures, we pick out what we like and we
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:15.360]   don't notice what we don't like. That's exactly what these Jews had done. All they
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.520]   heard when Paul said this sort of thing was that God's wrath was upon the Gentiles.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.760]   "Hear, hear," they said. But they didn't listen to the rest. You see, they were blinded
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.120]   by their prejudice. Jew, Gentile. And this was the one big thing. So this governed everything.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.720]   So that when they read their scriptures, they only saw this and they saw nothing else at
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:45.320]   all. And isn't it still a possibility? How easy it is to read the scriptures, and just
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.160]   to pick out what you like and to leave the rest. Some people do that even in their reading
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.080]   of the Bible. They only read certain parts of the Bible. They say, "We find it very
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.640]   comforting. It's very nice." And it never disturbs them, of course, because they only
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.360]   want comfort, and they go for comfort, and they get nothing but comfort. They take parts
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.960]   of the scripture, leave the rest. That's one way. But it can be done, I say, in that
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.800]   other way. You can be listening to a sermon or an address, you can be reading your scripture,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.600]   and you really just pick out all that pleases you, and you take no notice of the rest at
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:22.520]   all. Or to put it in yet another form, isn't this a terrible danger always? That we, sometimes,
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.360]   some of us tend to read the scriptures not so much to be enlightened and to be taught,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:33.440]   but to confirm our own theories, our own ideas, and our own prejudices. Now, I want to make
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:39.120]   that a universal statement. We are all guilty of it. Let me put it to you like this. It's
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.080]   the danger of the Calvinist, who looks for one thing only and ignores difficulties. It's
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.040]   the equal danger of the Arminian, who only looks what he wants and doesn't notice the
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.080]   other stresses and emphases. Each one sees only part, ignores the rest. We're all guilty.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.920]   What's your view of prophecy? What's your view of sanctification? What's your view of
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.080]   all these doctrines? In the name of God, I say, let's be careful that we don't go with
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.920]   such a prejudice to the scripture that we only pick out what agrees with our theory
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.800]   and ignore and forget the rest. Let's come to it with an open mind and an open heart,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:18.560]   whatever it may have to say, and let's look at it in every detail and beware of prejudice.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.440]   The second danger is this, that sin in its subtlety tends to make us put ourselves into
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:29.880]   special categories and compartments. That is an outcome of the first, isn't it? You
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:38.880]   see, the Jew, I'm a Jew, Gentile, and we all are given to these labels. They're terrible
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.840]   things, these labels. We should avoid them as the very plague, but people are very fond
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.360]   of putting labels on us and we sometimes like them. I'm a so-and-so, you know how people
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.920]   say. I'm a Methodist, I'm a Salvationist, I'm this, that, or the other. No, no, we are
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:26:01.200]   Christians primarily and we mustn't put the label first. Here it is, we tend to put ourselves
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.240]   into categories and compartments and then, of course, go on doing what I've already been
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.440]   saying, find statements to confirm us and to buttress our position. And then a third
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.600]   way, of course, is this, isn't it? The subtlety of sin makes us apply the truth that we're
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:24.760]   listening to to other people, but not to ourselves. Quite right, we say. These abominable sins,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.240]   you see them as you walk along the streets in London, you read about them in the newspapers,
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.880]   and you're impatient with those people. You feel they ought to be blasted out of existence.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:43.240]   You see it so clearly. We see it as it applies to others, never in the case of ourselves.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:49.280]   We tend to be blind to our own sins. This is all that was true about the Jews as we
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.720]   shall see. But you see, there's no point in our going on to consider what was wrong with
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.840]   the Jews if we fail to see it in ourselves. That's the very error of the Jew. So I can't
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.040]   take you on until we all realize that we are looking at ourselves in the mirror that is
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.800]   here provided. How easy it is to say, "I do hope so-and-so is in the service this morning,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.720]   it was just for him." Yes, and you didn't see that it was for you. Well, now that's
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:18.080]   exactly what these Jews were doing. We protect ourselves, we can easily apply the truth to
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.840]   the others. Obvious, we say. Wonderful, wasn't it a great sermon that. And we hadn't seen
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.800]   that there was anything applicable to us at all.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:35.120]   Fourthly, we see here the many subtle ways in which sin makes us deny the cardinal basic
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:42.360]   foundational doctrine of justification by faith only. Now that's the great theme of
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.680]   this epistle. Verse 17, "The righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith." The
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.240]   just shall live by faith. This is the thing. Now then, what happens? Well, Paul is now
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.040]   going to show us how everybody's trying to avoid it and running away from it with some
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.360]   other theory or explanation. And he brings us back to it. We are all experts at running
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.960]   away from it. How do we do so? Well, you run away from the doctrine of justification by
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   faith only when you rely upon anything or anyone except the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.440]   perfect work. I don't care what it is. If you rely on your country, if you say, "I
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.600]   must be a Christian, I was born in Great Britain." Christian country, Japan pagan. If you're
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.680]   saying that sort of thing, you're denying justification by faith, as the Jew did. Or
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.440]   if you're relying on the fact that your parents were Christians or saints. Any reliance upon
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:41.280]   your birth and ancestry. Or if in any way you're relying on any form of moralism. If
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   in any way you're relying on your good life and your respectability and your good works,
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.120]   you're denying justification by faith. It was the whole curse of the Pharisee. It was
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.760]   the thing that our Lord had to fight them on, and Paul was constantly fighting them
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.840]   about the same thing. Moralism in any shape or form smugged self-satisfaction and contentment.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.560]   People who say, "You know, I really can't honestly say that I've ever felt I'm a sinner."
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   Well, if you haven't, you're not justified by faith, because you've never seen any need
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:13.280]   of it. You're all right as you are, as the Jew thought he was. And the same applies to
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.960]   ritualism. And it's one of the great menaces of this present time. There's a recrudescence
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:25.520]   of ritualism. Even in nonconformity, they're all going in for it, one after another. And
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.240]   you see, it comes to this, doesn't it, that as long as you've performed the ritual or
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.600]   the ceremony, as long as you've gone to your communion, do what you like the rest of the
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.320]   day, live as you like almost, this puts you right. You rely upon the form and the ceremonial
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:43.440]   and the ritual. That's the sort of thing he's talking about. And every time we do it, whether
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.960]   it's circumcision or anything else, we are denying justification by faith.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.560]   But come, let me give you one other. Sin in its subtlety, and this is perhaps the most
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:05.040]   important of all, it leads us to separate doctrine from life. That, as I'm hoping to
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.200]   show you, was the cardinal error of the Jew. You see, the Jew didn't take life into consideration
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:17.040]   at all, either in the case of the Gentile or in his own case. He said, "Simply because
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.200]   I am a Jew, I must be alright, I must be saved." He didn't consider how he was living.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.720]   So Paul says, "O men, whosoever thou art that judges, for wherein thou judgest another,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:32.520]   thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things." But the Jew seemed
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.240]   to say, "It doesn't matter what I do, I'm a Jew. And because I'm a Jew, I'm alright.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.120]   It doesn't matter what I do." That Gentile, of course. Now that separation of doctrine
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:49.840]   and life, and it's a terrible danger and a most subtle one. It doesn't matter whether
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.160]   you've got little doctrine or much doctrine. It's equally dangerous. There are some people
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.280]   who say, "You see, I've believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, therefore I'm alright.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.480]   I want no more. I don't want your doctrines. I don't want that deep teaching. I'm alright.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.440]   I've believed in Christ. I'm saved. I've taken my decision. Alright." And they go on living,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.320]   more or less, as they did before. But they say, "I'm a Christian. I went forward. I
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:18.520]   took my decision." Separation of doctrine and life. Their idea is somehow that because
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.800]   they now believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, well, everything's alright. And they pay
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.680]   very little attention to their mode or manner of living.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:36.560]   But there are others, you see, who are very interested in doctrine. They like to read
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.240]   books on doctrine and theology, and nothing gives them greater joy than to be arguing
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.520]   about these things. And they've got the Reformed doctrine, or whatever it is, and they're very
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:50.200]   keen on this. And this is their thing. Yes. And sometimes, even as they're arguing about
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:58.160]   it, they may be losing their tempers. And what's the value of their doctrine? Or sometimes,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.560]   they know all the doctrine in their heads, but look at their lives. Are they living as
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.960]   Christians? My friend, the more doctrine you know, the greater is your responsibility.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.560]   More is expected of you. Now, let me give you some quotations to show you that this
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:17.800]   isn't my own theory. Listen to the Lord Jesus Christ speaking to such people. "If ye know
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:27.560]   these things, happy are ye if ye do them. Not every one that saith unto me, 'Lord,
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:33.680]   Lord, Lord,' but he that doeth the will of my Father." Do you remember what he said to
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.640]   some people one afternoon? "If ye continue in my word," they said they just believed
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.480]   on him, "if ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:54.000]   the truth, and the truth shall make you free." Free from what? Free from sin. The Jews said,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.160]   "We are not sinners." He said, "Your works prove that you are sinners." And the business
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:04.800]   of the truth is to set us free, and free from sin. Now, there is our Lord's own teaching.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   But listen to the Apostle Paul saying the same thing in his epistle to Timothy, Titus,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.400]   second chapter, verse 11 and following, "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:25.240]   appeared unto all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   soberly, righteously, godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope and the
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.920]   glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:46.600]   us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:54.800]   zealous of good works." It may surprise you to hear me saying it, but I must say it. I
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.920]   don't care what your knowledge of doctrine is, it will avail you nothing, unless it has
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:07.040]   led to that, unless it has purified you and is purifying you from these dead works and
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:13.800]   making of you a person zealous of good works. Oh, the terrible danger of imagining that
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.280]   because we have a knowledge of truth that all is well, and ignoring our life and conduct
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:25.440]   and behavior. That was the very essential error of these Jews of old.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.680]   And then, here is another thing, the persistence with which we tend to do all this in defense
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.720]   of ourselves. We start with one position, then the argument knocks it down, we then
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.400]   jump to another. The Jews started with the fact that they were Jews, then they relied
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.360]   on the goodness and the mercy of God, then on the law, then on circumcision. We'll
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.720]   swatch at any straw, like a lady I once heard of, who having listened to a reformed doctrine,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.880]   suddenly had to listen to an Arminian, and who said at the end of the service, "Thank
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.560]   God there's something for us to do after all." She was glad that there was something.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:05.880]   That's the attitude. You see the subtlety of it all. Man in sin is so self-centered
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:13.000]   and so proud and so blind that he'll clutch at any kind of straw to justify himself, and
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   thereby reject God's glorious scheme of salvation and justification by faith only.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.600]   And finally it leads to this, doesn't it? That we have seen, I think, together this
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:34.200]   evening the right way of studying the Scriptures. And what is that? Well, you see, it isn't
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:39.600]   simply to rush at them, and to say, "Very well, we come on to chapter 2 of Romans. What
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.120]   have we got here? Ah yes, three points, three divisions. Very well, there's number 1, there's
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:52.640]   number 2, number 3. All right, we've finished chapter 3." No, no, my friends. No, no.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:36:01.680]   The apostle won't have it, and we mustn't have it. He calls us to stop for a moment.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.240]   He says, "We've finished chapter 1." "Ah," you say, "I've got chapter 1, I've got my
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:12.080]   notes in full, I know all about it." Do you? Are you content merely with an analysis of
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:18.480]   chapter 1? Or have you seen the message of chapter 1? Are you content simply with having
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.360]   a kind of intellectual division of the Scriptures, so that, as I once heard a man doing the whole
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.040]   of the epistle to the Romans, I think I've told you before, in one night? It was so simple,
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:34.080]   you see. Chapter 1, 1 to 15, general introduction. Verse 16, statement of theme. Then, right
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:40.640]   away to the end of chapter 5, justification by faith. Chapters 6, 7, and 8, sanctification.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.000]   Chapters 9, 10, and 11, the position of the Jew. 12 to the end, general application in
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.480]   a moral sense. We've finished the epistle to the Romans. But you see, the apostle won't
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:37:01.240]   allow us to do that. "Thou art inexcusable, O men that judgest another." You say, "I
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:07.680]   agree with what he's been saying in chapter 1." These horrible things that people are
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:17.760]   doing in London today. And you pass on. No, no. I haven't been talking only about people
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.560]   living in the gutter, says Paul. I've been talking about you. To the Jew first, and also
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.800]   to the Greek. There is none righteous, no, not one. Doesn't matter who you are, no, what
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:36.160]   you are, no, what you know, or what you're ignorant of. You're all here. We're all together.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.160]   Have we understood chapter 1? Very well, we've seen the dangers, haven't we? What I mean
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:50.760]   is this. The scripture must always be applied, so that when you've read your portion of scripture
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.200]   in the morning, or wherever you read it, you don't stop by just saying, "Oh yes, I've read
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.760]   the notes and I've got the analysis." No, no. You must say, "Well now then, what does
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.880]   this say to me? Where do I come in here? I've been reading about the Pharisees and our Lord's
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.480]   arguments with them, and His final denunciation of them. Ah, well, of course, what terrible
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:16.880]   people the Pharisees were." But you must go on and say, "Am I a Pharisee, I wonder? Is
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.320]   there anything of that in me? It may not be as blatant always. It can be there in a very
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:28.520]   small form, but is there anything of that in me?" Always apply it. Oh, I say it again.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.260]   There's no such thing in my opinion as lecturing on the Bible. The Bible must be preached.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:39.280]   It must be applied. It must be brought home. The apostle insists upon that. He won't pass
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.240]   on until he's clear and satisfied about this. He wants this to be perfectly clear to these
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.520]   people who think they've got it, but who haven't got it. So he works out the argument, and
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.860]   God willing, we shall follow him as he does so, next Friday and the following Fridays.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:39:01.200]   But above all, I do pray that we all will the whole time be examining ourselves, seeing
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.120]   its relevance and its application to us. We must put ourselves always under the Word,
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.000]   and look up at it and listen to it as it speaks to us. You must never study the Bible academically.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.280]   Never become theoretical. It's been the curse of theological seminaries. Men have gone in
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.120]   full of life. They've come out dead. Why? Academic interest in the Scriptures. Beware
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.520]   of it. It's a danger here on Friday nights. It's a danger whenever you read the Scriptures,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:32.400]   whenever you listen to a sermon. It must always be applied. Apply to ourselves, not to the
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:39.520]   other person. And pray that we all may have grace together to apply it as it comes to
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.320]   us. Let us pray.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   O Lord, our God, we do come into thy presence and acknowledge our sin and our failure. Thy
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:57.280]   Word, O God, has searched us, and we needs must plead guilty. We have so often been like
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.920]   those Jews of old, and we realize the perpetual danger. We know that there is an enemy and
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:10.880]   an adversary who would encourage our natural pride and would ever try to make us do these
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.440]   things that we have considered together. O God, forgive us that we have ever listened
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.920]   and ever fallen. We thank thee again that thou hast promised to keep us and to guide
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:27.600]   us and to enlighten us and to direct us. We rely, O God, upon that. We thank thee for
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.680]   thy love and mercy, thy longsuffering and compassion, and we commit ourselves unto thee
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:40.760]   once more. Lord, follow us with thy blessing and enable us more and more to understand
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:48.240]   thy holy Word. And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.680]   of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:41:00.520]   us now this night and evermore. Amen.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.600]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
