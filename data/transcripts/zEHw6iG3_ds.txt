[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220]   Well, Jesus seemed to say that his return was soon.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.560]   So where is he?
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.600]   And why has the church had to wait for so long?
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.800]   It's a question from a listener named Ron.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.400]   Pastor John, I am writing from Switzerland and have greatly been blessed by your ministry.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.240]   I have a question with regards to the New Testament belief that Jesus would come very
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.580]   soon.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.640]   As I was studying with our children the need to evaluate prophets by biblical criteria,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.320]   the following thought hit me.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.940]   The Bible says in Deuteronomy 18 that a prophet whose predictions don't come true is not sent
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.400]   by God and that he should not be feared.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   However, in the New Testament we find repeated evidence of people whom we would call inspired,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.920]   who evidently believed and sometimes claimed that Jesus would come back soon, even during
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.640]   the writer's own lifetime.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.240]   Examples of this include 1 Peter 4, 7; Matthew 24, 34; Matthew 26, 64; 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.800]   1 Thessalonians 4, 15-17; and 1 Corinthians 15-51.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.440]   How can we still consider them authoritative while discarding modern day messengers whose
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.840]   prophecies don't materialize?
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.080]   I am a bit uneasy that at some stage our kids will tell us that Paul was wrong about 1 Corinthians
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.360]   15-51 and so he's not to be taken seriously.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.000]   Do you have any suggestions on how to deal with this tension?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.280]   Yes, I do.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   Oh, good.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.160]   It's a large issue and has several layers, and each one needs careful, patient attention.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's fairly easy to comb through the New Testament superficially and gather a lot of texts together
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.960]   that seem to indicate a false teaching about how quickly the second coming of Jesus would
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   happen.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.360]   But if you take each one, each text or each group of texts carefully, patiently, and study
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.320]   it out with the help of those who have perhaps given more thought to it, what I have found
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.160]   is that there are explanations of how to understand those texts that do not impute error or false
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.280]   prophecy to what Jesus or the apostles taught.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.120]   So that's my first suggestion.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.600]   Don't be superficial and simply gather a lot of texts together and impute to them something
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.040]   that they may not want to say.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.200]   They may sound on the face of it incriminating about Jesus and his apostles, but individually,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.280]   carefully, patiently studied out, you may find yourself regretting any conclusion like
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.680]   that.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   So maybe the best thing I can do would be to just give five pointers to the kind of
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.400]   solutions you will find if you study these out.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.040]   So number one, sometimes the events that are expected soon are not the very coming of Jesus,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.440]   but things leading up to the coming of Jesus.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.800]   So here's an example.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:19.080]   Matthew 24, 33, "So also when you see all these things, you know that he is near at
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   the very gates."
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.920]   Next verse, and this is the problem verse for a lot of people.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.520]   "Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   place."
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.620]   Now, notice carefully the phrase, "all these things that are going to take place within
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.400]   a generation" does not include the actual coming of the Lord.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.920]   Because in the previous verse, it says, "When you see all these things," the very phrase
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.240]   of verse 34 used in verse 33, "you know he is near."
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.860]   Not already here.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.920]   So the fact that these things will happen within a generation, these preparations for
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.800]   his coming, does not mean that his coming would happen in a generation.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.600]   Now of course, it does say, "When they happen, he is near at the very gates," which leads
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.800]   to my second pointer.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.640]   When the New Testament speaks of the Lord's being near, or at the gates, or at hand, it
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.320]   is not teaching a necessary time frame for the Lord's appearance.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.240]   Rather, it's saying that Christ the Messiah, long-expected Messiah, has come once for all,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.480]   decisively, in his life and death and resurrection, fighting the major battle.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.880]   He has set in motion an end-time process of gathering Messianic people.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.560]   He has fulfilled many end-time prophecies.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   We are in the last days, have been for 2,000 years, and therefore Jesus is like a king
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.600]   in complete control, standing with his army outside the city, waiting to take it captive.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   Nothing can stand between him and that capture except his own choice.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.060]   That's the way I think we should read something like 1 Peter 4.7.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.340]   The end of all things is at hand, or James 5.8.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.600]   The coming of the Lord is at hand, or like Jesus says, he's at the gates.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.820]   That is, he has appeared, he has fought the decisive victory, he has shown himself sovereign
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.140]   and unstoppable in the resurrection, he has fulfilled vast amounts of Old Testament prophecy
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.760]   concerning the end time, and he may step in whenever he pleases.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.960]   That's the way I think we should understand near, at the gates, at hand.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.480]   Here's the third pointer or observation.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   A third kind of text uses the word "soon," like in the book of Revelation where it says,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.000]   "Behold, I am coming soon," Revelation 22.20.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.680]   Now that Greek word "taku," soon, does not always or necessarily mean what we ordinarily
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.560]   mean by the word "soon," that is, after a short space of time.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.820]   Rather, it regularly means quickly, suddenly, unexpectedly, fast.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.580]   For example, it's used in Matthew 28.8, the women at the tomb, it says, "So they departed
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.260]   quickly from the tomb."
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.340]   That's the word, soon, translated soon.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.420]   So we must always ask, is the Scripture teaching that the Lord's coming will be sudden, unexpected,
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.820]   quick, fast when it happens, in that sense, rather than soon in the sense of, say, within
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.100]   20 years?
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.980]   Pointer number four.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.740]   Amazingly, the gospel writers taught Jesus did not know the time of his coming.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.580]   Now that in itself is kind of a problem, but that's what it says, and we will deal with
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.740]   it that the human nature of Jesus was not granted knowledge of the coming that the divine
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.700]   nature of Jesus had, in some way, that mysterious thing is affirmed.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:26.340]   It says in Matthew 24.36, "Concerning the day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.500]   of heaven nor the Son, but the Father only."
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.700]   Here's the implication.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:41.020]   That means, surely, we should be very slow to impute to him predictions about the coming
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.380]   in a certain amount of time.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.240]   The Bible says he doesn't know.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.460]   So what are we saying about him when we say he predicted them?
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:59.260]   Surely, he would not have said, "I am coming in this time frame," if he didn't know.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.820]   That's not just a prediction problem.
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.760]   That's a moral problem.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.300]   We got a major moral issue that I am not going to impute to Jesus.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.180]   So for example, when he says—how are we going to solve the problems then?—when he
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.540]   says in Matthew 16.28, "Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.340]   taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.820]   What does that mean?
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.940]   Here's what's remarkable.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.460]   What's remarkable about this saying is that it occurs in Matthew, Mark, Luke, always,
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.800]   immediately before the transfiguration.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.580]   And Peter, who was one on the mountain with Jesus during the transfiguration, Peter, in
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:47.460]   his second epistle, chapter 1, verses 16 and 17, treats this experience of the transfiguration
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:54.100]   on the mountain with Jesus as a preview of the second coming, a validation—we would
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.340]   say today a movie trailer—of the second coming.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.340]   You read that.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.960]   "The second Peter," chapter 1, verses 16 and 17, and you'll see Peter takes the power
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.880]   and the coming of the Lord as a preview there on the Mount of Transfiguration, which means
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.280]   that what Jesus was saying was that some of his disciples, namely Peter, James, and John,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:27.240]   would not die before they glimpsed the second coming or the coming of the Son of Man, namely
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.000]   in what they're going to experience on the mountain six days from now.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.320]   Here's my last pointer.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.560]   Number five.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:44.440]   When Paul uses the word "we" to refer to those who may be alive at the Lord's coming, "we
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:52.400]   who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord," 1 Thessalonians 4, 15, I don't
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:10:02.080]   think we should say Paul is teaching that he must be alive when the Lord comes and that
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.440]   therefore the coming of Jesus must be within Paul's lifetime.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.640]   If Paul really meant to teach that when he used the word "we," then what are we to
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:21.360]   make of his words in Philippians 1:20 and following where he says, "It is my eager
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.560]   expectation and hope that I will not at all be ashamed, but that with full courage, now
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   as always, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.280]   For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.600]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me, yet which I shall choose, life
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.200]   or death, I can't tell.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.800]   I'm hard-pressed between the two.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.760]   My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:55.280]   That does not sound like an apostle who considers it part of his teaching that he cannot die
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.040]   before the second coming.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.120]   No way.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.920]   So I think when Paul says "we who are alive at the Lord's coming," he's simply referring
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.840]   to those who are alive at the Lord's coming, and he's including himself in that, in hope,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:19.160]   in possible expectation, in general, but not with an intent to teach that Jesus therefore
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.400]   cannot come before he dies.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.160]   So those are my five pointers.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.480]   But my main suggestion—and the pointers are just that, that's all they are—my main
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:43.040]   suggestion for Ron is that he be very slow to assume that the apostles and Jesus himself
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.600]   show themselves to be false prophets because of a quick and superficial reading of the
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   New Testament.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   Be patient and be careful.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.040]   There are answers to these seemingly problem texts.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   Very helpful.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.120]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for the question, Roy.

[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.180]   Scripture all by herself on a particular topic.
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.360]   So what are some tips and helps for navigating the Bible topically to make our own discoveries
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.120]   in Scripture?
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.760]   That is on the table Friday.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
