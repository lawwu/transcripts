[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Is it sinful to watch sin on a screen?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.400]   This is a huge discussion ignited by a very specific question from a young man, a regular
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.280]   podcast listener, who writes in to say this.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.280]   "Hello Pastor John, I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.980]   Thank you for your lifelong commitment to the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.400]   My question is about the sin of taking God's name in vain, of saying "OMG" but really saying
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   it.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.700]   Interpreting the third commandment and applying it brought a lot of conflict to my childhood
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700]   with my father.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.020]   He and I both agreed it is always sinful for each of us to take the Lord's name in vain.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.600]   Where we disagreed and still do is whether or not the taking of the Lord's name in vain
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.980]   disqualifies a movie, television show, music track, or any other entertainment from the
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.740]   diet of the Christian.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.740]   This would of course have major ramifications.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.940]   As a teen I often said my father was being legalistic here on his wide application of
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.940]   the third commandment to media.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.180]   I have said the display of this sin was not an endorsement of it by the viewer.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.260]   This remains a sore spot in our relationship today.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.100]   So my question is whether you think it is sinful to consume media that happens to include
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.340]   God's name being taken in vain."
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.260]   This train left the station 60 years ago.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.700]   And he's roaring down the track about 250 miles an hour.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:41.240]   And I don't mean simply the obvious fact that movies and TV shows long ago forsook the God
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.700]   of the Ten Commandments and the God of the New Testament who didn't just say "don't
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.380]   take the Lord's name in vain."
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.980]   He also said, "Let there be no filthiness, nor foolish talk, nor crude joking which are
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.300]   out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving."
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.860]   And he said—that was Ephesians 5:4—and he said, "Let no corrupting talk come out
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.620]   of your mouths, but only such as is good for up-building, as fits the occasion, that it
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.700]   may minister grace to those who hear."
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   Ephesians 4:29.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.660]   And the standard is way, way higher than "don't take the name of the Lord in vain."
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.420]   And Colossians 3:8—that was 429—Ephesians 4:29, here's Colossians 3:8, "Put away
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.300]   obscene talk from your mouth."
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.900]   So that train, that train left the station.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.780]   I'm talking about not just that the train of forsaking such a God left the station,
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.020]   I'm talking about the fact that people, Christians, are on the train.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.060]   Most Christians today are on the train.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.140]   Every screen, it seems, is now playing in every corner of every car, and everybody's
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.180]   watching the car, this train.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180]   Everybody's watching.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.180]   Why?
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.860]   Because they're on the train.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.620]   That's what you do on the train.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.500]   We have computers, we have TVs, we have cable, we have big flat screens on the wall.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.440]   That's what they're for.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   What else can you do?
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.580]   You're on the train.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:26.660]   So I don't have any illusion that what I say here will have much effect on the train
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.140]   and what you do on the train.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:38.460]   My modest hope is that a few people might be moved to consider being crazy and countercultural
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:47.140]   enough to think that a great life of joy and fruitfulness is possible without being on
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.480]   the train.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.260]   Of course, the short answer to the question is that it is not a sin to hear God's name
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.580]   taken in vain.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:08.700]   God hears it a billion times a day and sees every sin committed on the planet—the most
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.420]   outrageous, gross, unjust, wicked, defiled—He sees them all.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.380]   And God never sins in seeing them.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.600]   Jesus heard the Lord's name taken in vain.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.100]   They called Him a demon.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.700]   That's not the issue.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.260]   That's just not the issue.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.820]   The enjoyment of being entertained by sin is the issue.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.140]   The enjoyment of being entertained by sin is the issue.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.260]   I'll say it again.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.180]   The enjoyment of being entertained by sin is the issue.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.940]   Whether it's the sin of taking the Lord's name in vain or the sin of cocky, self-exalting
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.780]   arrogance, which seems to permeate everything, or the sin of lust and fornication and adultery
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.540]   and indecency and immodesty, which is virtually ubiquitous, or the sin of distortions of womanhood
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.020]   and manhood, or the sins of disrespecting parents, or the sins of drunkenness, or the
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.820]   sins of desiring to be rich, which Paul said we ought not to do, or the sins of dishonesty,
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.140]   or the sins of slandering with stereotypes, or the sins of simply profoundly ubiquitously
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.940]   ignoring and thus not glorifying or thanking God.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:41.180]   Whatever the sins, the issue is, what does it say about our souls that we enjoy being
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.940]   entertained by them?
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.240]   If you say, "Well, I'm not being entertained by—I'm not enjoying being entertained
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.620]   by the sins of the story.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.260]   They grieve me.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:04.540]   But by other aspects of truth or excellence in the story and the way the story is presented,
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.540]   I would say, 'Well, I'm certainly glad about that.'
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:19.460]   And then I would say, 'You are an amazing person with capacities for purity and holiness
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.860]   far greater than mine.'"
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:33.540]   If you can over and over again be entertained by, in your relaxed, amused, pleased state,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:41.180]   by the enacting of sins that are not treated as sins—they're glorified, they're not
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:50.220]   treated as sins in the shows—but as acceptable and often preferable to righteousness, while
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:58.060]   not being defiled or shaped by those sins, you are an amazing person.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.640]   I could wish for such holiness.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.340]   But for most of us, it's just not going to work like that.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:15.140]   If when we are tired and want to unwind from a good day's work, we settle in with some
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:23.060]   series or movie that we hope will be minimally offensive or crass or obscene, and then we're
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:31.380]   drawn into a suspenseful or interesting plot, and then scene after scene portrays a God-ignoring
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:45.100]   man-exalting, sin-condoning, sex-distorting, marriage-weakening, maleness-mocking, femaleness-trivializing,
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:52.980]   righteousness-ridiculing, arrogance-admiring worldview, we, we ordinary struggling saints
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.740]   who long for purity of heart and holiness and all the fruits of the Holy Spirit, we
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:07.420]   simply won't be able not to be entertained by sin and shaped in our minds and hearts
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.260]   by that very entertaining worldview.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:19.700]   So God bless you if you are growing in holiness and purity of heart and mind and manner and
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.380]   mouth, and if you are being helped to love God and feel an urgency for the salvation
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.700]   of the lost, and if you are being taken deeper into prayer and into loving service to your
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.900]   church, and if you are being made more bold and more strong to stand against the destructive
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:45.560]   tides of our culture, and if the desire for God's Word is rising with greater passion
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.580]   because of your regular enjoyment of sin-soaked movies because you are not entertained by
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.500]   that, then carry on.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.180]   But try to understand that for some of us who know the difference between the pursuit
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:07.340]   of grace-based holiness and legalism—in other words, your dad may not just be operating
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.700]   out of legalism—for those of us who really do know the difference between grace-based
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:19.620]   holiness and legalism, try to understand that we find that approach to entertainment and
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.400]   zeal for God a path that doesn't work for us.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:33.760]   Our zeal for God and the gospel and gospel holiness just doesn't grow that way.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.660]   Maybe my answer to the question has been frustrating.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:46.340]   I understand that, because what our friend asked was, "Is it sinful to consume media
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.940]   where God's name is taken in vain?"
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.660]   And my answer has been, "Take heed that you not be consumed."
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.660]   Powerful.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.300]   There's a ton to think about here, Pastor John.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   Thank you.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.040]   And thank you for listening along.

[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.540]   Big regrets, small regrets, medium regrets.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.660]   We all have regrets of various sizes.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.660]   So what do we do with them?
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.660]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.660]   I'll see you on Monday.
