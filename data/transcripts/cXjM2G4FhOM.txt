[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.520]   In episode 97, we focused on cussing.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.040]   And it was one of the most played episodes of 2013,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.720]   over 30,000 plays to date.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.840]   Cussing is a big issue in life and increasingly in the church.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.780]   And recently, Philip Yancey, a best-selling author,
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.640]   read several memoirs and nonfiction books
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.600]   written by authors he called hipster Christians.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.980]   And at the end of his experiment,
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.600]   he said the common essential ingredient in all of the books
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.040]   he read by those so-called Christian hipsters
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.080]   is the presence of cussing, words forbidden by the FCC
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.280]   from being broadcast on network television.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.640]   This is not new, of course.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.960]   Just back in 2009, Derek Webb released a song
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   about the AIDS epidemic with the S-word in it.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.880]   It was bait to get Christians angry about the cuss word.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.560]   So the conversation could get spun around to ask, well,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.080]   what makes you more angry, a four-letter word
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.240]   from a Christian artist or 50,000 people
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.560]   dying of AIDS every day?
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.400]   Now, AIDS is obviously a massive tragedy today.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.200]   But the language raises a legitimate question.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.280]   Pastor John, as someone who aims to provoke people
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.080]   with strong language yourself, is it ever appropriate
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.080]   for a Christian to use cuss words in sermons, books, music
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.520]   albums, or online, or anywhere in order
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.960]   to provoke others towards what appears
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.640]   to be a noble and good ends?
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.080]   And maybe first I'll ask this.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.160]   Is this a new phenomenon in the church?
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.840]   Well, it's not a new technique to use
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.400]   crude or offensive language to upset an audience
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.080]   and then spank them that they are
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.280]   more upset by the language than the injustice that
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.960]   was being lamented.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.600]   So Tony Campala did this 40 years ago.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.680]   I remember it.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.200]   And I felt then, and I feel now, that it's manipulative.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.400]   I don't like it.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.460]   For those who think it's a good idea, they should ask this.
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.680]   Would you approve of addressing a crowd
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.400]   of liberal, leaning Christians by referring
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.160]   to the sinfulness of being a practicing fag or queer?
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.440]   And then when they get really furious over that language,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.320]   which they should, you say, oh, see,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.840]   you're much more worried about being politically correct
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.020]   than you are about the fact that this really is
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.640]   a sin that sends people to hell.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.440]   In other words, you turn things around,
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.000]   you realize, oh, hmm, maybe we shouldn't
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.680]   assume that provoking an audience
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.360]   with really inappropriate language
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.880]   is a good way forward.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.120]   I think, frankly, that the use of that language for those
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.720]   who struggle with homosexuality is utterly out of place
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.560]   and unnecessarily demeaning.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.320]   I would say the same thing about the S word and the F word
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.640]   in trying to provoke conservatives
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.160]   to see that they're more upset about language
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.280]   than some calamity that you happen to be talking about.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.160]   But let me step back.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.080]   I think it's going to be more helpful to just step back
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.880]   and see how does the New Testament address
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.760]   the issue of offensive language?
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.440]   Because it really does, significantly.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.800]   And here's four passages of scripture.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.480]   Number one, Ephesians 429.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.000]   And what I'm going to look for is some commonalities
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.520]   in these four texts that point us to principles of how
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.920]   to think about this.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   Ephesians 429, let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.340]   but only what is good for upbuilding
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.960]   and fits the occasion to give grace to those who hear.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.880]   Ephesians 5.4, let there be no filthiness, no foolish talk
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.680]   or crude joking, which are out of place,
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   but instead, let there be thanksgiving.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.880]   Colossians 3.8, but now you must put away all anger, wrath,
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.960]   malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.200]   Or 1 Corinthians 13.4, when Paul's talking about love,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.160]   interestingly, it says love is patient and kind.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.620]   Love does not envy or boast.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.560]   It is not arrogant or rude.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.840]   And the old King James Version does not behave itself
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.160]   unseemly.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.880]   Now, here's what's interesting about those passages.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.760]   None of them, in none of them is language condemned
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.600]   because it's against a particular law.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.320]   Notice the categories, corrupting talk, filthiness,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.560]   obscene talk, rude, or behaving itself unseemly.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.840]   If you can read Greek, every one of those phrases,
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.320]   all four of them, corrupting talk, filthiness, obscene talk,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.080]   rude, all are built on the same Greek stem,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.080]   [SPEAKING GREEK]
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.640]   And this [SPEAKING GREEK] is a root
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.280]   that isn't built on a list of acceptable words
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.480]   and unacceptable words.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.000]   Like, oh, the way we live our lives
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.520]   is there's some God-approved acceptable words
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.240]   and some God-approved unacceptable words.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   Well, there aren't.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.960]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.480]   What that phrase refers to is--
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.520]   I looked this up in the major Greek lexicon--
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.760]   behavior that flouts social and moral standards,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.960]   shamefulness, obscenity.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:39.200]   So instead, the issue is, are we transgressing or fighting
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   against certain social norms as Christians?
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.840]   And then we ask, is it good for upbuilding?
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.880]   Is it good that fits the occasion?
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.120]   Is it giving grace?
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.680]   This is the cultural norm that we should be striving for--
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.760]   upbuilding, giving grace to those who hear.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.840]   So a huge part of Christian ethics, including language,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.000]   is not derived from finding a list of God-approved words
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.360]   and God-unapproved words.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.040]   There is no such list.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.240]   Most of our behavior, including our language,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.840]   is, does it build up in faith?
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.680]   Does it build a passion for Christ?
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.960]   Does it give grace to those who hear?
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.400]   And our vocabulary is a testimony
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.600]   to this way of thinking about language.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.720]   Think of dozens of words that have
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.000]   been created and adapted to express what is fitting--
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.280]   not what's wrong, but what's fitting.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.200]   I mean, here's a list.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.120]   I just thought of a few--
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.240]   disgraceful, dishonorable, indecent, indelicate,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.200]   offensive, hurtful, unkind, dirty, salacious, scandalous,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.480]   shameful, reprehensible, impolite, crude, lewd,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.280]   licentious, unsuitable, improper.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.120]   Isn't it amazing that the English language
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.560]   has words like that in it?
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.720]   What do those words mean?
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.760]   Those words have-- those words don't have anything to do with,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.120]   oh, where's my list, you know?
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.880]   Where's my list of actions or attitudes or words
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.760]   that I can say?
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.040]   Those words aren't about lists.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   Those words are about the creation of a culture,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.720]   the maintenance of a culture.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.520]   And Christians should be striving
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.880]   to create and maintain a Christ-permeated culture.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.760]   So the question I would urge is, have you
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.840]   let the texts--
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.880]   the ones that I've referred to up there--
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.440]   have you let the texts sufficiently
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.680]   inform the kind of Christian culture
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.520]   you would like to cultivate in your children, in the church,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.000]   in the workplace?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.160]   And my guess is the people that are playing fast and loose
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.680]   with what's offensive in using obscene or offensive language
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.800]   would do well to rethink their habits.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.360]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.560]   And for more on cussing, see the popular episode
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.600]   titled "On Cussing" in the Ask Pastor John archive,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.920]   which is most easily found in the updated Ask Pastor John
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.760]   app for the iPhone and the Android.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   Be sure you've updated your app in the last month
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.080]   or so to get all of the new features.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.440]   The episode on cussing is episode 97,
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.920]   number 97 in the episodes.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.680]   Tomorrow marks the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.280]   and we will talk about the longstanding implications
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.680]   of this court ruling on the unborn.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.360]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.400]   Thanks for listening.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   [ Silence ]
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.460]   you
