[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900]   It was a big show.
[00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.880]   So let's get started with our deep dive.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.080]   Here's what I want to talk about today.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.980]   I recently read through Marcus Aurelius is meditations.
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.980]   I want to go through the ideas from this classic stoic treatise and point
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.120]   out those that I think are most relevant to our goal here of trying to figure
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.720]   out the modern concern of building a deep life in a distracted world.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.540]   So why stoicism?
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.000]   Well, let me tell you this, my, my own relationship with this philosophy is
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.060]   that it's something I've always had at the border of my radar, mainly because
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.300]   I've been friends with Ryan holiday for a long time, so I knew him throughout
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.060]   all of his career and all of his very successful efforts to popularize stoicism.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.900]   So I knew about it, but I never really dived deeply into it because if I wanted
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.660]   to categorize the philosophical foundations for the deep life ideas that
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.440]   we talk about here, they tend to come much more out of the, the sort of
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.260]   ancient Hebrew Bible tradition that then gave rise to great world religions
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.240]   like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.780]   And then later acted as the foundation for secular enlightenment philosophy.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.460]   These are these ideas that emerged in oral tradition in the late bronze age.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.500]   About humans having a infinite value that human beings themselves were
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.280]   built in the image of the divine and therefore every human had value to be
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.460]   preserved, this was an affront when these philosophies first emerged in
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.260]   the early age of human civilization.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.660]   This was an affront to the current order of absolute power by leaders who
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.840]   were ordained by God to be in charge.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.300]   This was an affront to this idea of how we should organize the world.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.300]   This idea that humans were infinitely valuable, of course, led to everything
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.700]   we now consider as modern justice movements, everything at the core of
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.780]   enlightenment, human rights, as we know it today, it all came from this idea
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.740]   that humans are infinitely valuable.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.120]   And justice is about both respecting the indelible value of the individual and
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.100]   striving towards a more messianic future.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.580]   So that's the more of the philosophical underpinnings of the deep life.
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.380]   And I didn't know a lot about Stoicism, but what I had heard about it, the
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.580]   reason why I had always kept it at somewhat of a remove is that Stoicism
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.740]   had this cooler aspect about it, where it really focused on this notion of,
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.980]   they used a Greek term, the logos, this idea that there was an order of things
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.980]   that suffused everything, all of nature.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.140]   And the Stoics would say, just be chill with it.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.340]   Why get worked up about things?
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.420]   Just go along with this natural ordained logos, this flow of things.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.780]   And, you know, the concern with that is, okay, this natural flow of things
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.340]   could, depending on who's defining it, also involve strict hierarchies.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.340]   It could be the natural flow of things that they're slaves.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.820]   It could be the natural flow of things that different people are quite
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.300]   different in terms of what they can contribute to the world.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.140]   So it was at odds with this, uh, the, this ancient concept
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.380]   coming out of the Hebrew Bible.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.580]   So that's why I'd always sort of like, eh, well, Stoicism is different.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.380]   But then I read meditations because, you know, people are really into Stoicism.
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.260]   And what I learned is that critique of Stoicism though has some
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.900]   validity is being dismissive because when you read Stoicism, you see the
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.300]   reason why it is resonating with people is because it has deep
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.900]   psychological truths embedded into it.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.460]   It has a nuanced, subtle way of looking at the way the human mind
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.860]   operates that people today recognize.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.820]   Yeah, they were, this is right.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.540]   At least the, the critique of how we think and the way our mind creates
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.180]   problems and how we should deal with them.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.380]   These are ideas that, uh, also got echoed in Eastern philosophy also got
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.500]   echoed in modern philosophical movements in particular, second
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.780]   and third wave psychotherapy.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.980]   This is what I think people are keen into.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.540]   Not the stability of the logos.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.820]   And it's very important that we follow this, this logos structure, but the
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.140]   deep psychological truths that resonate because they seem like they work.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.420]   This is why Stoicism spread so much through the Roman empire during the
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.500]   period where Rome conquered the rest of the Mediterranean basin, when Rome
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.860]   conquered, uh, in particular Greece and the, the, the near East and were
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.740]   exposed to these ideas of Stoicism.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.660]   Why did that spread through the Roman empire?
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.260]   Why did it spread in Imperial Rome?
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.620]   Because they said, ah, this works.
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.660]   It's why in Rome, which is where Marcus Aurelius was, where he was emperor,
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.060]   where he wrote this book, it's why they stripped down Stoicism to get rid of a
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.980]   lot of that stuff I'm uncomfortable with and focus more on the practical.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.940]   Psychologically realistic way of thinking about how to go through life.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.780]   And so I'm re engaging with Stoicism now.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.940]   Uh, there's some good ideas there.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.740]   So what's the plan then?
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.220]   Well, I took this book.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.580]   I read meditations the other day.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.580]   It itself is divided into 12 books.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.140]   These are actually probably somewhat arbitrary.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.540]   I think the best scholarship now thinks most of the thing, ways we divide
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.620]   meditations in the books now is it just happens to be where scrolls
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.100]   ran out and a new scroll started.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.580]   So most of the books are not intentional breaks put in place by Aurelius, but
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.220]   whatever it's, it's divided into 12 books.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.460]   So what I did is I took one idea.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.780]   From each of the 12 books and meditations that I thought was most relevant to the
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.860]   discussion of the deep life and the modern fight against distraction that we
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.340]   talk about on the show that are most relevant to what we talk about here.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.460]   So we can find some useful points of connection with Stoicism.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.900]   Uh, so that's what I want to go through and do.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.100]   So I'm going to pull these quotes book by book up on the screen for those who
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.460]   are watching, instead of just listening, let's start with quote number one
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.900]   from book number one of meditations.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.540]   This is from passage number six.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.900]   And by the way, I should mention, all of these are coming from
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.940]   the Gregory Hayes translation.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.180]   This is from, I think, 2003, 2004.
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.940]   Um, it's done in a modern English vernacular, so it's a much
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.260]   more approachable translation.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.700]   This is a very popular translation.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.740]   So just so you know, this is where my exact wording is coming from.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.020]   All right.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.300]   Quote number one from book one.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.660]   It's not to waste time on nonsense, uh, not to be taken in
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.940]   by conjurers and who do artists.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.540]   I should hold on a second.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.220]   Uh,
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.900]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.660]   I'm going to clarify this.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.100]   So see at the bottom, this is a, uh, this is a little bit difficult.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.020]   Book one is different than the other books.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.620]   What's happening in book one.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.940]   So excuse my, uh, my pause here, but this is a complicated book.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.900]   What's happening in book one, which is different than the other 11 books of
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.980]   meditations is that book one, which is titled lessons in depths in book one.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.380]   Aurelius is going through a list of people he knows in his life and listing
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.420]   out what influenced me from this person.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.460]   What traits of this person do I want to remember as being important?
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.380]   So item number six that I'm quoting here are things he learned from
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.780]   Diognetus, who was, I believe a, uh, a tutor of Aurelius when he was in his
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.580]   teenage years as a Greek tutor, who probably was tutoring Aurelius in more
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.300]   of a Spartan approach to physical endurance.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.700]   So here is the points that he said, this is what I learned from this
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.460]   particular tutor from early in my life.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.220]   Not to waste time on nonsense, not to be taken in by conjurers and
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.700]   who do artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all the
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.260]   rest of it, not to be obsessed with quail fighting or other crazes like that.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.180]   So I think the specific quote is useful because there's an idea in here.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.780]   He's basically saying work on what matters.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.340]   Don't get sidetracked by shortcuts or secret systems that guarantee you
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.420]   success if you just watch this YouTube video on the 12 ways to become an
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.260]   influencer, you're going to be making a hundred thousand dollars a month.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.140]   Don't get caught in by that.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.500]   Don't get completely obsessed with lightweight distractions that do not
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.820]   help you fulfill your purpose or be useful to the world.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.660]   Do what matters.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.180]   I also want to point out that the, uh, the overarching idea of book one of
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.740]   going through people in your life and listing out what traits they
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.060]   have that resonates with you.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.220]   That's another brilliant idea that dovetails nicely with our notion of
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.180]   lifestyle centric career planning, clearly identify what resonates with you.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.580]   So you can use that as a guide to cultivating what you do going forward.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.140]   All right, let's go to book two.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.340]   This is line seven or passage seven from book two.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.420]   Do external things distract you that make time for yourself
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.620]   to learn something worthwhile.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.140]   Stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.060]   This obviously resonates with me because it's the core idea of
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.100]   my digital minimalism philosophy.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.980]   When I was working on that book and I was interviewing people about their
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.700]   discomfort with their relationship with their phones, what they focused on was
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.300]   not the content they were seeing on their phone, their issue was not.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.180]   My phone is showing me bad things.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.020]   If we could just change what's on the phone.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:23.940]   So it's good things.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.900]   I would be happy instead by far the most common explanation for why their phones
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.540]   were upsetting them was that it was keeping them away from even better activity.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.300]   It was fine.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.020]   What they were seeing on Instagram or Twitter.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.420]   The point was it was keeping them away from their kids.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.100]   It was keeping them away from learning something useful.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.700]   It was keeping them away from being a useful member of society, being a
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.060]   leader in their community, I think a really a sketch to this year.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.740]   Hey, it's Cal here.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.940]   I just wanted to mention.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.900]   If you want to have help taking action on the type of ideas we talk about in this
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.900]   show, sign up for my email newsletter.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.220]   The link is right here below in the description, two to four times a month.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.380]   I send out detailed articles about the types of ideas we discuss here.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.860]   It's the best way to stay connected.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.900]   To me and my audience's quest to live a deeper life.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.700]   So sign up below.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.580]   All right, let's move on here to book three.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:23.340]   The quote I want to give here is from passage nine, your ability to control
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.780]   your thoughts, treat with respect.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.260]   It's all that protects your mind from false perceptions, false to your nature
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.220]   and that of all rational beings.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.860]   Now, this is an idea that I've been thinking about as part of a background
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.260]   project I've been working on for a manifesto that I've been titling
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.140]   in defense of thinking.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.700]   And one of the core ideas of this proto manifesto I've been contemplating is
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:54.460]   that in 21st century society, we don't give enough respect to thoughts.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:01.580]   We don't give enough respect to how we think, what we think about, how we label
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.900]   things that happen to us or sensations that we're feeling our mind
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.060]   constructs our vision of reality.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.860]   This was a key concept that in my book, deep work I borrowed from
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.940]   Winifred Gallagher and her great treatise wrapped our APT.
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.700]   Our mind makes our world.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.020]   Our mind defines our experience of our world.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.660]   Our mind defines the impact we have on the world.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.460]   We don't care about it enough.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.060]   So what do we do instead?
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.900]   When our, when our, we don't like what's happening or we don't like what's
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   feeling, what we're feeling when we get, um, we feel anxious.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.500]   Or ashamed or guilty.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.620]   What do we do instead is we try to drown it out with pints or bites.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.420]   What I mean by that is either, you know, substances, the drown out the, the,
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   the negative sensations or digital distraction, pints or bites are really
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.940]   as to say, no, no treating yourself and your thoughts with respect.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.740]   Be very careful how you label things, how you think about your world, what's
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.100]   going on around you, what matters can make a difference.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.500]   That is the way that is the way to actually live true to your nature.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.260]   All right.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.460]   From book four, I pulled out passage number three, people try to get away
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.380]   from it all to the country, to the beach, to the mountains, you always wish you
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.820]   could to, which is idiotic, you can get away from it anytime you like by going
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.540]   within nowhere you can go is more peaceful, more free of interruptions.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.900]   Then your own soul.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.340]   So Marcus is talking about a fairy tale that I think a lot of people
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.940]   like to tell themselves today.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.860]   Which is the solution to their anxiety and their overload and their boredom.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:49.060]   They're on we, their, uh, shame with where they are in life and where they
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.500]   want to be is some sort of big radical locational change that just by radically
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.580]   changing the physical details of your situation can radically change your
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.380]   perception of yourself, your perception of the world.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.220]   Now there's issues with this, Aurelius is pointing out one particular issue in
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.780]   this quote, which is you need to be able to find peace wherever you are.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.220]   You do not need a grand change to find peace.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.700]   This is something you need to cultivate the ability to do
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.300]   regardless of your circumstances.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.500]   If you are really anxious from all your work, or you feel bad about your
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.500]   impact on the world, going to the beach is not going to change that.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.660]   Your inbox will bother you in the Bahamas as easily as it can in the suburbs.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.580]   Your discontent with your life does not disappear when you make
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.940]   it to the top of the mountain.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.380]   It sits there just as it was when you were in your office in the city.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.940]   So Aurelius is saying these fairy tales are going to keep you from solving the
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.340]   problem because you'll just say no.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.780]   Uh, one day when I make the grand change, that's when things will get better.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.100]   And either that day never comes.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.380]   So you're constantly suffering from these things or, and I think this is worse,
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.620]   the change happens and it doesn't heal you and then people get quite despondent.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.540]   We've seen that all the time.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.180]   There's another problem with this fairy tale that I'm going to add.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.500]   Um, which is the logistical details of what's overloading you
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.980]   are completely location independent.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.540]   So let's just get practical and put aside the anxiety or the
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.020]   discontent with your place in life.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.780]   The flip side of a world in which you can be more remote in your knowledge
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.660]   work is that remoteness does less to save you from what's making you
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.100]   unhappy about your knowledge work, right?
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.180]   This is a double edged sword.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.860]   Yes, it is possible now for you to move to a cabin in Vermont.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.020]   Because you can work on an internet connection, but it also makes it
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.660]   possible for everything that was making you distracted in your current
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.700]   location to follow you to Vermont.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.740]   So again, these are problems, the practical problems you have to fix as well.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.900]   So Aurelius is saying, figure out how to find peace with your mind.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.060]   Where you are, don't think that'll be solved by a radical change.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.660]   And I'm saying, figure out how to solve the logistical sources of your stress
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.940]   and anxiety in your current situation.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.540]   Don't think simply changing where you live is going to fix that either.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.300]   So he's really ahead of his time there.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.700]   All right.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.620]   Book number five.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.460]   I want to quote passage number three.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.220]   Uh, by the way, you'll see the terminology of this.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.900]   Like, look, this, this passage starts not to feel exasperated or defeated.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.380]   That's a weird start, right?
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.620]   There's no subject in the sentence.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.100]   And that's because you have to keep in mind, Meditations was not written as a
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.980]   philosophical track to be read by other people.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.700]   It was written almost certainly as reminders to Aurelius himself.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:44.820]   He's writing down notes, the self that he is going to review again and again, to
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.740]   help try to keep him on the deep track.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.940]   That's why you're going to see these unusual sentence constructions.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.380]   They make perfect sense when you think of this as something you wrote down for you
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.340]   to read, as opposed to a philosophical tract that you wanted other people to read.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.180]   So keep that in mind.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.060]   All right, let's go to this quote.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:08.140]   So this is a reminder to himself, not to feel exasperated or defeated or despondent
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.740]   because your days aren't packed with wise and moral actions, but to get back up when
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.380]   you fail to celebrate behavior like a human, however, imperfectly and fully
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.660]   embraced the pursuit that you've embarked on.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.060]   So Aurelius is pointing out a truth here, doing good stuff, living in a way that
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.140]   lets you hit that pillow proud each night is hard work and you're
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.780]   not always going to succeed.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:34.420]   What's important is getting back up and keep returning to the path
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.740]   that you know is just and right.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.100]   There's a deep philosophical and psychological truth in that.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:49.340]   I mean, coincidentally, we're recording this episode on the day after Yom Kippur,
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.660]   which of course is in large part, all about repentance or Teshuvah,
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.860]   if we're going to use the Hebrew word.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.380]   Uh, it's a huge part of this most ancient of all the wisdom traditions.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.580]   And then it carries through other wisdom traditions as well, have a
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:09.060]   really nuanced take on how to seek repentance as you fall away from the right path.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.300]   They saw it like Aurelius does here as fundamental to the human nature.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:19.660]   If you want to get some exposure to, uh, how nuanced we were in these early days
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.700]   of deep human thought and think about repentance, I would recommend read the
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.860]   book of Jonah surprisingly nuanced take on repentance.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.260]   All right, let's move on book six.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.580]   This is passage number 33 from book six.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.300]   It's normal to feel pain in your hands and feet.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.500]   If you're using your feet as feet in your hands, his hands, and for a human
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.900]   being to feel stress is normal.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.300]   If he's living a normal human life and if it's normal, how can it be bad?
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.540]   So Aurelius is saying, if you're doing what is demanded of you as a human.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.300]   So again, for the Stoics, I would be living out, you know, what logo says
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.140]   is necessary and right for you and your position in life, you're going to feel
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.020]   stress, there will be stressful things because you'll be doing some things
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.900]   that are hard, you'll be doing some things, um, that get you anxious or
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.060]   you're worried about how it's going to turn out, otherwise you're not trying
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.060]   anything big and he's saying that's okay.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.340]   That's normal.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.860]   So why label it as bad?
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.940]   It just, it's something that comes as part of what you do.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.340]   It's part of your human nature.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.220]   Now, of course, on the other hand, you have to caveat this by saying
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.980]   persistent stress can then have the opposite effect if you're overloaded
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.780]   or you've designed your life in such a way that stress is constant.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.220]   If you're like the Adam Sandler character in uncut gems, where your
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.260]   entire life is your one step away from having your arm broken and
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.700]   a Dina Menzel yelling at you.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.780]   Then that's going to hold you back from your true human nature.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.540]   So you don't want to label stress when it comes as bad, but also you don't
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.500]   want to be stressed all the time.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.740]   It's a hard balancing act, but writing all these years ago, I really
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.980]   just recognized it's important.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.900]   And I'm just imagining he was an emperor of Rome.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.060]   And there's a lot of stress that came with that job as there's difficult
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.220]   things he had to deal with, and he's reminding himself, this is me.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.740]   Filling my human nature, my role as emperor, trying to
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   take care of this country.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.900]   That's part of what I'm supposed to do.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.700]   So why is this bad?
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.420]   It's just a feeling.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.020]   All right.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.460]   Move on to book seven.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.420]   I just watched a documentary about a Dina Menzel.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.500]   Okay.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:19.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.220]   It's a hard, talented, hardworking person.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.260]   I don't know why I watched that documentary, but talk
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.300]   about slow productivity.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.940]   I mean, man, she a long, long career.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.660]   Um, not mentioned specifically in meditations though.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.100]   So let's move on book number seven.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.340]   I'm going to quote passage number 56.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.540]   Think of yourself as dead.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.180]   You have lived your life.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.620]   Now what's left and live it properly.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.740]   This is classic stoicism.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.420]   That's why I included it here.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.460]   This is one of these classic stoic exercises.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:58.100]   You imagine your death so that you have more appreciation for the life you have
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.900]   left and will resolve not to waste it again, an ancient idea, not to keep
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.260]   harping on the fact that this is the day after Yom Kippur, but as all of the,
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:12.100]   uh, uh, Jewish individuals in my audience know, this is sort of a whole point of
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.100]   Yom Kippur is you're essentially simulating death through fasting and wearing the
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:23.020]   white that traditionally was a part of the shroud you would wear and in depth.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:29.660]   Um, you're, you're simulating death as a way to try to motivate repentance and,
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.220]   and, uh, recommitment to live the life you have left.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.500]   So this is an ancient idea, classic stoic idea, but far from the
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.740]   only people that think of this.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.500]   All right.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.540]   We're making good progress here.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.740]   Book number eight, this is from passage 19.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.500]   Everything is here for a purpose from horses to vine shoots.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.620]   What's surprising about that?
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.180]   Even the sun will tell you I have a purpose and the other gods as well.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.540]   And why were you born for pleasure?
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.820]   See if that answer will stand up to questioning.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.860]   Right?
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.020]   So I'm going to release the same.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.500]   What is your purpose here?
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.180]   What is your purpose during the time you have on earth?
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.660]   You need to actually confront that question because when you do, you're
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.660]   going to see the answer is almost certainly not to be on email all day at
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.860]   work and on my phone and video games all night when I'm, when work is done.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.180]   That can't possibly be your purpose.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.380]   And so it's a push to sit back and say, why am I here?
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.580]   What good can I do?
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.220]   And here, I think this is where the logos concept is, is, is useful because it's
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.140]   saying this could be different for different people, but where you're going
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.180]   to find strife and unhappiness and discord is when you get separated from
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.220]   this purpose and try to distract yourself.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.500]   Like perhaps the Epicureans might've done, try to distract
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.940]   yourself from what's necessary.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.180]   Maybe just focus on what's fine or what's pleasure or to fall into despair and
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.140]   despondency about everything you don't like, find your purpose, pursue it.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.580]   All right.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.500]   We're making good progress here.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.460]   Book number nine.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.340]   We'll read passage 13.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.940]   "Today I escaped from anxiety or no, I discarded it because it was within me
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.140]   in my own perceptions, not outside."
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:17.580]   So in this particular translation, Aurelius predated acceptance, commitment
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.820]   therapy, otherwise known as third wave psychotherapy by 2000 years.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:26.300]   I mean, this is actually at the core of modern evidence-based treatment for
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:32.020]   anxiety, separating the physical sensations of anxiety, which let's think about it.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:32.420]   What is it?
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:37.100]   It's a, a feeling of pressure constriction right here, somewhat
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.100]   of a shallowness of breath.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.580]   That's it.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.780]   Isolating that from the mind's interpretation of the anxiety.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.860]   Uh, this is untenable.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.460]   We have to make this go away.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.980]   We have to remove the stimulus for this feeling.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.300]   Aurelius was on this 2000 years ago.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.300]   Anxiety is a perception.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.580]   It's the way you label some otherwise unremarkable physical sensations.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.420]   Anxiety is something I definitely have experience with.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.540]   That's a story for another time, but Aurelius is right.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.460]   He's onto something there.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.100]   All right.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.060]   Here's my quote from book 10.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:09.660]   Here's a long one.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.340]   This is passage 35, but it's an interesting analogy he makes here.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.020]   "A healthy pair of eyes should see everything that can be seen and not say
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.300]   no, too bright, which is a symptom of ophthalmalia.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.460]   A healthy sense of hearing or smell should be prepared for any sound or scent.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.180]   A healthy stomach should have the same reaction to all foods
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.620]   as a mill to what it grinds.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.060]   So too, a healthy mind should be prepared for anything.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.700]   The one that keeps saying, are my children all right?
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.820]   Or everyone must approve of me is like eyes that can only stand pale colors
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.460]   or teeth that can only handle mush."
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.940]   Once again, this is a really a saying.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.620]   The human condition, when you are pursuing your purpose here
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.340]   on earth has ups and downs.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.900]   Bad thing, bad events will happen.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.660]   There'll be bad sensations and perceptions that you'll have.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.060]   That's part of what you're supposed to go through.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.220]   That's part of life.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.700]   So to, to, to be able to not handle that, to say, I have to focus on
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.620]   avoiding bad events obsessively.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:12.300]   Or when bad perceptions happen, fixate on them, is to alienate yourself
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.780]   from your fundamental human nature.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.860]   It's like an eye that can't see things unless it's just the perfect conditions.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.780]   You don't need the perfect conditions to live deeply.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.140]   You don't need the perfect conditions to thrive.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.140]   Trust me, in the ancient world, they had all sorts of terrible conditions.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:32.300]   Aurelius lost most of his children at a young age, went through all sorts of
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.060]   turmoil in his term as emperor, a really bad plague came through.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.700]   He had a share of hardships.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.140]   So the idea that you need just the perfect conditions to function as a human,
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.460]   he is saying nonsense, whoever has perfect conditions, it just doesn't happen.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.420]   Two more books left.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.780]   Let's do book number 11, passage seven.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.100]   It stares you in the face.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.260]   No role is so, uh, no role is so well suited to philosophy as the one
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.260]   you happen to be in right now.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.340]   This comes back in some sense to my notion of the deep life stack.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:09.260]   You have to actually have a vision for your life, what you value and how
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.620]   systematically you're going to cultivate your life around it.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.140]   This is what he means by philosophy and intentional approach to your life.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.980]   He is saying philosophy is not abstract.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.540]   He's rejecting a lot of the concerns of the Greek Stoics that predated him.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.100]   Who were trying to infuse a more abstract philosophy through many
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.660]   different aspects of the world.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.860]   Uh, natural sciences, thinking about logic, also thinking about how to live.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.580]   And he said, how to live is what I mean by philosophy.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.740]   You have to think about it.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.820]   You have to have a philosophy or you're going to flail.
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.620]   A smaller example of this in my own work is my book, digital minimalism, where I
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.980]   said, when it comes to technology in particular, your relationship to modern
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.620]   technology, there's two groups of people.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.300]   Those who have a value-based philosophy about how they engage with
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.500]   technology and those who don't.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.100]   The philosophy group can have a healthy relationship and thrive.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.700]   The other group is going to have a hard time with philosophy, do a lot of crash
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.060]   digital detox and make their screen, you know, gray scale and ultimately
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.300]   be stressed out and not succeed.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.580]   You need philosophy.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.060]   All right.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.220]   Final quote from meditations from book 12, passage number 33, how
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.260]   the mind conducts itself.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.380]   It all depends on that.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.460]   All the rest is within its power or beyond its control, corpses and smoke.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.820]   Again, this wraps up a lot of a really assist psychological realism.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.780]   What matters is how your mind perceives the world, how your mind
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.340]   reacts to events and perceptions.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.380]   That's what matters.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.300]   Not the events themselves, not the perceptions themselves.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.780]   So a sophisticated psychological awareness that a really is, is pushing.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.180]   You need to treat your mind and how it thinks with respect
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.180]   and care and intention.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.820]   All right.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.580]   Well, to summarize clearly the ideas from stoicism are hitting a chord.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:04.820]   You know, my friend Ryan holiday is a very successful, very impactful writer.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.540]   This book, I was telling Jesse about this right before we recorded this
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:13.860]   translation of meditations, which is, it's a great translation, but it's 10 years old.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.660]   When I bought this book the other day, it was number 61 on Amazon.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.020]   So these ideas are thousands of years old.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.660]   This particular translation is over 10 years old.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.340]   It's from like 2003, 2004, I believe.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.380]   And it's one of the best-selling books in the world right now.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.500]   So clearly there's ideas that are powerful.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.780]   So again, there are some general reservations.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.420]   If we consider stoicism as a philosophy writ large, if we consider stoicism,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.580]   if you say this is going to be my sole foundation on which I'm going to build my life.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.700]   There are maybe some danger in there and just maybe some things missing.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.780]   Right.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.940]   Cause it doesn't get to that.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:58.660]   I would say spiritual realism of the more Judaic Christian tradition of the
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.220]   human of having infinite divineness.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.500]   But there's huge psychological realism.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.540]   This 2000 years ahead of its time, especially the Roman version of stoicism
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.700]   that really focuses on pragmatic approaches to life.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.540]   So I am not surprised this is doing well.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.500]   There's clearly some good connections to the deep life concept that
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.860]   we talk about here on the show.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.300]   So I enjoyed having a chance to read this.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.580]   Should pick it up.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.460]   All right, Jesse, there we go.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.180]   Stoicism.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.540]   Good summary.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.660]   So I like the quotes.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.620]   Summarize.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.660]   I mean, they're very, I was reading another translation of meditations.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.900]   A lot of the translations cause Greek is a Latin.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.540]   It could be a very formal language and a lot of the translations.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.260]   There's a lot of these and dies.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.980]   I think that's why this translation is doing well.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.700]   It's it's fantastically vernacular.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.220]   You know, it feels modern and that's really Greg Hayes.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.580]   I think his skill.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.500]   All right.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.140]   So in honor of that deep dive, the questions we're going to tackle
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.540]   today from you, my listeners.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.260]   Are more philosophical in nature about finding meaning in life.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.100]   So that should be fun.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.860]   Before we get there though, let me take a brief break to mention one of the
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.700]   A longtime sponsor of this show.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.260]   Grammarly.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.860]   So when it comes to writing, we know Grammarly is there to support
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.420]   you from beginning to end.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.260]   For over 10 years, Grammarly has been powered by AI technology.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.140]   You can trust and rely on to help you across all the places where you write most.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.820]   So on the devices you use and the apps on those devices used to
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.540]   write Grammarly can help you.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.980]   More recently, however, Grammarly has really leveraged recent
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.380]   breakthroughs in generative AI.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.260]   To really improve in a focused way.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:43.780]   Uh, the different manners in which their tool can help with your writing.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.980]   Let me be clear with about this.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.060]   One of the things you can now ask is, uh, if you're feeling stuck while writing,
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.460]   you can ask it for ideas or outlines.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:58.100]   You can say, for example, give me 10 possible taglines or a video thumbnail.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.060]   If you want to polish it, you can actually have it now help you rewrite.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.260]   Phrases you wrote.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.180]   So you write what you want to write, but say, Hey, can you say this more concisely?
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.020]   Can you say this more professionally?
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.060]   Uh, you need to get through your emails quicker.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:16.820]   You can actually say, can you summarize this email that's currently on the screen?
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.380]   And it will give you a quick summary of it.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.260]   Right?
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.500]   So, uh, this is in addition to the other stuff Grammarly has always done.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.100]   Well, of course, when you know if there's grammar mistakes, but also
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.860]   helping you with tone and style, you know, you've, this has been more recent.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.980]   Uh, you could say things like, what's the tone of this.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.140]   Can you make the tone of this writing a little more professional?
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.020]   Is this a little bit too aggressive, but now they've added these generative
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.260]   AI augmented features that really takes it to the next level.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.260]   I talk a lot about AI on the show.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.380]   And one of the things I often say is that this is how we should be thinking
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:49.740]   about Gen AI's impact is on these very focused, specific tasks where it can
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.740]   come in, take something you already do and help you do it better.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.140]   So you'll be amazed at what you can do with Grammarly now.

[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.660]   As long as we're talking about technology, let's talk about
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.140]   our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.580]   As I've said before, you need a VPN.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.100]   Why?
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:24.340]   Because people can monitor what websites and services you use.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.900]   If you're on a wireless access point at a coffee shop, anyone nearby with an
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.780]   antenna can see what websites or services you're talking to.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.420]   If you're at home, your internet service provider sees exactly what
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.340]   websites or services you're talking to.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.140]   So even if you have an encrypted connection, that just encrypts
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.660]   what you're saying to those sites.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.420]   It doesn't encrypt who you're talking to.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.020]   And so people can get that information and they do.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.780]   It's been revealed, for example, that many internet service providers
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.220]   sell information about what sites and services you use to data merchants.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.260]   So they can target you better with advertising.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.980]   This is why you need a VPN.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.220]   So what happens with a VPN?
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.020]   Instead of connecting directly to a website or server, you
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.500]   instead connect to a VPN server.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.700]   And then you tell that VPN server with an encrypted message, this
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.140]   is who I really want to talk to.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.340]   And that server talks to the site or service on your behalf, encrypts the
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.660]   answer, and then sends it back to you.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.380]   So all the guy with the antenna in the coffee shop or your internet
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:28.100]   service provider sees is that you're talking to a VPN and they learn nothing
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.860]   about what you're actually using.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.420]   So if you're going to use a VPN, I suggest using the one that I personally
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.660]   recommend, which is ExpressVPN.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.380]   They've got servers all around the world.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.340]   They've got the bandwidth.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.860]   The tool is so easy to use.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.260]   You turn it on with a click and then use your apps or web browsers like you would.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.380]   Normal.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.500]   It just happens all transparently in the background.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.020]   So check out ExpressVPN.

[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.940]   All right.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.300]   Speaking of deep, Jesse, let's do some deep questions from our listeners.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.660]   We've got some good ones today.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.580]   Yeah, we do.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.660]   A real first philosophical, you know, thread, which I love.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.540]   Let's get deep here.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:20.900]   All right.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.940]   Who do we have first?
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.380]   I were up first with John.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.660]   I'm a 31 year old English teacher.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.740]   I'm very good at what I do and I'm well respected in the community.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.780]   That said, I have a nagging feeling that I have the potential for more impact.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.500]   I fear that as long as I stay in schools, I don't have the same level of autonomy
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.260]   to build my perfect life for my family, as well as fulfill all the aspirations
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.140]   I have for myself.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.380]   What should I do?
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.420]   So I'm thinking in honor of stoicism, I'm going to, I'm going to answer
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.620]   every question by saying, imagine your own death.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:59.860]   And then I want you to play a sort of, you know, what kind of like funeral dirge.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:07.100]   Uh, and then let's have the graphics people turn my face into a skull back to my face.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.780]   10 seconds.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.580]   I contact with camera silence.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.140]   Next question.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.740]   That's, that's my idea of a stoic pod.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.300]   This is why I don't podcast about stoicism because I would, I would love
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.300]   face turning the skull graphics.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.820]   I just would want to do that all the time.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:29.220]   You should use express VPN because tomorrow you could die.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.820]   And then a skull comes across my face and come back.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.420]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.540]   Ryan does well with his stuff.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.540]   So maybe, maybe we'd be more successful.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.100]   All right.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.740]   Now, sorry, John, you have a serious question.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:40.700]   You have a serious question.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:47.420]   Um, I have not concerns, but I want to, I want to give you a, uh, let's think of this
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.380]   as a safe path forward because you're feeling, um, you say here nagging feeling
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.020]   you have the potential for more impact.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.540]   You're also talking about building the perfect life for your family.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.340]   What I don't want you to do here.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.140]   It's just make a radical change with the hope that the radical
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.420]   change itself is going to heal you.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.900]   We saw this in Marcus Aurelius, right?
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.500]   He said, Oh, everyone dreams about going to the beach or the mountains.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.860]   Uh, and you'll be fine.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.740]   And he said, this is quote unquote idiotic.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.460]   I don't know what the Latin term for idiotic is.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.100]   I'm sure it's very fancy, but he was cutting to the trace.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.580]   That's not going to solve the problem by itself.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.740]   So what I want you to do instead here.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.220]   Is really embrace lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.900]   So I want you to, uh, be more specific about this vision of
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.220]   your perfect life for your family.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.220]   Be more specific about your aspirations and what it looks like to
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.700]   be fulfilling your aspirations.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:42.260]   We want this specificity because then you can get more specific in your
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.140]   responses to this otherwise vague, but insistent urge that you feel.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.740]   And there's a lot of ways this might go.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:50.740]   Like you might realize.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:55.780]   Actually, there's a way to work with your existing job as a teacher and be very
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.940]   high impact and get great fulfillment out of that.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.540]   Maybe sand off some of the rough edges of it.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.020]   You know, okay.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.780]   I need to find a way to do this where, um, I can have more freedom in the summer
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.340]   and that's going to require a little bit more financial, whatever.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.180]   Um, and I don't want to do teach this class, but move here and not
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.220]   do the department chair position.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.580]   Like there's some finagling maybe.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.860]   And again, I'm just doing thought experiment, maybe some finagling to make
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.860]   it work, but then also lean into what you value out of it, the sort of Robin
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.180]   Williams, that poet society core to it.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.500]   And you might find that really most of the things you want for this perfect
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   life for your family are sort of orthogonal to your job and about how
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.180]   you're, you're, what you're doing in the rest of your life and how you're
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.900]   structuring the rest of your life and what you pursue, or you might find,
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.620]   Oh, I have this clear aspiration and, uh, being an English teacher
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:44.620]   doesn't get me there, but this would, this other option that makes sense.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.860]   And here's how I'd get to that other option.
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.740]   And this combined with moving here clearly gets me closer to my vision.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:53.700]   So maybe there's going to be a change there, but specificity is what I want
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.260]   to underline here, because otherwise you're going to quit and, you know,
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.820]   have some idea about doing YouTube videos on Shakespeare and you're like, it's,
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.260]   I, Mr. Beast makes a million dollars a video.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.740]   Like I can, I just have to do 1% of that and I'd be fine.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.900]   And yeah, so you get these ideas and then you, you want them to be true.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.620]   Uh, and then you move to the, you know, um, I don't know.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.580]   You're an English teacher.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.940]   I imagine you live in England, which makes no sense.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.500]   I was about to say you move the Cornwall to the coast because
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.580]   I was trying to be very British.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.220]   But, um, English teacher, this course, it's crazy.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.340]   That's just, you could, you could live anywhere, so whatever,
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.660]   but you know what I'm saying?
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.940]   You, you, you're going to end up like moving somewhere dramatic.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.300]   You can't afford and thinking your YouTube videos are going to make money.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.780]   And then your wife gets really mad at you and then everything's worse.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:46.700]   So lifestyle, center, career planning, specificity, and, uh, Vision leads
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:51.740]   to specificity and action, which leads to a much higher probability of good return.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.140]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:54.860]   Who do we have next?
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.900]   All right.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.140]   Next question's from Mike.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:01.140]   I'm a 51 year old professional screenwriter in Hollywood.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.340]   I've been doing that for the last 23 years.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.700]   I write mostly movies and some TV.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.300]   I've had a lot of success in the business along with a few disappointments, but I
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.940]   was spent the last five or six years growing increasingly frustrated with my job.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.300]   In short, I would love nothing more than to find a new career.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:22.940]   However, I'm married with two high school children and I want to find something
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.740]   that's stable and sustainable for possibly the next 10 to 15 years.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.420]   And I want to live in the same area that I'm living now, which
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.620]   is in Southern California.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:31.900]   I'm creative.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.060]   I have excellent written and verbal skills.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.460]   I'm great with pressure and deadlines, but I have no experience in any other
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.100]   business.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.620]   I feel like a recent liberal arts graduate entering the job market for the first
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.140]   time with no tangible skills, no business knowledge, no understanding of any other
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:47.740]   industry.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.300]   Can I switch jobs?
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.620]   And if so, how?
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:57.900]   Well, Mike, my number one piece of advice, imagine your own death goal graphic.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.060]   Every time I'm going to do it every time.
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.020]   You're not going to stop me.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.900]   Uh, Jesse, I actually looked up.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.940]   We have more information on Mike than we, we said on air and I won't give, I won't
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:13.060]   give any more identifying information, but I did look them up and I have seen three
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.020]   movies that he has written.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.140]   That's pretty cool.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.940]   These are successful, successful screenings.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.940]   And he's right in the middle of the strike and which is about to end.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:20.980]   Hopefully.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.380]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:21.740]   Right.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.980]   Right now he's not doing a lot of writing at all because of the WGA
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.820]   strike that's going on.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:30.540]   Um, so there's a couple, there's like a dose of realism.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.220]   I suppose I want to throw in here.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:38.220]   Uh, it's hard to, it's hard to get people to give you money and you found a way to
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.500]   get people to give you money.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.900]   Uh, that requires a huge amount of hard one skill, which is give me money for
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.020]   writing screenplays.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:51.100]   99.9% of people who do this don't get anywhere near being able to make a living
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:51.460]   off of it.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.300]   So you have the borrow a term for my book.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:53.900]   So good.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.940]   They can't ignore you.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.700]   This core foundation of career capital that was incredibly hard one.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.220]   Uh, and it does give you some big advantages, right?
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.140]   Uh, creative work done entirely autonomously.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.340]   That is so winner take all that the financial rewards of it can actually
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.420]   help you sustain your livelihood.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.500]   Uh, you know, most people have to be essentially trading their hours
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.500]   almost directly for work.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.420]   Screenwriters don't.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.100]   So we want to be very wary about discarding that career capital completely
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:27.060]   because as, again, it's very difficult to say, look, I'm, I can write well.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.780]   I want to make a good living.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.260]   People are reluctant to, uh, to give other people money.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.540]   So I want to be cautious about it.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.580]   So I think career capital is our first thing we want to keep in mind here.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:44.940]   When considering other careers, you want to maximize as much of the existing
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.860]   career capital you can in these ideas.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:52.340]   So there's a difference between going to some sort of, I don't know, media startup.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:58.740]   That, uh, directly will value your ability to write movie and
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.980]   film screenplays at a high level.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.740]   Even if you're not doing that particular activity, the fact that you can
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.380]   recognize that you can recognize good film and movie screenplays, you know,
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.260]   moving to a company that would respect and is looking for that talent.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.300]   You're going to have a lot more reward options and autonomy than if, say you
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:19.420]   said, I'm just going to become a full-time nonfiction writer, right.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.380]   Or you're going into a different career, or I just want to go work in advertising.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.980]   They look for good, you know, communication skills.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.780]   You don't have any particular skills in those fields yet.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.260]   So unless you get really lucky, you can't necessarily expect someone
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.420]   is going to give you a lot of money and or autonomy.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.180]   So career capital is important here.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.780]   The other thing that's important here, another concept from my
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.180]   book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.220]   Use money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.620]   In other words, what that means is when you're considering another option,
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.980]   you need to start almost certainly that other option on the side in a way where
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.660]   you can actually put it out there in a marketplace and see how much money people
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.900]   will give it for you, will give you for it.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.820]   Will they give you money for your startup concept?
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.540]   Will they hire you to do the service that you're offering?
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.260]   Will they buy the product or view the media that you're producing?
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.300]   You need to use that people giving you hard won money as a neutral indicator
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.140]   about the value of what it is that you want to build your next career on top of.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.420]   You can't just ask people, is this a good idea?
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.340]   They'll tell you, yes.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.140]   You can't just ask yourself, do I think this is a good idea?
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.620]   Because your mind will tell yourself the story it wants to be true.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.180]   You need to see, do people actually give me money for this?
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.220]   And that's a big idea from So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.660]   And then once the money from this becomes substantial, that you can then
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.180]   confidently extrapolate it to where you need it to be, if and only then do you
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.020]   say, OK, now I'm leaving the main thing I'm doing.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.580]   I get the advantage of being a screenwriter is that you have a lot
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.700]   of autonomy to do this.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.380]   You're not checking into an office where there's a Lumberg style boss looking
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.180]   over your shoulder, where it's very difficult to work on something on the side.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.580]   You can experiment with this quite easily.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.780]   In your particular role.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:04.420]   So I want to encourage you, yes, if you really are ready for a change and this
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.780]   is becoming dispiriting and there's a bit of a drag going on on your soul here,
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.740]   think about making a change, but keep your capital in mind.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.500]   You probably want to use money as a neutral indicator value.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.740]   This might slow down the change.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.740]   It might slow down the radical dramaticness of the change when it happens.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.700]   But it's going to be insurance against career vision disaster.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.020]   OK, let's keep rolling.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:27.700]   Who we got next?
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.660]   All right, next question is from Margo.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.140]   How do I cultivate personal ambition or a competitive drive?
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.140]   I am reasonably talented.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.620]   I went to a top graduate program and I'm recently tenured professor at an R1
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.620]   university in a STEM field.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.380]   I've recently been interested in trying to get a job at a different university,
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.780]   but I feel like right now I'm not an attractive candidate for a senior hire.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:55.140]   I'm on sabbatical next year and think it would be great to try my time to build up
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:00.260]   my build, build back up my profile, but I don't feel any inclination anymore to
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.940]   push myself and I feel like I sort of lack ambition or motivation.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.860]   Is there a research on a build on how to build ambition or competitive drive?
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.900]   Or do you have any advice on how I can pursue this goal?
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:18.180]   First of all, and I'm resisting saying think about death, so be glad about that.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:23.060]   I just want to point out this is such a reality of me and Margo sort of very
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.740]   narrow field being, you know, tenure track professors at R1 universities.
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:32.980]   Look up front, she says, I think I'm reasonably talented.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.580]   You know how hard it is to be a tenured professor at an R1 university?
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.660]   That means she or he, I don't know, this is a French spelling here, so I'm just
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.780]   going to say, I think it's a she, it's a she.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:42.940]   Okay.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.220]   I'm going to say she, um, you know how hard you have to be the top.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:51.860]   001% of anyone studying that topic in the world to be a tenured professor, but it's
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.300]   the way the system works.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.220]   As soon as you're tenured, you look around like, well, I'm
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.300]   tenured professors better.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.020]   And that one got full professor quicker.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.980]   Like there's nowhere you can go.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:06.740]   There's nowhere you can go in academia where you don't think, man, I wish I was
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.460]   good as that person over there.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:13.140]   I mean, I could have Richard Feynman standing on stage in the 1960s with his
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:18.340]   Nobel prize, I can guarantee you was thinking something at some point around
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.380]   that event along the lines of, yeah, I'm no Einstein.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:28.900]   And I can guarantee you that Einstein is saying, uh, at some point, well, you know,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:35.060]   I, uh, I revised Newtonian mechanics, but I'm no Newton, you know, so there's the,
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:35.940]   the bars are impossible.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.300]   There is no, there's no top to those bars.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.500]   So I just wanted to point that out.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:44.140]   Margo, you're top 0.001% of anyone who's ever thought about that topic and is in
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.380]   the job market right now.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.060]   So, um, you're more than reasonably talented.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.540]   All right.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.020]   So you lack a competitive drive right now.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.740]   I think what's going on is, um, two things.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:57.300]   One, your mind's not particularly jazzed by your vision.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:02.380]   So we got more detail that we didn't read on air, but one of the elements from your
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:06.700]   extended question is that you're leaving more because there's stuff you don't like
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.260]   about your current university, uh, than it is that there's a specific positive
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.300]   vision that you're pursuing.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:19.580]   It's hard to get really geared up for very difficult work when really it's just about,
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.260]   I don't like what's happening here.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.420]   Maybe it'll be better somewhere else also.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.020]   And again, I'm drawing from your, the, the longer version of your question.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.140]   You're tired.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.980]   You had a baby recently.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.220]   So you're tired and you have other things.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:37.900]   Your mind very correctly is saying this is really important because it is because you
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.060]   have a baby and human babies are born in a way that makes them much more helpless than
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.820]   other mammals at that same age.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:48.780]   And every instinct in your body is saying this should be a priority right now.
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.980]   This is why you should be, I would say, be happy.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.780]   You're a tenured professor.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:53.020]   Great.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.460]   Downshift.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.940]   Let's focus on this a little bit more for a moment.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:57.740]   Downshift.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.220]   Let's focus on this a little bit more for now.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.900]   The gear shifter goes up as easily as down later when the time comes.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.300]   So I think those two things are going on.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.460]   So yeah, you're not just, this is not, you're not, uh, it's not a problem that you're
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:15.500]   lacking a quote unquote competitive drive, uh, right now for this vision of, I want to
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.700]   move from this university to that.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:20.620]   I think it's a plan that looks good on paper, but your mind is not really excited about
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:20.780]   it.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.980]   And this is a really hard thing.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:26.220]   It's like, if you said, uh, if you're an alpinist, alpinist, you're like, I want to
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.580]   climb K2, but your heart's not really in it because you have a lot of other things going
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:29.740]   on.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.740]   You're not going to get motivation to go do that because it's incredibly difficult and
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.860]   it's deadly and dangerous.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.540]   And it has to be, you have to be all in on it.
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.860]   And until you're ready to do that, you're not going to want to try it.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.500]   So what should you do instead?
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:41.980]   I don't know.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:47.660]   I would recommend first of all, keeping in mind life is long.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.380]   I often think that days are short, life is long.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:55.420]   So, you know, I've had three different kids while being a professor on both sides of
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.220]   tenure.
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.020]   And when you're on the other side of them being young, you see this as a very short
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.140]   period, but when you're in the middle of it, you see it as, oh my God, I guess I'm no
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.940]   longer an academic.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.980]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.700]   Life is long.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.340]   Days are short.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:10.540]   I would also say, keep in mind, maybe it's a good time to go back to the deep life stack
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.220]   and work it a bit because most of the deep life stack is non-professional.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:19.260]   And this might be where you're going to get some gas back in the tank is thinking about
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.420]   the other things that are important in your life, going back and re-engaging with discipline
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:27.180]   and getting the control and all the different things, clarifying your values, having a code
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:31.900]   and rituals that support it, becoming a leader in the communities that matter from your family
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.260]   to your town, to the wider university or global communities.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.340]   These things that make humans human, get to the top level of the stack where you plan
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:44.220]   for the remarkable and maybe change an aspect of your life that's not professional into
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.340]   something more remarkable.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:50.700]   You change where you live or your house or you start some sort of program that's like
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.460]   really exciting and off the wall.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.740]   Work the stack for a bit.
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.380]   Re-find some mojo because, look, you've been focused on this since grad school.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.020]   You got the tenure.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.460]   Your mind's like, we've done this.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.060]   I really don't want to gear up again for a new academic push, and I'm tired.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:08.220]   So get the other parts of your life in order and then step back and do some lifestyle career
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:08.860]   planning.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:14.060]   And there, when you're feeling like you've got your arm around your life, you have that
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.300]   you're in the driver's seat of intention again.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.780]   You trust your efficacy, that your self-discipline is there.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.860]   And you can say, OK, what do we want to do with this professional thing?
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.700]   Do I want to reconfigure my situation here at my university?
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.340]   Do I want to move?
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.700]   OK, now how am I going to move?
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.980]   This, I'm going to focus on this to go over here.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:30.940]   You start to get creative.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.060]   You start to see avenues.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.260]   But I think what's happening now, again, is that you're just on paper.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.140]   I should go somewhere else.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.740]   It's just like myopic academic focus we all get in this career.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.020]   Let me go to a better school.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:41.820]   It's going to be better.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.380]   Oh, my God, I got to get these grants and these publications.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.820]   And, oh, my God, it's going to be so hard.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.340]   And I've been up all night with the baby.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.460]   That's just not going to fly.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   The dog's not going to hunt there.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:55.180]   All right, so be chill with the idea that you're downshifted right now.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.620]   Work the full deep life stack.
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:02.220]   And then we'll return to this question with wind behind us pushing the proverbial sail.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:06.060]   Say, now what do I really want to do with this professional aspect of my life?
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.740]   You'll be ready to answer that question then.
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.580]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:15.340]   You could even introduce some of the competitiveness into our non-professional life.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:19.580]   For instance, like for me, it would be like golf or tennis match or something like that.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.980]   Yeah, like something athletic or a hobby.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:22.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.420]   Get your spirit in order.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.300]   There's a good book about this I'll recommend.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.780]   And I don't know exactly.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:31.900]   I'm going to get the name wrong.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.140]   I think it's an MIT philosophy professor.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.140]   There's like two of those, right?
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:40.060]   Because everyone at MIT is a STEM person, except they have like one philosopher and
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.820]   one humanities professor.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.220]   But I believe his name is Kieran Sieta, C-E-I-T-Y-A.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.540]   Jesse will check this out.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.180]   But the book he wrote is called Midlife.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.420]   I've talked about it on the program before.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:59.820]   And in it, Margot, he talks about reaching tenure at MIT and exactly this drop in competitive
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:03.580]   drive, a sort of midlife crisis, so to speak.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:08.060]   It comes early for academics because tenure typically happens in your 30s.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.420]   He was in your exact same situation.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:15.500]   And he gets into his subsequent-- he embraced Aristotle in particular and the Nicomachean
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.460]   ethics, and he pulled from philosophy to sort of engage with this question of refinding
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:21.500]   meaning in midlife.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:27.100]   And again, I know you might be at an age where you say, I'm not quite midlife yet.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.580]   But academic years are like dog years.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.460]   So you can be 33, and it's like the normal person equivalent of being 47.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.700]   So check that book out.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:42.620]   Also check out perhaps The Second Mountain by David Brooks, which is, again, all about
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.420]   his similar thing.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:49.900]   Second half of life, so the first mountain is your initial professional ambition to become
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.260]   a tenured professor, to become a columnist in The New York Times, what you do with the
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.380]   second half of your life.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.700]   What's the second mountain that you pursue?
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:01.020]   That book, I think you're going to find-- you'll find a lot of value in that as well.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.820]   So it's an exciting time you're actually at, Margot.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:08.860]   This is not a problem that your mind is no longer completely geared up for, let's write
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.300]   17 papers this year.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:16.540]   Actually, you're at the precipice of something potentially transformative, and you have tenure.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.540]   So you have some flexibility to actually pursue it.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:23.980]   So this would be my Marcus Aurelius advice would be change your analysis of this current
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.300]   moment to be a very positive thing and not a negative thing.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:30.220]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.020]   What do we got?
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.180]   All right, next question's from Raphael.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:37.500]   I'm a lawyer, and in 2001, I decided I wanted to live a more meaningful life.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:42.780]   I learned to code and use this career capital to launch a bootstrap startup in my field.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:47.980]   I've been pretty successful with consistent revenue growth, and currently, I have a team
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.260]   of 15 people.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.460]   The journey was a joy in the beginning, but things have been really stressful for the
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.740]   last five years.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:57.980]   It seems that even though I'm the CEO, I can't find time to deal with the important stuff,
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.820]   and I'm always dwelling on what's urgent.
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:05.100]   How can I go about organizing my life differently so that I can deliver work that really matters
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.740]   and I stop being so on edge?
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.820]   There must be a way as I'm the CEO.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:16.060]   Well, I'm going to give you, Raphael, I'm going to give you the tactical short-term
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.820]   answer, and then I'm going to give you a bigger sort of philosophical answer to this question
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:20.300]   as well.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.380]   So starting with the more practical answer, there are some things you can do.
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:29.100]   You should think about bringing on an accomplished chief of staff.
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:31.740]   This is a useful position.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:38.700]   Tim Ferriss actually talked about this in a recent episode of his podcast with Sam Karakos
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.660]   from Level Up.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.100]   They talk about what a chief of staff does versus an assistant.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.260]   You could probably use this.
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.220]   A chief of staff can take a lot off your plate.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:50.540]   They can implement, come up with ideas and implement.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.620]   They can be the buffer between you and a lot of other types of information flows.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.180]   That might be really important for you.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.180]   You can take a lesson from George C. Marshall, chief of staff during World War II, ran the
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.100]   military for America during World War II.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:10.300]   In my book, A World Without E-mail, I talk about a report of his management style that
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.020]   was commissioned after World War II.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.140]   This was someone out of Service Academy, I believe, wrote this report.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.300]   Because here's the cool thing about Marshall.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:23.820]   He was running the US Armed Forces during the largest military buildup in the history
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.420]   of our country, if not the world.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.900]   And he would work till five and would not work past five.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.300]   He had a heart condition, his doctor said, don't work past five.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.500]   He's a disciplined guy.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.860]   He said, I'll make that happen.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:39.020]   And this paper that I talk about in A World Without E-mail gets into how did Marshall
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.220]   pull this off.
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:41.740]   There's a lot of good ideas in there.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:47.340]   Two ideas I'll mention in particular is one, he completely reorganized the War Department.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:50.940]   There was too many people that could report directly to him.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.460]   He's like, this is inefficient.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.300]   He reworked the org chart.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.580]   So there was many fewer people who reported directly to him.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.300]   Most people directed to someone who was below him.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.420]   So there's less people who could directly get his attention.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.300]   And then two, he had big demands for how you talk to him.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:11.340]   And it's a big problem that leaders have today where they say, communication is
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:11.900]   communication.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:12.860]   I want to be available.
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.380]   That means I'm agile.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.700]   That means I have my finger on the pulse of the company.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.300]   This was like the original idea pitched when e-mail was new.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:25.420]   This famous Wired article about Bill Gates getting e-mail and how he answered every
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.900]   e-mail and it was considered this revolutionary thing.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:28.540]   It doesn't work.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:32.620]   So Marshall was very careful about how you communicated to him.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:37.180]   You had to know, this is my purpose in talking to you before you would get into
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.300]   Marshall's office.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.140]   You had to give him a quick briefing.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:43.900]   You had to get right to the nub of this is where a decision needs to be made that we
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.780]   need your input.
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.460]   Here is all the relevant information.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:48.460]   And if you weren't prepared, he would kick you right out.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:53.100]   So he made other people do more work before they communicated with him.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.380]   This is not asymmetry.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:58.860]   This is about maximizing his potential impact at the head of the organization is not
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.700]   maximized if he has to sit there while you're trying to figure out while you're
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.340]   talking to him.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.340]   A couple of things I'll suggest have a new e-mail policy.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.660]   This was also suggested in a world without e-mail.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:13.820]   E-mail can be used for questions that can be answered with a single line or two.
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.100]   No back and forth.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.220]   E-mail can be used to deliver files, right?
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.620]   It's better than printing it out.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.780]   E-mail can be used for notifications or FYI.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:27.980]   It cannot be used for back and forth interactions that has to be synchronous.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.900]   And how do you prevent this from being a million meetings?
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.660]   Will you have office hours every day?
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.700]   Come to my office hours.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.340]   My door is open.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.300]   My phone is on.
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:34.860]   There's someone here.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:35.900]   Wait till they're gone.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:36.860]   Then we'll talk about it.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.700]   We're not going to do back and forth.
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.460]   I'm not going to be in an inbox all day.
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:43.740]   Your chief of staff can also get into loop here and keep a lot of things off of your
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.380]   plate.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.860]   Finally, no meetings for the first two hours of the day.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.740]   That's when you think through strategy and get the important work done.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.460]   As you said, and I'm going to quote your full message here.
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.700]   You described yourself as the freaking CEO.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:58.060]   You can make that happen as the freaking CEO.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.860]   There's a broader philosophical answer here.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.500]   However, this is more of the road not taken.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:14.940]   If you read a book I like called a company of one in this book, the key idea that's being
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:21.020]   pitched is that as you're exactly your situation, as you're growing a company and is doing well,
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.140]   the thing you're doing is in demand.
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.340]   You have two options.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.060]   One, grow.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:28.860]   Great.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.140]   It's in demand.
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:34.700]   So let's keep hiring people so we can bring in more revenue and we could become a bigger
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.820]   company.
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:40.220]   And as what's argued in this book, and I don't know why, Jesse, maybe we can look it up.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.140]   The author's name is escaping me.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.980]   Talk about midlife at the moment.
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.900]   Paul is involved, something.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.700]   I'm not sure why I can't remember his name.
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.260]   We'll look that up.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.700]   But the book is called a company of one.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.860]   Jesse will look up the name of the author.
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:53.820]   - It might be Graham.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:56.300]   - I'll look it up.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:56.620]   - Yeah.
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.100]   So there's, but what the, the- - Jarvis.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.140]   - Paul Jarvis.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:01.260]   So I was right with Paul.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:01.500]   - Yep.
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.540]   - There we go.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.860]   I actually write about him in my new book coming out in March.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:06.380]   So I'm really forgetting things.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.620]   Jarvis says there's two options as your company gets successful.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.540]   You can grow, which means you hire more people.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:15.500]   And then you can service more clients and your revenue, the overall revenue to the company
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.300]   can increase.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.620]   And this has the advantage, like, why do you do this?
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.380]   So that your company's value goes up.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:24.220]   And it gives you the possibility of now we can sell this company maybe for $20 million
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.580]   10 years down the line.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:32.300]   The other option he says is use the leverage of your company being successful and in demand
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.140]   to make your life easier.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.100]   Great.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:35.900]   I'm going to charge more.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.580]   I'm going to do less.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.100]   Great.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.900]   Now on half of the time I'm working, I can be matching my salary that I had before.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.980]   So you can, otherwise you can extract the value of what you're doing to make your life
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:52.460]   easier, or you can extract the value of what you're doing to make your company grow more.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:56.620]   But as Jarvis says, and it's borne out in your example, if you go the grow route, your
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.660]   life's going to get busier.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:05.020]   And so you have to ask, is this potential buyout in the future more valuable to me than
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:08.700]   the fact that I could be making a really good living with a much easier, more autonomous,
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.020]   flexible job than I had before?
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:16.780]   And it almost becomes a knowledge work version of that parable you hear again and again of
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:23.500]   the American business executive who goes on vacation in Mexico and he comes across a Mexican
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:27.100]   fisherman in a small village in Mexico.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.540]   And he says, "Hey, let me tell you, there's a lot of good fish out here.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.500]   You have a good fishing spot.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.100]   With my help, I could really help you grow."
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:35.340]   Right?
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:39.260]   Like we could hire some people and you could have multiple boats go out.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:44.780]   As that gets more successful, you could level up to a really large commercial boat and start
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.980]   selling to commercial contracts all around the world.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.180]   Like, "This is a great fishing spot.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.060]   You have great expertise.
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.260]   I could help this become big."
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:56.860]   And this parable, the fisherman says, "Well, why would I want to do that?"
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.340]   And he's like, "Well, it's actually like if you do this, you could eventually sell the
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.780]   company and have all this money.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.260]   And it would allow you to live in like a beautiful small town by the coast and just go out and
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:05.900]   fish each day."
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.620]   It's kind of similar, right?
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:13.660]   I mean, why do you want your $7 million share of the $20 million sale?
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.100]   As you imagine, like, it'd be great.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:19.820]   I would have more control over my time and do some work with my money and have flexibility.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.100]   But you could probably get that within six months by instead just saying, "Hey, I'm in
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:28.380]   a lot of demand, tripling my prices, cutting my hours in half, and going to learn to fish."
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:32.540]   So keep that in mind more broadly, the audience out there more broadly.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:38.380]   Paul Jarvis, Company of One, gives you an alternative response to success in a small
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.940]   company, small startup, or in your freelance skills.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:45.500]   All right, let's do one more question, Jesse, I feel it.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.700]   Last question is from Sean.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:51.500]   "How can I better handle a work setback?
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:56.780]   I'm an engineer and I've been processing a recent setback from a feature launch that
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.060]   didn't meet expectations.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:02.380]   The combination of already being mildly burnt out in this long delivery journey and the
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.220]   disappointing outcome have knocked me out of balance.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:10.780]   There's a sense of, "Meh," to both work and leisure activities that I usually engage in
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.900]   with much more zeal.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:16.300]   What have you done in your experiences and how can I bounce back?"
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.620]   Well, Sean, I would say you don't have to bounce back right away.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:28.140]   So there's this core idea that's part of my broader philosophy of slow productivity that
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:32.060]   I've been thinking about a lot because in March, I have this book, eponymous book, coming
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.660]   out on that topic.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.780]   Principle number two of slow productivity is work at a natural pace.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:43.180]   When you dive into that, what that means is, among other things, there should be, if you
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.460]   want to embrace human nature, and again, we're getting a bit of a Marcus Aurelius Meditations
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:53.500]   vibe here, the embrace logos, there should be more of a seasonality to your work.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.860]   There's periods where you're really locked in and going after something and there are
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.980]   periods where you're downshifted because you know what, you're exhausted and something
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.100]   didn't go well and your brain is burnt out and it needs a couple months.
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.420]   I don't think that's a bad thing.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:13.820]   This notion of we should always be at some sort of consistent high level of execution
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.700]   is not realistic.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:19.580]   The people who say they're doing that are either lying or they're drugging themselves
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.940]   up to try to make it happen, but human beings were not evolved this way.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.140]   Life in the Paleolithic was not at a consistent eight.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.900]   It was nines followed by lots of twos with the occasional fives.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.260]   It was up and down.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.020]   Early Neolithic was the same thing.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:36.940]   My God, we're in the fields all day in October and in January, we have nothing to do.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:41.180]   We're used to energy output being up and down.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:46.220]   We're used to the periods of extreme work versus periods of recharge.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.300]   So I say just do some of that, Sean.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:54.380]   Lean into like, yeah, I don't need a plan right now to recharge or bounce back in two
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:54.700]   days.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:59.660]   I'm just doing a little bit more of the bare minimum work, being a little bit more clever
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.700]   about my emails.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:04.380]   Let me take a month or two and be careful about when I take on the next project.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.580]   I'm going to take a couple of days off, see if anyone notices, send a couple of emails
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.380]   from the movie theater.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.900]   You know you've done that before.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.380]   And I would say don't worry about that.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.260]   Rest and recharge.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:18.140]   And then a month or two down the line, say, OK, what are we going to work on next?
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.260]   And then you cycle back up again.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.540]   I actually have a New Yorker piece about that, Jesse.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.260]   I don't remember the actual title.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.300]   It came out last year.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.900]   But basically, it's a piece.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.980]   You can find that if you just go to my New Yorker archive, calnewport.com.
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.900]   You'll see there's a link to my New Yorker archive.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.580]   Or just search Cal Newport New Yorker.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:41.900]   From last spring or last winter, I had a piece where I looked at everything we know about
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.340]   how early humans worked.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:46.300]   So we're talking about the hunter-gatherer period.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:50.860]   So what do we spend 300,000 years doing as a species with respect to work?
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.860]   And then I said, what can we learn about that for modern knowledge work?
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:59.900]   And this idea that we should have much more seasonality and intense periods followed by
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.540]   rest periods was one of the key ideas that came out of that article.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.780]   I elaborated on this a lot more in my new book as well.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.340]   All right, well, that's good.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.140]   Those are good questions.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:13.420]   I want to move on to a final segment here in a second, where as I do each month, I want
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.940]   to talk about the books I read last month.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:19.180]   First, let me briefly mention another longtime sponsor of this show.
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.860]   And that's our friends at Blinkist.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:28.380]   The Blinkist app enables you to understand the most important ideas from over 5,500 nonfiction
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:34.780]   books and podcasts by consuming 15-minute summaries called Blinks that you can either
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.540]   read or listen to straight from their app.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:46.220]   The way that Jesse and I use Blinkist and what we suggest is as a triage tool for your
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.260]   reading habit.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:52.220]   If a book seems potentially interesting, listen to or read the Blink first.
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:57.340]   Almost always, getting this 15-minute summary tells you exactly what you need to make the
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.660]   decision, should I actually buy and read this book or not?
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:03.980]   It's going to make your success rate with book purchases, so that ratio of purchase
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.340]   to completion, it's going to double or triple that success rate.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:14.780]   I think it's a critical tool that any serious reader should consider using.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.540]   So here's the good news.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:19.020]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:24.860]   Go to Blinkist.com/deep to start your seven-day free trial, and you will get 25% off a Blinkist
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.820]   premium membership.

[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:34.700]   free trial.

[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:45.340]   account.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.780]   You will get two premium subscriptions for the price of one, so you can spread the joy
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.340]   of Blinkist to a friend you know will like it.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.060]   That's Blinkist.com/deep.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.860]   Let's also talk about life insurance.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:03.820]   I mean, when else are you going to think about life insurance more than after reading
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.580]   Meditations by Marcus Aurelius?
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   Throughout this whole book, he says, "Think about your death."
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.340]   So if you read this book, as I just did, you come out of it thinking, "My God, I'm
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:13.900]   going to die.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.620]   I need more life insurance."
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:25.180]   I'm convinced that Aurelius probably had a policy genius account that he worked for
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.300]   policy genius, because this whole book makes you think about life insurance.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.900]   So why don't you have more life insurance?
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.580]   Aurelius told you to think about death.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.060]   What's going to happen to your loved ones, the people who depend on you?
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.340]   Why don't you have more life insurance?
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.580]   Because you don't know how to do it.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:41.660]   It's a task that's ambiguous, and that means it's a task you're going to procrastinate
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:41.820]   on.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:49.180]   This is where policy genius enters the scene because it makes the process of finding and
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:53.020]   obtaining good quality life insurance, affordable life insurance easy.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.780]   All right.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.900]   So even if you have a policy to work, you probably don't have enough.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:02.220]   So you want to go to policy genius, because with policy genius, you can find life insurance
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:08.780]   policies that start at just $292 per year for a million dollars of coverage.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:13.660]   Some of the options have same day approval and avoid unnecessary medical exams.
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:18.700]   Policy geniuses technology makes it easy to compare life insurance quotes for America's
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.340]   top insurers.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:22.780]   You just need a few clicks to find your lowest price.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.260]   It's for parents and caregivers and anyone else has people depend on them.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.180]   They simplify the process of getting life insurance.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.260]   You can protect the people you love.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.620]   Your loved ones deserve a financial safety net.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.540]   You deserve a smarter way to find and buy it.

[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.620]   life insurance quotes and see how much you could save.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:50.700]   Did you see the part in the Isaacson book about Musk with the life insurance and like
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:55.900]   the PayPal and how Theo was like saying, "Oh, we could have used that money."
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.420]   For people who don't know in the Musk biography, tell if I got this right, Jesse.
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:05.660]   At some point during PayPal, very young, 25 year old Elon Musk takes out like a massive
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:06.620]   life insurance.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.340]   I think it was a hundred million.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:12.060]   Like a hundred million dollar life insurance policy on his life as a way to just signal,
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:16.540]   "I'm very, very important to this company even though we're merged now and I'm not the
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.820]   sole founder."
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.340]   It's a classic move.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:23.100]   Jesse just took out $50 million in life insurance on himself.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.380]   Well, the thing was in the part of that book, he almost died because of malaria.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.980]   If I guess if you went in like a day later, he would have been dead.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.700]   It's true.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.660]   And then it turned out.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.940]   So then Peter Thiel saw that and he's like, "Oh my God."
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.900]   He was like, "Maybe it wasn't the best."
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.340]   He might have needed that money.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:37.660]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.580]   Well, I don't want to say Peter Thiel-
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.620]   They're friends now, I think, or at least they're friends after that part.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.620]   I don't want to say he gave malaria to Elon Musk.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.980]   Just saying.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:51.740]   I'm just saying, if you get a really expensive life insurance policy on yourself and then
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:57.820]   someone who would benefit from that, you get a really weird viral disease, look towards
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:01.260]   the people who would benefit from that policy.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:01.500]   All right.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.460]   Let's say a final segment.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.700]   I want to talk about the books I read in September.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:09.340]   As always, I aim to read five books per month.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.340]   So what did I read in September?
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.940]   First book, this was something I started early in my summer at Dartmouth because I was alone,
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.820]   living near a pine forest, and then I didn't finish it till later.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.540]   And that was Lincoln Child's latest thriller, Full Wolf Moon.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.260]   Yes, it is a book about werewolves.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.740]   It takes place in the Adirondacks.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:38.460]   The main character who studies cryptic beast ideas is at this Adirondacks writers retreat,
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:44.220]   and there are some grisly killings, and it looks like a werewolf is doing it.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:47.420]   Child always brings things back to naturalistic explanations, so you have to sort of piece
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.380]   together what's going on.
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:48.940]   It was pretty good.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:54.540]   Next I read, it's probably my favorite book of the month, The Underworld by Susan Casey.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:01.660]   I'm a huge Susan Casey fan, both of her writing and of the way that she left the incredibly
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:07.420]   busy corporate magazine chief editor roles that she had to move to Maui and just write
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:11.420]   these narrative nonfiction books that all have to do with the ocean.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.780]   It started slow.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.100]   The first chapter is historical.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.340]   I'm like, "Ah, maybe Susan lost her step."
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:22.060]   It's talking about these early missions, like the Challenger.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:28.300]   We're talking about 18th century expeditions, sailing ships to dredge the deeps and figure
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.460]   out how deep is the ocean and what's down there.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.460]   It's like, "Eh, historical nonfiction.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:32.940]   It's okay."
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:39.660]   Then she does what she does best, which is it comes to present tense, and she goes on
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:45.020]   adventures where she meets these interesting characters and lets you into their life and
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.540]   adventures with them.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:52.380]   She starts hanging out with, for example, this eccentric millionaire who had a custom
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:56.140]   submarine built to go to the deepest parts of all of the ocean.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.180]   She goes onto the ship and goes down in that submarine.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:03.980]   She hangs out with the Triton submarine people, and they go on these dives.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:08.060]   Once she's meeting interesting people and doing interesting things, it just becomes
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.180]   fantastically readable.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.380]   Great book.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.460]   Susan does it again.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:17.660]   Book number three, I went back and reread a book that I had first read years and years
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.180]   ago, which was Oliver Berkman's 4,000 Weeks.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.180]   I originally read that in galley form because I blurbed that book.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.380]   This would have been years ago.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:31.020]   But I didn't remember a lot of it, so I went to reread it because I thought it would be
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.860]   relevant to a new book idea I'm working on, and it held up.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:40.300]   I remembered having enjoyed it the first time, and I enjoyed it the second time as well.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:48.140]   Berkman brings a great, somewhat cynical British detachment to the ways we think about
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:51.980]   productivity and accomplishment that really struck a chord when it came out.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:54.540]   So I definitely recommend that.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:57.260]   Tim Ferriss, I think, either interviewed Berkman.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:02.540]   Actually, I think Ferriss actually read one of the chapters of the book or played one
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:05.980]   of the chapters of the book, the audio book, on his podcast.
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.740]   I think you told him about the book.
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:08.300]   I did, yeah.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:12.140]   So I told him about 4,000 Weeks, and then Tim really got into it.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:16.860]   And then I think he either had Oliver on or played a chapter of the book on his podcast.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.620]   If you want to get a little deeper on it, you can check out that Ferriss podcast.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.380]   That would have been, I don't know, last year or the year before.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:28.220]   Then I read Rethinking Fandom by Craig Calcaterra.
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:34.300]   So this is for my sports book book club that I'm in, just a bunch of dudes to get together
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.660]   and read books about sports.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:39.020]   Rethinking Fandom is interesting.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.660]   Short.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.020]   It's about all sports.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.380]   It's all sports.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:49.100]   I mean, it's a little bit, you know, it has some interesting ideas.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:52.940]   I mean, it's basically like he's a sports writer, he's a baseball writer, and he's like,
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.260]   I don't know, I think sports are kind of problematic.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.340]   And so we should be careful of being sports fans.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:00.220]   They're owned by rich people and like these rich people kind of suck.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:08.940]   And they're, and, you know, should we really be cheering for these billionaires and helping
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.500]   out their teams?
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.060]   And we should just be kind of like less excited fans.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.340]   That's basically the gist of it.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:14.620]   And there's some really good points in there.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.660]   Obviously, it's well-researched.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:20.380]   I mean, the arguments about the one that really resonated with me as a Washington Nationals
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.420]   fan was, do we really just have to accept tanking?
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:28.780]   Like fans like, yeah, we have to tank to rebuild the team, even though, of course, it's possible
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.100]   to go through a rebuild without tanking so hard if you just spent more money.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.740]   So who really benefits from this?
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:41.100]   Two aspects to tanking, the rebuilding of the farm system and getting talent up and
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.180]   doing worse matters for that.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:48.540]   But also there's the element of like, let's keep our expenses low during the rebuild period.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.820]   That's only helping the owners.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.620]   So there's this argument of like, you know, we just tolerate that.
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:56.620]   Like, yeah, of course, like the, the learner should not spend money on this baseball team
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.740]   because they're rebuilding.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.740]   So I give him, it's like, that's good for them.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.260]   Does it really good for Washington DC?
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.260]   You know, they have a team last year that went to 60 wins or less.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.860]   So that's interesting.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:12.380]   Sports book, final book, a thriller, great thriller, Alistair McClain.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:20.780]   This is 1963 ice station, zebra, a meteorological station on the ice pack near the North pole
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.700]   as this terrible fire and they're seeing out this distress call and they're sending a nuclear
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.180]   submarine.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:30.700]   The only way to get to it is to go under the ice and then break up the ice near it.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:37.020]   And so it's, they're going out there and there's more to this fire than was at first people
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.220]   suspected.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.060]   One of the cool things about this book, other than just like classic McClain, he helped
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:48.060]   invent the modern thriller and just it's, it's, you know, six thriller moments, three
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.340]   major, three minor.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.860]   He has the whole formula down.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.820]   What's cool about it is nuclear submarines were new.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:58.940]   So he's talking about all of these innovations that were new to nuclear submarines that wouldn't
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.700]   be surprising to us today.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:06.780]   But in 1963, no one had ever designed a boat before that spent more than a handful of hours
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:07.580]   underwater.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:12.780]   Some Marines pre nuclear power were on the surface that you would only go underwater
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.420]   temporarily to approach the ship and fire.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.580]   And he was talking about how different it is to have a, how do you have a boat that
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.460]   stays underwater?
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.420]   How does it navigate?
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.780]   How do you throw out the garbage?
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:26.940]   Also how big these boats were because they had to fit nuclear reactors.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.140]   So it was, it was cool.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:32.140]   I mean, I liked that part of stuff we take for granted was very new.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.820]   So it was like a techno thriller of the time.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.340]   So there you go.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:38.460]   Those were the five books, Jesse, that I read in September.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:43.660]   And that's all the time we have for today's episode.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.060]   I'd like to give a final note at the end of every episode.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:52.060]   Now, if you're listening and you like it, do a review on iTunes or subscribe.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.420]   That does matter.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:57.020]   Somehow they use that to figure out whether they show the show to someone else.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:01.740]   If you're listening and you want to watch again, it's the deep life.com/listen episode
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.460]   268, the videos will be right there.
