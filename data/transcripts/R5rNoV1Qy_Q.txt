[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   The following is a conversation between me and Michael Malice.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120]   Michael is an author, anarchist, and simpleton,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.960]   and I'm proud to call him my friend.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.120]   He makes me smile, he makes me think,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.360]   and he makes me wonder why I sound so sleepy all the time.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.960]   And now, enjoy this conversation with Michael Malice
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.880]   in the Tupac Galova language that I'm increasingly certain
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.640]   I'll never quite able to get the hang of.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.120]   Hello, comrade.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.320]   Nice to meet you.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.720]   So Animal Farm by George Orwell is one of my favorite books.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.000]   It's an allegory about, at least I think,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.680]   about the Soviet Union and the Russian Revolution of 1917.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.400]   So for people who haven't read it,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.480]   it's animals overthrow the humans and then slowly become
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.520]   as bad or worse than the humans.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.360]   So, comrade, if we lived on this farm,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.920]   in the book Animal Farm,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.320]   which animal would you most rather be?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.520]   Would it be the pigs, the horses, the donkey Benjamin,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.720]   the raven Moses, the humans, Mr. and Mrs. Jones,
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.120]   the dogs, or the sheep?
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.680]   - I'm gonna go with the Milton answer,
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.200]   which is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven, right?
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.960]   - It's better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.720]   - Yeah, so I would have to go with the pigs.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.040]   So I guess I'd be a cop.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.080]   - At the very top.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.880]   So the leader, the main pig, Napoleon versus like the--
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.280]   - Snowballing the others.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.880]   I would say it's not,
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.920]   it's sure it's an allegory about the Russian Revolution,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.960]   but I think Orwell's point was this is broader
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.360]   towards most totalitarian dictatorships.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.400]   I mean, it could very easily be read
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   as an indictment of Mussolini or Hitler
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.760]   or many of these others.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.200]   I'm a huge George Orwell fan.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.880]   One of the things that I think people on the right
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.880]   need to appreciate is the courage of many of these
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.840]   undisputably left-wing voices
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.680]   who were the strongest ones to take on totalitarianism,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.840]   totalitarian communism.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.160]   And the three I could think off the top of my head
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.120]   who are all in my top 10 heroes of all time
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   are Emma Goldman, Albert Camus, and Orwell being the third.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.400]   Something that leftists like to throw in the face
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.360]   of people on the right who constantly invoke Orwell
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   is that Orwell said,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.200]   and I don't have the exact quote off the top of my head,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.360]   but something to the effect of,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.000]   "Every word I have written should be taken
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.560]   "as a defense of democratic socialism
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.240]   "against totalitarianism."
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.920]   So people like Truman was obviously very hardcore,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.160]   in many ways, anti-communist.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   We like to parse things out, you're gonna laugh,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.320]   into binary fashions that left good, right bad,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.640]   right good, left bad.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.960]   But historically speaking,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.480]   it does not fall away into these camps
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.400]   as easily as people would like.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   And I think it is important for those of us,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.760]   it takes a lot more courage to fight the right
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.160]   from the right or to fight the left from the left,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.200]   because in a sense, a lot of your countrymen
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.960]   or your fellow travelers are gonna regard you
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.520]   as a traitor to the cause.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.000]   So every chance I get, I will sing the praises
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.720]   of these three figures among others
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.760]   who not only, even if they hadn't done what they had done,
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   just lived just amazing lives that all of us can learn from
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.720]   and admire and regard as somewhat a role model.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.680]   - What was the nature of their opposition
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   to totalitarianism?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.120]   Is it basically freedom?
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.400]   - Well-- - The value of freedom?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.680]   - Let's go through the three of them.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.920]   So Emma Goldman, she was an early anarchist figure,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.720]   we'll talk about her later, I'm sure.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.080]   She got deported from the United States
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.360]   with her partner in crime, Alexander Berkman,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   literal crime, he tried to assassinate Frick,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.640]   who was Andrew Carnegie's main man
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.800]   in the Pittsburgh Steel Mill strike.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.240]   She got deported to the Soviet Union
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.440]   and they're like, "Oh, you want socialism?"
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.640]   Because at the time, the anarchists
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.120]   were regarded as socialist.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.160]   You know, go choke on it.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.600]   And she's there and she was watching in great horror
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.560]   what was going on.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   And she actually went to Lenin's office and she goes,
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.800]   "This isn't what we're about.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.920]   "The revolution is about the individual and free speech
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.880]   "and everyone working together to further society."
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.640]   And he told her that, you know,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.560]   "Free speech is a bourgeois contrivance
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   "and regardless, you can't have these circumstances
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.720]   "in the midst of a revolution."
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.560]   And when she left the Soviet Union,
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.200]   and you know, she went to Britain.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   And at the time, before 1917,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.560]   there was a lot of discussion among socialist circles
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.680]   about what would the revolution look like, right?
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.640]   Would there be the Bakunin anarchist model?
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.200]   Would there be the Marxist model?
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.240]   Obviously, the Bolsheviks ended up winning,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.480]   but even then it wasn't obvious
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.560]   because there was the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.200]   and what people, you know,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.400]   you and I know what those words mean,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.520]   but Bolsheviks were kind of funny
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.680]   because Bolshe means bigger and Menshe means smaller.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.360]   The Mensheviks had the numbers.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.400]   It was sarcastic that they were called Mensheviks
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.080]   and the Bolsheviks were called Bolshe.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.840]   And Lenin, you know, destroyed all his foes
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.280]   in a very merciless way, obviously.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.640]   Beforehand, you know, there was the idea like,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.360]   well, all these cockamamie ideas,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.040]   we have to work together.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.240]   You know, we don't know what it's gonna look like
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   for the cause.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.640]   And as soon as he sees power, he's like, yeah, yeah,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.040]   we're not doing that kind of pluralism anymore.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.720]   This is going to be the right approach.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.920]   So she left the Soviet Union, as did Berkman.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.000]   She wrote a book that they titled,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.400]   "My Disillusionment with Russia."
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.840]   And I remember this one anecdote,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.240]   which I'm gonna discuss in a forthcoming book,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.360]   where she goes to Britain
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.600]   and the British were very red at the time.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.360]   They really had something called the Fabian Society,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.880]   which was the predecessor to the British Labor Party,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.720]   which were like, all right,
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.680]   we're going to get rid of liberalism
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.800]   and have a socialist kind of nation.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.240]   And she gave talks and there was this one time
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.200]   where she gave a talk and she started
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.520]   and there was a standing ovation.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.620]   By the time she was done, you could hear a pin drop
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.240]   because she dared to look at these people in the face,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.280]   something they'd been fighting for all their lives
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.960]   and saying, you know, we've been to the future and it works.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.160]   And she's like, guys, this is worse than the czar.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.800]   You know, people are under house arrest.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.280]   You're not allowed to have, you know,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.560]   newspapers are being shut down
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.720]   if they have heretical views, so on and so forth.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.280]   And, you know, she was just even more of a pariah
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.480]   than she had been previously.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.640]   So she is, you know, deserves huge accolades in that regard.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.040]   I brought her up and we were talking about
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.680]   with our conversation with Yaron Orwell.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.960]   I think you don't need me to explain what he has done
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.400]   and continues to do to use fiction
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   to demonstrate the horrors of a totalitarian state
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.000]   and Camus, who might be my all time, you know,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.280]   great lighthouse, so to speak,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.000]   in terms of being a man of conscience.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.560]   You know, he joined the communist party
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.720]   and for a lot of people in the States, you hear,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.360]   oh, you joined the communist party, so I need to hear.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.520]   It's all you need to, he was a communist,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.360]   all you need to know.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.480]   He joined the communist party
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.840]   because they were the main ones fighting the fascists
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.700]   in France and other locations.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.920]   And he took Nazism as did many others, of course,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.240]   very, very, very seriously.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.680]   He wasn't some committed communist,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.760]   but this was just his mechanism to take on, you know,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.440]   be part of the underground in Vichy France
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.580]   and so on and so forth.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.720]   So he had the quote, which is ascribed to him,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.920]   which is kind of a misquote.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.440]   Howard Zinn is the one who actually said it,
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.520]   that it is a job of thinking people
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.960]   not to be on the side of the executioners.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.220]   And he very much felt, if you read his speech
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.680]   when he won the Nobel Prize, I forget, it's in the 50s,
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.520]   where he goes, it's basically the job of writers
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   to keep civilization from destroying himself.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.680]   I don't think I'm ever going to be a man
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.080]   on the level of Camus and what he's accomplished,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   but I think that vision of it is the job of writers
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.800]   to be the conscience and to point out, you know,
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.640]   this is the leftism at its best,
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.840]   when you're giving voice to the voiceless.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.080]   When you have the machine of the state
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.960]   crushing and marginalizing people,
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.000]   and they might not be educated, literate,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   or have any power at all, he's the guy who's like,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.040]   you are ruining humans, these humans matter,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.080]   and I'm not going to let you look the other way
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.000]   and act like you don't know what you're doing.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.600]   - So in this time, whether we look at the time of fascism
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.720]   or we look at the fictional animal farm,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.840]   what's the heroic action then?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.240]   So Camus joined the Communist Party.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.320]   There's a bunch of different heroic actions,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.720]   some more heroic than others, not just for the,
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.960]   you know, hero's the wrong word,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.720]   in terms of like effectiveness.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.480]   What's the effective action, I guess, is what I want to ask.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.520]   As a writer, as a thinker, as somebody with a mind,
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.280]   what's the heroic action?
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   - That's a tricky question,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.960]   because a lot of times in the West,
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.240]   heroism is regarded as intertwined with martyrdom, right?
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.640]   So it's kind of this idea of like, you have to speak,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.480]   you know, Camus always talked about,
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   let justice be done till the heavens fall.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.400]   This is a common kind of motto among people with conscience
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.560]   and that you have to do the right thing,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.000]   even the consequences might not be what you like,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.400]   and I think that is a good, loose definition of heroism.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.920]   So if you meet, I'll give you one example of heroism.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.620]   This was on Twitter, and I really feel bad
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.840]   that I don't remember the guy's name.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.400]   This was the line to Auschwitz, I believe it was,
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.600]   and you know, there's the Nazi guards keeping everyone along
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.900]   and if you were, I think if you were under 12,
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.760]   they killed you or something.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.920]   There was some age limit where some kids were killed
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.120]   or some were not, there was some circumstances.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.960]   And he asked the mom how old this kid was,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.120]   and she's like, "He's 14."
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.280]   And she's like, "No, he's 12."
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.240]   And she's like, "No, he's not, he's 14."
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.920]   She goes, "He's 12."
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.260]   And she realized what this Nazi was telling her,
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.040]   even in that circumstance,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.780]   and it ended up saving the kid's life.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.780]   So I think heroism in this context is defiance
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:48.360]   and standing true to values of liberalism, humanism,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.640]   and venerating the sanctity of human life.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.200]   I think that, and I think it's also important
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.960]   to pick your battles.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.480]   I don't think if, you know, he got,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.160]   that Nazi over there got in a bullhorn and said,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.600]   "Hey, this is the rules, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.200]   That's not gonna help anyone do anything.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.080]   So I do think, you know, people a lot of times attack me
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.120]   for my anarchist views.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.280]   It's like, oh, you know, would you call the police?
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.260]   Would you use the roads?
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.860]   Would you pay your income taxes?
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.280]   You know, I got in an argument with Tim Pool
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.640]   because there was that couple, I think,
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.040]   in, what was that, Missouri or Illinois,
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.840]   when they had their guns, and they were being arrested,
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.640]   and they basically took a plea deal,
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.800]   and he said, "You should have fought."
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.640]   I go, "It's a lot easier to say you should fight,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.200]   "but we don't know what circumstance someone is under."
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.180]   And what these totalitarian regimes did very, very well
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.200]   as you know, is if you were a target
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.320]   and they can't get through to you, that's fine.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.440]   You have a family.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.000]   So you can sit there, Lex, and gird your jaw,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.560]   and you can stand up to all the torture.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.640]   Cool, what are we gonna do about your wife?
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.480]   What about your mom?
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.820]   One thing Stalin did, he made it a law
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.880]   that kids up to 14 and up could get the death penalty
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.120]   for certain crimes.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.480]   So after that, the rule was from the NKVD,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.760]   if you were interrogating someone,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.920]   they would have death warrants for the kid's child
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.320]   on the desk visible.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.160]   So I'm interrogating you, asking you to commit to,
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.960]   I'm sorry, to admit to some crime that you're not committed,
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.640]   and those piece of paper, it's Svetlana,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.860]   she's got a death warrant.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.960]   You're gonna admit to any crime you want.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.040]   So this is something Americans,
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.520]   this is even the case right now in North Korea,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.000]   which I know you had Yeonmi Park on,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.240]   it's something I talk about a lot.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.980]   Let's talk about it instead of the hypothetical,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.700]   but this is happening right now on Earth.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.940]   You can look at the map on Google.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.280]   The great leader Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea,
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.640]   said class enemies must be exterminated three generations.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.320]   So when people talk about individualism versus collectivism,
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.800]   Rick Santorum from Ascender says,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.840]   "The family is the basic unit of society."
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.040]   Unit, North Korea takes that seriously.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.280]   The family is punished as a unit.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.080]   So if someone does something wrong,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.360]   three generations have to pay the price,
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.520]   and you often don't know who it is
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.820]   that got you all in trouble.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.000]   There's not a trial.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.920]   This to Western minds is something almost incomprehensible.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.520]   - It's a lot easier to be brave when it's just your skin.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.560]   There's something when it's, yeah,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.260]   when it's your child, your loved ones,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.840]   every man becomes a coward.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.640]   - But also what bravery is there for me to write an essay
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.360]   for "The Guardian" to say I don't vote?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   There's no consequences to me.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.560]   There's no possibility of consequences to me.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.040]   This is the wonderful thing about living,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   excuse me, in a free country.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.880]   It would take a lot of courage to be in the Soviet Union
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.840]   and say, "I'm not going to vote."
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.320]   And what would that courage accomplish?
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.160]   Very little.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.840]   So I think heroism in the sense of kind of the suicidal stuff
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.400]   and taking a stance with no consequence is a bit overrated.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.200]   - There is some aspect, like the way I think about heroism
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.960]   is something like you said about the Nazi soldier,
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.760]   which is quietly, privately in your own life,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.280]   live the virtues that you want
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.080]   the rest of the world to live by.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.000]   - Yes.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.720]   - So like without, like writing about it
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.080]   is not as heroic as living it quietly.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.920]   - I'll give you a great example of this.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.360]   I sometimes give talks on networking and I tell the kids,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.040]   if you know someone's in town and it's their birthday
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.520]   with nothing to do, take them out.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.560]   And I say, I do this for selfish reasons.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.000]   And everyone laughs and I go, think about it this way.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.040]   The guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.180]   That could be you.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.120]   Like you have that capacity to be that person
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.760]   and you're making that day feel special.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.340]   They're gonna remember for a long time.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.200]   What's the cost, dinner, 30 bucks, 25 bucks?
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.960]   So it's very disturbing to me
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.280]   how often people have opportunities
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.360]   to slightly move the needle
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.800]   and make things a bit better at almost no cost.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.440]   And they just literally don't think in those terms.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.840]   And one of the things Camus talked about,
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.040]   he's often described as a existentialist,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.280]   which he did not like that term.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.020]   He regarded himself as an absurdist,
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.880]   is the idea that we're basically blank canvases.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.760]   And this isn't something that is dangerous.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.520]   This is enormous opportunity.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.560]   And you have the ability to become the kind of man or woman
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   that you admire and want to be.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.000]   You don't have to be, I don't know, George Washington
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.880]   or one of these great heroes of all time,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.160]   but everyone out there has the capacity,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.000]   capacity, excuse me, to be a hero to their kids
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.880]   or to be a hero to maybe some,
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.960]   there's nursing homes and there's old people who are lonely.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.200]   I think that you take in a dog that's on its last legs.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   These are little things.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.480]   Terry Shepard does that a lot.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.620]   I regard him as a hero.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.920]   These are, not Terry Shepard, I'm blanking on his name.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.800]   These are things that people do
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.040]   that aren't heroic in the sense of Superman,
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.920]   but that I find admirable extremely
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.560]   and I think are very underrated
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.680]   'cause these people aren't championed.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.760]   - Is this some kind of weird,
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.520]   passive-aggressive indirect way for you to tell me
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.120]   that I should take you out for your birthday on Monday?
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.280]   Is that why you gave that whole speech?
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.720]   - That wasn't it at all.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.800]   - That was a joke, Michael.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.080]   - No, it was a failed joke.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.040]   - Nevertheless.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.560]   - There was no punchline.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.840]   - Without failure, we would not have triumph.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.960]   Can we stick on the Camus absurdism versus existentialism?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.800]   - Sure.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.280]   - What do you think is the difference
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.440]   in your ideas about anarchism too?
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.200]   It seems like those are somehow intricately connected
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.080]   because existentialism is connected to freedom
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.640]   and freedom is connected to anarchism.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   - Sure, but I mean, Sartre was a defender of the Soviet Union.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.720]   He said explicitly about things like gulags,
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.800]   like even if it's true, we shouldn't talk about it.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.640]   So what people don't appreciate is how human beings
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.200]   can have contradictory ideas in their minds at the same time.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.760]   So one would think, okay, someone's a Democrat,
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.080]   they think ABC, therefore they can think DEF.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.600]   People that have all sorts of contradictions
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.640]   and it's not at all clear
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.880]   and they'll have a clean conscience
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.160]   'cause the human mind is very sophisticated
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.320]   and is capable of doing this.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.320]   So Sartre, you would think he's this radical individualist,
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.960]   this sense of ultimate freedom,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.160]   but he's defending the Soviet Union.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.400]   Camus on the other hand would probably be,
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.360]   was very much like a social Democrat.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.760]   He didn't really talk about what politics should be
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.840]   so much as it shouldn't be.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.280]   His essay, "Reflections on the Guillotine"
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.960]   is one of the great masterpieces of all time,
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.920]   an attack on the death penalty,
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.480]   not in terms of no one's evil or it's wrong
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.560]   to kill murderers, but in terms of
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   what does it do for a society?
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.400]   If you have someone who takes a person
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.280]   and locks them in a room and says,
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.200]   in two years, I'm going to murder you
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.260]   and you lock them for that.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.240]   This is not someone we regard as moral,
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.880]   we regard this as someone who's a complete monster,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.240]   but that's what the state does with the death penalty.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.040]   And he challenges us to think,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.320]   is this the kind of people we wanna be?
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.520]   And again, he's saying,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.120]   I'm not saying killing a murderer is wrong.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.560]   I'm not saying evil is wrong.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.840]   His entire career was dedicated
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.960]   to fighting the concept of evil.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.560]   But are we the kind of people
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.440]   who want to be doing these things
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.920]   that in any other context we regard as torture or depraved?
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.800]   So I'm much more of a Camus person than a Sartre person.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.960]   - He was probably against war in that same way.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.480]   So I don't, I have to admit,
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.240]   I don't know much about the political side of Camus.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.640]   - Well, and I don't think his political side
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.720]   is that interesting or relevant.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.520]   What I find, sorry to interrupt you,
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.280]   what I find fascinating about Camus
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.520]   and what I think about on a daily base from him
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.520]   is his insistence that you have to live a life
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.000]   based on conscience,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.880]   that you have to be accountable to yourself
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.440]   when you put your head on the pillow at the end of the day
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.600]   and ask yourself,
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.120]   did I live a righteous life with integrity,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.600]   true to my values?
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   Did I not needlessly cause harm to innocent people?
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.280]   You know, that kind of mindset.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.480]   Did I, if someone is weak,
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.120]   am I using that as an opportunity
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.960]   to exploit them or to harm them?
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.080]   Or do I feel a bit of sympathy or empathy for this person
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.720]   because maybe they didn't have circumstances
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.120]   that were as beneficial as other people had?
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.840]   - Well, how does that fit absurdism
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.020]   where everything is absurd, nothing has meaning?
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.240]   You know, it really borders on nihilism.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.000]   - Yeah, so he regards,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.240]   his philosophy explicitly said is a response to nihilism
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.640]   and a attack on nihilism.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   He regards cynicism as the worst value people can have
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.160]   and I agree with him 100%.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.680]   A lot of times people call me cynical online
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.520]   and I push back very, very hard
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.680]   because to be a, you know,
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.360]   I had this quote in the New Right where I said,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.040]   "I'd rather be naive than a cynic
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.140]   "because a cynic is a hopeless man
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.360]   "who projects his hopelessness to the world at large."
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.880]   Camus, this is the metaphor I use
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.600]   and I find it very inspirational.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.920]   I thought it was in his work,
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.080]   but I guess I thought if it described it to him.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.400]   There's two types of people.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.440]   You imagine you go to a mountainside
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.000]   and you see a blank canvas on an easel
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.960]   standing in front of this mountainside.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.120]   One people would be like, "Why is this blank canvas here?
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.460]   "You know, what is this?
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.760]   "What's going on here?"
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.080]   And just be confused.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.880]   Whereas the other type of person will be like,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.920]   "There's a blank canvas here in this beautiful countryside.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.580]   "What a great opportunity.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.440]   "I can paint this river, I could paint that bird,
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.640]   "I could paint my friends or myself in the background."
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.700]   Infinite choices and this is a gift
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.080]   that I have been given.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.040]   And I think that also ties very heavily
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.080]   into what I went to yeshiva as a kid,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.240]   which is Jewish school.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.640]   What we were taught incessantly how to look at life
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.880]   is this beautiful gift that God has given you
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.840]   and that God wants you to be happy.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.440]   He wants you to live to the fullest in a moral way.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.480]   I remember the first time I went into a church
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.680]   and they were asking questions about the Jewish concept,
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.880]   the afterlife, they weren't familiar with Jewish thought.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.160]   And it took me a second 'cause I didn't really have answers
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.060]   and then I remembered what we were taught,
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.100]   which is let's suppose you're at this banquet
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.980]   with the best chef on earth and the table's so heavy
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.080]   'cause you've got steaks and you've got chicken
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.640]   and you've got sushi and the wine's flowing
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.860]   and you've got your Dr. Pepper and Mr. Pibb
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.700]   and the store brand, everything you want.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.740]   And you're looking around at this amazing bounty, right?
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.840]   And then you turn to this best chef on earth
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.140]   and you're like, "Oh, so what's for dessert?"
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.140]   I mean, the offensiveness of that is just so insane.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.820]   You have this, eat the meal.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.460]   I promise you, if I could deliver this meal,
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.020]   the dessert's gonna be okay.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.000]   So this focus on the afterlife
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.740]   when we've been given this amazing gift on this earth
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.860]   is a very kind of different mindset
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.420]   from both the Jewish tradition as I'd been taught
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.500]   and the Camus mindset.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.780]   Obviously Camus was an atheist,
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.300]   didn't believe in an afterlife.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.340]   But this concept that life is meaningless,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.340]   but that means you have that opportunity to find value,
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.420]   to seek for truth, to seek for happiness.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.580]   And Camus has this quote, it's ascribed to him,
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.140]   it's like a meme, I've never found the source
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.380]   so maybe he doesn't really say it, but he says,
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.020]   "Maybe it's not about happy endings,
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.660]   maybe it's about the journey."
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.420]   And I think when you have that mindset,
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.920]   and as you and I, I think you and I both found this
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.660]   because neither of us when we were kids
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.540]   thought we'd be doing this, right?
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.980]   But now that we are really fortunate.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.900]   - Definitely this.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.740]   - Yeah.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.560]   - And definitely that.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.660]   - Yeah, but now that we're fortunate enough to do this
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.940]   and that we're blessed enough
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.300]   that there's people who find this of value and interest
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.100]   and we could pay the rent doing this,
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.020]   there's not a day that goes by
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:53.180]   where I don't think you and I think this is pretty absurd,
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.700]   but it's also pretty wonderful.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.740]   And as a consequence of us thriving,
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.180]   it also shows other people
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.820]   that happiness is possible on this earth.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.940]   And I think cynicism is the lie.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.140]   It's not just the world view,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.940]   it's a lie that happiness is not possible on this earth
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.980]   or it's only possible if you sell your soul
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.300]   and you're like a bad person, you screw other people over.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.860]   I reject that in every aspect.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.940]   You know, as you said, my birthday is coming up.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.420]   I've been feeling just a lot of really great things
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.180]   have been happening very, very recently.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.780]   So it affects me very heavily emotionally,
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.580]   especially when I see the response it gives to,
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.020]   like the kids, right?
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.740]   So it's one thing to say, this is what I'm for,
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.260]   but when you can provide proof of concept
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.780]   that what you've been advocating
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.220]   does result in positive responses.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.060]   I got a message from this kid
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.940]   who had tried to kill himself a year ago, okay?
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.580]   And then he was like, look, I found your work,
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.900]   I found some other stuff.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.620]   And now I realize I'm gonna make something of myself.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.340]   I was born in a meth house,
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.140]   whatever 19, 20 years old, I should be in the garbage,
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.940]   but I'm gonna try to be a standup
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.420]   because I have opportunity on this earth.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   Even if he fails as a standup,
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.980]   he's still such, whatever he does, washing dishes,
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.420]   there's no shame in that.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.260]   Is it so bad to have a crappy job
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.300]   and a girlfriend who you don't really like,
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.980]   but as compared to the alternative of like,
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.500]   I'm gonna kill myself, this is heaven.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.100]   - Well, I think there's beauty to be discovered
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.420]   in all of it and all of those experiences.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.260]   - Yes.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.500]   - So, but at the same time,
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.140]   so I often think about,
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.260]   I just recently reread "The Idiot" by Dostoevsky.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.020]   I often feel like the idiot.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.580]   That's why when I say I'm an idiot,
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.220]   I often think about Prince Mishkin, that kind of idiot,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.220]   which the world sees you as naive.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.740]   I don't think he's naive, I don't think I'm naive,
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.220]   but I tend to see the good in people
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.460]   and the good in every moment.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.380]   And the world often is cynical.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.060]   And in fact, especially in what we do,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.340]   often the intellectual is supposed to be cynical.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:09.060]   - This is very much an urban elite educated mindset
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.300]   where if you write a book about someone who's,
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.460]   let's suppose a drug addict or a prostitute,
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.580]   that has heft and that's valid.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.240]   But if you're writing a book about like a love story,
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.260]   you know, two people fall in love
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.020]   and they're in roller coasters or carousels,
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.060]   that's less legitimate.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:23.980]   I hate that.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.700]   I hate that, I hate that so much
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.980]   because the message it gives to people
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.220]   is you have to choose between thriving and happiness
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.380]   and silliness and seriousness and depravity.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.020]   And I'm not saying that drug addicts or prostitutes
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.780]   to pray, but they're basically their worldviews.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.440]   If it's, unless it's dark and twisted,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.960]   it doesn't really count as art.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.940]   And I despise that mindset, that subtext.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.900]   - So the internet and people around me
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.860]   often will call me naive because I don't know.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.980]   - I think the word they want is innocent, don't you think?
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.780]   It's a better word. - But it's not that innocent.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.560]   - No, but innocent in that you genuinely in your heart,
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.180]   I know you fairly well at this point,
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.220]   believe that goodness is possible
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.300]   and that people can, if not be good,
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.140]   at least be better than they were yesterday.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.820]   - See, even the word naive or the word innocent
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.500]   presumes that there's not wisdom in that,
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.700]   presumes that somehow that's,
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.980]   oh, isn't that beautiful to live that life
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.260]   of a child who sees the world with these bright eyes
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.260]   and is hopeful about the future,
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.100]   but just wait until they grow up and realize
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.960]   that reality is much harsher than they think.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.120]   But that child might be wiser
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.080]   than all of the adults in the room.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.480]   - And don't you wanna be, if the world is like that,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.120]   don't you wanna be the guy who takes it on
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.040]   and changes it for the better?
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.360]   So it's like saying, well, cancer's everywhere,
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.400]   it's inevitable, well, don't you wanna be the one
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.720]   who says, not anymore, I'm here
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.080]   and I'm gonna make that change
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.160]   and I can see it being better than it is now.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.940]   So I think you and I have the same analysis
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.980]   of your worldview and I don't think
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.860]   that there is a good word for it.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.740]   So I guess it's this idea of inherent benevolence,
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.620]   might be maybe wordy, but I think that's more accurate
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.300]   because you and I did not have such easy lives
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.140]   growing up, to put it mildly.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.900]   You constantly talk about just horrific aspects of life.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.500]   So to claim that you kinda don't know that they exist
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.940]   or you sleep on the rug is completely not accurate
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.260]   to your work and your mindset.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.440]   - Can we talk about World War II and the Soviet Union?
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.280]   - Sure.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:36.640]   - So on Sunday, June 22nd, 1941,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.320]   Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa,
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.920]   which was the surprise invasion of the Soviet Union.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:48.200]   If I could read to you a few lyrics from a song
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.820]   that for some reason has stuck throughout my childhood.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.720]   It was a famous song during that time.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.300]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:19.020]   The song talks about Kiev, like that moment
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.780]   as part of that operation that Kiev was first bombed
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.460]   and it was announced on June 22nd.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.940]   The song says at exactly four o'clock
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.780]   that the war has begun.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.580]   For some reason, this song haunts me
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.740]   because the exactness of that time
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.380]   and this realization that at any moment
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.600]   you could have this thing happen to you
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.180]   in your own personal life.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.860]   Maybe you had something like 9/11 happen
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.300]   where everything changes.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.860]   And it's just like haunting
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.020]   because it makes me think that at any moment
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.700]   something like that could happen that changes everything.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.220]   And I just think about like normal life going on in Kiev
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.740]   at the time and then all of a sudden the bombs are dropping
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.620]   and they announced that the war has begun
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.500]   and you thought you were going to stay out of the war.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:26.300]   - This is something that is very intensely emotional for me
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.580]   because you and I are both Russian Jewish.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.900]   So to know that my grandparents
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.900]   and my great-grandma were told that the Nazis are coming
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.060]   and this was an address rehearsal
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.580]   and that if they get here, which they do, they did.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.740]   Lvov is very Western Ukraine,
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.100]   that 100% you and all your relatives are going to be murdered
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.980]   and there's a monument now in Lvov
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.720]   where I'm from about this,
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.720]   but I don't think either of us can imagine what it's like
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.860]   to know, to think that we're about minutes or whatever hours
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.980]   or there's just the Russian army standing between us
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.220]   and everyone we are related to
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.740]   are going to be murdered for no reason.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.740]   And you know, like what's the closure here, right?
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.940]   Like they evacuated a lot of people
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.820]   but they didn't evacuate enough.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.900]   And to know that there is this force
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.620]   coming to 100% murder you,
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.820]   this isn't some kind of, you know,
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.260]   the TV news being hyperbolic, they're coming to kill you.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.740]   And if they get you, they will kill you.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.340]   And you have to, you know, we all think about war like,
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.460]   oh, you know, we hope America wins in Iraq, right, right.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.820]   But if America got their ass kicked kind of in Vietnam,
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.820]   it's not really gonna affect America
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.660]   in the sense that you're gonna have the body bags
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.800]   and all the kids being killed.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.940]   And that's something that's, I'm not sweeping in the rug,
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.820]   but no one in America thought the Vietnamese
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.160]   are gonna come here and kill them, right?
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.780]   They were secure in their person.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.780]   So to have that sense of, we really need to win
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.700]   because if we don't win, we are 100%,
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.020]   if we, they, the Russian army doesn't win,
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.620]   we are 100% all going to be slaughtered
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.660]   and often in not just a bullet to the head
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.900]   and in sadistic ways is something that to know
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.780]   that people who share my blood saw and went through
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:44.780]   is very hard for me to kind of wrap my head around.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.820]   - And there's no possibility to delude yourself.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.740]   - Because I mean, they would, as the song also talks about,
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.540]   but they would burn the factories.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.020]   So it's basically saying we're in the war now.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.740]   This is like--
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.580]   - This is your life, yeah.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.700]   - This is our life now.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.860]   - You know how you, yesterday you were worried about like,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.380]   oh, I misplaced my pen.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.500]   Where is it like, it's like, yeah, this was paradise.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.380]   - Most of us are gonna, our life now is that most of us
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.300]   are going to die.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.580]   And if we want to prevent all of us from dying,
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.620]   we have to fight.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.740]   And we also can't sit down in some kind of weird
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.060]   like desert island or plane crash situation
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.060]   and be like, let's decide between us
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.220]   who's gonna be the first to die.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.820]   Maybe the Titanic, right?
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.820]   They sat down and they were like women and children
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.980]   in the lifeboats.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.700]   You know, they had this rational agreement.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.380]   You don't have those choices in a war.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.380]   So it's something that I, it's just very chilling
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:56.180]   and it's something I don't really have the emotional space
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.300]   to understand or grapple with.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.220]   Even, you know, obviously I've been to North Korea,
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.100]   you can see it and so on and so forth.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.060]   You and I can't, or anyone listening to this,
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.980]   except for maybe on me and people like that,
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.020]   you can't imagine what that's like to live it.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.460]   We can't, we can't imagine what it's like to live
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.780]   in those situations where it's not like before Hitler came,
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.420]   everyone's dancing around and having a great time.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.420]   I mean, imagine how, what that life is like
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.580]   where your preference to Hitler is starving
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.780]   and waiting on line for hours for bread
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.140]   and to have the secret police and your friend's attorney
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.520]   when and your phones are all tapped and you're a prisoner.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.500]   But to you, this is infinitely better than the alternative.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.540]   Like these are the choices that, you know,
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.060]   our family had to deal with.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.260]   It's something that no matter how much you,
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.900]   it's like, let me put it in terms people can understand.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.740]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.580]   It's like your first bad breakup, right?
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.380]   Like that's a much simpler thing to wrap your head around
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.460]   because it's like, if you've never had it,
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.300]   you can't really, but when you feel it,
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.540]   it's just so intense, but you can't tell someone
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.660]   what it's like.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.700]   We could sit down for days and hours
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.020]   and have people tell us, but until it's the totality
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.140]   of your environment and your life and your mindset.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.340]   I remember my grandma,
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:19.340]   she would talk about, it's like,
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:26.040]   when you're that hungry,
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:32.220]   all you're thinking about is bread.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.060]   - Yeah.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.660]   - Because your brain won't like, you know,
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.460]   human beings, you know, we evolved,
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.580]   we have instincts, whatever.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.420]   And the mind is telling you food, food, food, food, food,
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.300]   food, and that there's kids thinking this
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.820]   and that they're not gonna get the food.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.660]   - Yeah.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.940]   - And you imagine being a parent and your kids--
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.780]   - Watching your kids without food
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.340]   and knowing they're not gonna get the food.
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.940]   - And the fact that this happened in North Korea
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.020]   in the '90s, I met a refugee
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:07.320]   and he had to watch his dad starve to death.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.500]   And thank you.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.980]   And we have no concept of what it's like.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:23.140]   I mean, we kind of, you know, it's just like,
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.260]   last night here in Austin, all the places were closed
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.340]   and I couldn't get my protein powder.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.180]   - Yeah.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.760]   - And this is the extent of my suffering
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.540]   when it comes to food, you know, or if I couldn't,
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.980]   there was a restaurant that I went to in Brooklyn
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.860]   where for some fakakta reason,
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.260]   they weren't serving sashimi, they only had sushi.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.700]   So I had to have the rice and the carbs.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.220]   To live a life where that is the extent
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.320]   of your food problems, as opposed to the choice
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.140]   is either Hitler killing you or being hungry 24/7.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.620]   You know, my grandma told this story
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.660]   of how they had a close call.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.660]   It was her and her brother and her mom,
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.020]   my great-grandma, who passed.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.980]   And I think there was like either a helicopter overhead
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.260]   or something and my great-grandma jumped on top
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.700]   of my grandma's brother and not my grandma.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.060]   So she basically did a Sophie's Choice,
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.640]   my grandma's name is Sophia, and chose the brother.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.980]   And this is something that she felt, you know,
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.360]   all her life that her mom had chosen her brother over her.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.500]   But these little things that happen,
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.840]   these little kind of decisions we have to make in war,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.340]   there's a book I read called "Five Chimneys," I think,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.940]   this woman who was an Auschwitz survivor.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.620]   And what she talked about, what people don't appreciate,
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.300]   it's not necessarily the slaughter and the torture,
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.060]   it's that there's no rhyme or reason to it.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.900]   Like she talked about how they had a camp
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.340]   just for people from Czechoslovakia,
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.460]   and they were treated better than the Jews,
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.600]   and then one day they just killed them all, right?
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.260]   And she's like, I still don't understand
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.740]   why they're giving them food and treating them well,
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.500]   and then the next day they're all killed,
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.060]   and we will never get answers, you know?
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.540]   And things like, she talks about
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.380]   how they decided to kill all the kids,
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.380]   and they didn't really, either for some reason
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.980]   they didn't have the courage to,
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.380]   or they wanted to be cruel, so instead of shooting them,
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.020]   they just kept walking in the snow until they all died.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.020]   So it's things like this,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.840]   that the fact that you and I dodged these bullets,
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.380]   and that we can be here and be doing this,
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.680]   and, you know, running our mouths for a living,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.080]   I think about it all the time,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.520]   and it's just very disturbing to know,
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.260]   and I know you know this as well,
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.760]   that there's lots of places on earth
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.580]   where if people had a choice, they would kill us on sight
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.520]   and be proud of themselves for it.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.720]   - Yeah, I don't know what to make of the contrast.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.680]   You were talking about the fact that
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.240]   you've been truly happy the last few weeks and months.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.080]   - Yes.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.560]   - There's been a lot of moments of happiness
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   and joy, and that joy is built
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.880]   on a history of human suffering.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.380]   Like in your roots, in your blood,
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.100]   is a lot of people that were tortured, that suffered,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.840]   so that you could have this joy.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.680]   And you have both the, you have the responsibility
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.880]   to truly be grateful for that joy.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.120]   - But it also shows that there's the happy ending,
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.920]   that it does end in a good note,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.720]   that it does get infinitely, infinitely better,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.440]   and that I think there's a,
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.280]   I don't like using the word responsibility,
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.320]   but there is an opportunity for those of us
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   who did dodge that bullet to give testimony to these people,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.600]   and more importantly, to give testimony to the people
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.120]   who are going through this now.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.840]   So, one of the reasons I talk about North Korea so much,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.520]   why I wrote Dear Reader, is because it's very easy,
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.120]   and this is human nature, I'm not condemning people.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.480]   I don't, I think that's just how people are wired.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.160]   When you see an Asian country with Asian people,
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   and things are bad over there,
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.760]   I think in the West, it's like, oh, Asia,
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.120]   they're all crazy, they're wacky,
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.240]   they eat dogs, or so on and so forth,
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.200]   some weird stereotype,
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.720]   and they think of them as kind of Martians.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.120]   So, it's important for people who aren't
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.800]   of that kind of ancestry to speak on behalf of these people,
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.640]   because it's very different how just people
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.720]   just naturally react when you have a Westerner
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.000]   talking about this.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.840]   Instead of it becoming them over there,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.760]   it becomes, this could have been us very easily.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   I have a friend, Peter Veyhansky, great dude,
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.200]   and I was showing him photos when I was in Pyongyang,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.520]   and he goes, this looks like a Russian city
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.360]   with Asian people.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.440]   It completely disturbed him.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.400]   So, that was one of the reasons I did go to North Korea,
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.320]   'cause that was as close as I would get
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.800]   to see what your family went through,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.560]   to see what my family went through,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.520]   and they're still living under this regime.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.920]   And one of the things I fought very hard to do
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.480]   with Dear Reader, which I was successful in amazingly,
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.960]   and it just, I said, I could die now.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.120]   I feel like if you just move the needle a little bit,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.560]   then you've kind of paid your due
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.080]   for your time here on this earth.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.480]   To have it change from being a laughing stock,
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.160]   and I think Team America did a good job.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.240]   They made Kim Jong-il into a clown,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.600]   and they made a joke of it,
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.920]   but you're going from nothing to jokes.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.960]   At least now people are aware of it, that it exists, right?
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.920]   And then I, and many others, took it from a joke to like,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.880]   guys, this is really, really, really bad,
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.440]   and none of us can even appreciate how bad it is,
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.520]   and I think now there is an understanding,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.080]   other than a few people who are just looking at it
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.880]   through a Trump lens and wanting Trump to fail,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.520]   'cause Trump's an asshole and that's fine,
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.040]   to be like these poor people.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.200]   And it's really unfortunate,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.400]   because there's a segment of Western culture
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.840]   who thinks that, correctly,
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.480]   often when you're complaining about,
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.880]   or discussing the plight of another country,
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.040]   that's just your prelude to war and an excuse to invade.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.120]   Like the Kurds in Syria, we're talking about,
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.320]   if we don't end Syria tomorrow,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.400]   it's gonna be another genocide, blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.560]   I'm not saying let's invade North Korea,
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.400]   or anything like that.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.400]   All I'm saying is, thank God that this isn't your life.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.920]   I bring this up all the time.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.720]   The woman who was my guide when I was there,
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.160]   I'm aware of what she's up to now.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.360]   She's extremely rich by North Korean standards,
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.520]   but she'll never be in a position to buy medicine.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.320]   She'll never be in a position to go on a vacation.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.400]   Things that you and I just, whatever,
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.360]   she can't go on the internet.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.160]   She can't get an encyclopedia.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.400]   She can't better herself as a person,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.600]   other than through what the state allows,
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.480]   and meaning better yourself as a person
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.080]   in service to the state.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.960]   So, I mean, it's also frustrating,
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.280]   'cause there's only so much that I can do as an individual.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.600]   - What's your takeaway about human nature,
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.080]   from looking at North Korea,
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.240]   and looking at how the rest of the world
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.560]   is looking at North Korea?
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.760]   - This is a great question.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.440]   I think about it fairly often.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.960]   I always say human beings are animals, right?
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.360]   When you say someone's an animal,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.000]   it's like a slur, like he's a beast.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Animals are capable of enormous kindness,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.120]   empathy, sympathy.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.800]   They look out for one another, groom one another.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.200]   There's a thing with apes,
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.680]   where they groom each other for parasites,
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.400]   and even if there are no parasites,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.640]   they pretend there's parasites,
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.520]   just to have that kind of bonding.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.440]   You see infinite photos online of cats raising puppies,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.720]   'cause the puppy's mom died, things like this.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.200]   That's part of being an animal.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.040]   Part of being an animal is also
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.360]   just the most monstrous cruelty, killer whales.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.280]   There's this big PC move to not call them killer whales,
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.640]   and just call them orcas.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   They will murder blue whale pups, calves, excuse me,
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.400]   and play with them and not even eat them.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   So they just murder for the sake of fun.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.720]   And cats kill birds all the time, things like this.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.440]   So it runs the whole gamut.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.160]   When Yaron and I run your show,
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.760]   I don't think "Lord of the Flies" is accurate.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.920]   I don't think Hobbes is how reality works
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.040]   when you're in that kind of state.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:19.040]   But I think we've seen countless examples of human beings,
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.640]   especially when human beings have power
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.720]   over someone who's powerless,
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.440]   of allowing themselves to engage in not just harm,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.160]   but cruelty.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.960]   And that is something as Soviets,
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.520]   you and I are very painfully aware of.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.740]   It's not just about the oppression,
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.540]   which as bad enough as it is,
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.720]   it's that mediocre person with that little bit of power,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.120]   and now they're standing between you
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.160]   and your daughter having medicine,
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.600]   and they love it to make you dance,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.160]   to be like, "Oh, you need me to get this medicine?"
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.080]   Make you go through hoops,
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.320]   'cause now they feel like for the first time in their life,
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.240]   they're in a position of strength and power.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.440]   I think that is in many ways the more common nature of evil,
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.960]   that what Hannah Arendt talks about, the banality of evil,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.800]   than someone who's like an SS guard
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.240]   just shooting someone in the head.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.120]   Like that, I think we could all wrap our heads around
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.640]   to some extent, like, "Okay, I'm a military.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.480]   "It's not easy.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.840]   "I have to execute people."
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.080]   Pulling a trigger, you could kind of have
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.800]   this mental disconnect between the finger and the victim.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.660]   But like that little day-to-day stuff,
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.780]   like are you doing the right thing on a day-to-day basis?
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.800]   That I think is far more common
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.620]   and far more disturbing aspect in certain senses
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.660]   of the human psyche.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:35.620]   - Yeah, there's something especially disturbing
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:40.620]   about a weak man given power,
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.320]   and just abusing that power.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.960]   There's something about not just weak,
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.160]   but like mediocre at everything he does,
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.640]   or less than mediocre.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.000]   - A great example of this,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.480]   which I'm also talking about in the next book,
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.360]   is Ceausescu, who was the dictator of Romania.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.480]   So the Cold War is still somewhat poorly understood
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.880]   in popular culture, but the different countries
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.980]   in the Second World, the Soviet bloc,
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.560]   some are more liberal than others.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.800]   Some are more sane than others.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.080]   And Ceausescu, at first, was one of the more
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.900]   Western-friendly, more the free ones.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.660]   Then he met the great leader, Kim Il-sung, from North Korea,
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:20.240]   and he had the idea to impose a personality cult on Romania.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.480]   And it's the kind of things like forcing people to breed,
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   'cause he wanted to make people taller.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.120]   I think he made like the biggest building in all of Europe,
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.400]   the People's Palace, but it was just for him,
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.840]   while there's no electricity elsewhere.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.660]   But you look at this guy, Stalin's a badass, right?
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.640]   He was a bank robber.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.800]   If you look at photos of him as a kid, he was a hunk.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.640]   Lenin was clearly intellectual.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.360]   These were powerful, Trotsky, these were powerful men
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.040]   with huge egos, huge force of personality.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.000]   But you look at this Ceausescu guy, and you could,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   like for example, on my driver's license,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.700]   instead of my address, I'm like in my real address,
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.560]   being like one, two, three, four, Fifth Avenue,
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.720]   by mistake it says one, two, three, four, Fifth Street.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.200]   So you can imagine him being in the post office
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.120]   and me giving him my ID to get my package
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.320]   and him being baffled because this says street,
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.080]   this says Avenue instead of understand.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.880]   And the look on his face, this dullard,
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.720]   that you can see how, you know how sometimes,
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.880]   I'm gonna, can I curse?
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.800]   - Fuck yes.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.280]   - Yeah, so if you know like how if you're in the airport
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.200]   and you see someone and you look at them an adult
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.160]   and you think, okay, this person was born fucked up,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.800]   just like on sight, like something's wrong with them,
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.000]   how are they traveling alone?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.400]   You look at Ceausescu, you look at him,
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.920]   you're like, something's not right with this guy.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.160]   Not in the sense of like evil,
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.200]   but in the sense of he's a simpleton, right?
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.120]   And now he's in charge of this whole country
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.880]   and everyone's taught to regard him
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.280]   as one of the great geniuses of all time.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.240]   And it's this, the idea of this mediocre nobody,
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.280]   this guy would have in any other culture
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.200]   been accomplished nothing or would have had an honest job
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.560]   where he's like, okay, he works at the mail service
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.760]   and he's bad at it, okay, fine, he's not hurting anyone.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.640]   And now as a result of this, he's responsible
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.200]   for mass death, secret police and incarceration.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.360]   And you know, one of the greatest things I've ever seen,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.840]   which I'm sure many people have seen as well,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.880]   if you go on YouTube, it's his speech
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.520]   and it's the first time the crowd turns
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   and his head kind of, 'cause they start booing him,
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.760]   which was unheard of.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.600]   And he was shot with his dog-faced wife not that long after.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.400]   It was just a great moment, but it's things like this.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.320]   I agree with you that that mediocre weak person
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.040]   is now in a position of power over somebody else.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.080]   And that sense of vindictiveness,
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.160]   like I'm gonna feel strong for once in my life,
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.840]   but it's gonna be at your expense.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.480]   That I think is human nature, it's most primal.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.160]   - And every time I meet a person in this world--
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.960]   - You're the first person to get me to cry
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.160]   on a fucking podcast.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.800]   Fucking the robot gets me to cry.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.280]   What the fuck is going on?
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.520]   - Every time I meet a weird person,
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   somebody, to me, heroism is also taking a risk
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.680]   to rebel against mediocrity.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.560]   - Yeah.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.400]   - Like in the most simplest of ways,
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.760]   like the license address.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.400]   Like taking a risk to break the little bit of rule
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.640]   that nobody will know about,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.440]   to take that little bit of a leap
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.040]   of like that little protest against the bureaucracy.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.080]   - Well, like that Nazi guard where he just spoke out,
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.200]   he's like, "Hey, lady."
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   - But that's a big one.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.040]   - Oh, that's a big one, sure.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.720]   - I mean, like literally at the line at Starbucks
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.560]   or something like that.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.920]   Like even in the tiniest of ways,
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.000]   when I see people just like,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.600]   it's almost like that little like glimmer in their eye,
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.640]   a wink like we're in this together.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.360]   There's all this conformity all around us
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.400]   that's at a different time could have been Nazi Germany,
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.320]   could have been Stalinist Soviet Union.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.520]   We're in this together,
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.840]   we're going to rebel against that conformity
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.600]   by just taking the risk,
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.960]   that little bit of risk against mediocrity.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.800]   I don't know.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   And then once again, I see this in companies too.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.240]   When I see the mediocrity, I see this,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.280]   I used to work at Google,
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.760]   I see it in Google.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.640]   And when the companies grow,
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.560]   that mediocrity is overwhelming.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.720]   - The Peter principle, right?
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.560]   - The Peter principle.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.400]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.520]   My hope is that all of us have the possibility
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:14.320]   for that glimmer, that risk-taking,
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.920]   the leap of faith or whatever the heck that is,
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.680]   the leap out of the ordinary,
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.200]   out of the conformity, out of the mediocrity.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.880]   - So this is where you and I disagree.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.840]   I think most, a lot of people are not capable of that.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.800]   They're accustomed to it.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.320]   I don't know if they're not capable.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.440]   - No, I understand your position,
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.280]   I'm disagreeing with it.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.880]   I'm saying I do not think they're capable.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.680]   I think a lot of people effectively don't have souls.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.960]   They do not have a conscience in this sense
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.520]   where they're going to look at an issue,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.680]   bring their critical thinking and say,
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.360]   "All right, I am going to do the right thing,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.840]   "although I'm taking a risk."
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.200]   - Do you think thinking is involved
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.040]   or is it just taking that leap?
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.720]   There's something about that basic human spirit.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.120]   Forget the thinking part.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.200]   It's just saying, "I'll take that risk."
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.400]   They're taking that adventure.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.360]   The same thing that got people to explore the seas,
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.120]   throughout human civilization,
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.280]   explore land, explore the oceans,
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.240]   that exploration.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.080]   We've done stuff this way all this time.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.440]   I'm going to take a leap.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.000]   And that comes out of nowhere, seemingly.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.600]   - But those people are the heroes,
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.640]   but I don't think that's universal.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:33.320]   I'm going to use a very gauche example.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.360]   There was a show called "Scare Tactics,"
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.880]   which was basically a candid camera,
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.920]   but they would scare people.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.520]   Like they'd have vampires, whatever,
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.720]   and hidden camera and people's reactions.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:48.640]   But sometimes the prank didn't work out like they expected.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.800]   So there was one where they were hiring
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.320]   the people who were the marks,
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.960]   the contestants, so to speak,
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.360]   who were hired to be a security guard.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.200]   And you have to watch this factory overnight
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.400]   and you get paid.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.280]   And what the setup was,
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.960]   some people were breaking out of the factory
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.200]   in the middle of the night, like in rags.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.020]   And they were saying,
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.280]   "They were keeping us prisoner here," like blah, blah, blah,
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.360]   and just watch the person's reaction to this.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.480]   And there was one security guard where they're,
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.240]   he basically forced them back into the building.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.240]   And they're like, they're working us 24/7.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.080]   We're getting beaten.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.800]   He's like, "I'm here to do a job.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.240]   "Get back in there."
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.760]   And you watch this and it never even enters his head
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.920]   to be like, "Something's wrong here.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.640]   "He was given his orders.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   "He's following his orders."
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.480]   And to me, that is not uncommon.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.040]   And that person, although they look like you and I,
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.600]   there's something essentially human missing with them.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.560]   Now, very quickly, the reaction is,
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.080]   "Well, it's one step from there to Nazism."
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.560]   I don't think it's something that,
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.360]   I'm not saying this person should be killed,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.880]   but I'm just saying to expect that every human being
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.160]   has the capacity to have that defiance,
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.040]   especially at a cost to their own life,
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.400]   that I think is not realistic.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.880]   But at the same time,
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.200]   I feel like an octopus on the eighth hand,
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.640]   it is those few of us,
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.880]   or if you want to include me in this,
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:20.160]   who do make these tiny little protests,
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.120]   who look the other way when someone is hungry,
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.280]   who's stealing food from the supermarket, right?
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.400]   It's like, all right, I'm going to pretend
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.520]   I didn't see anything.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:32.040]   Those little elements of heroism
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   are what move humanity forward
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.680]   and demonstrate the validity of the human experience,
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.280]   whereas everyone else is kind of like scenery.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.000]   - I think almost everybody in the world
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   can derive deep meaning and pleasure
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.360]   from having done those courageous acts.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.680]   And I also think they have the capacity to do them,
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.440]   to discover that meaning and happiness.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.480]   - So you're the cynic, then why aren't they doing it?
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.520]   - They haven't gotten a chance to,
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   like I've never tried LSD or DMT.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.320]   You haven't gotten the chance to try this amazing journey,
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.560]   which is taking the risk.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.600]   - That's nonsense, because as you just said two minutes ago,
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   everyone has that chance every day
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.040]   to do the right thing.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.640]   - We have the chance to do a lot of things
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.600]   and we don't realize.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.960]   There's a lot of stuff right in front of our nose
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.200]   that we don't realize.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.040]   - Right.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.200]   - You have to kind of wake up to it.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:30.000]   Sometimes you need the catalyst.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   There needs to be some kind of thing that happens
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.060]   that wakes you up.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:38.560]   The fact that most people
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.520]   don't take the small acts of rebellion
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.720]   doesn't mean they don't have the capacity
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:48.720]   to both do so and to derive a lot of meaning from it.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.840]   Then it's a discussion about how to create societies
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.400]   that get more and more people to be free actors
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.800]   and free thinkers.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.640]   That's the question.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.320]   That probably leads us into a discussion
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   of anarchism and so on.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:07.340]   But I just think we are very young as a species.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:10.680]   We're trying to figure out how to get ourselves
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.960]   to first be collaborative,
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.520]   but at the same time be free spirits.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.560]   I think both of those are within human nature
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.520]   for most of us.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.120]   - I think another big concern
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.240]   is that there's enormous disincentives,
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.760]   and this is Michael Malice speaking,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.040]   for human beings to be kind and for tenderness.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.160]   I think, especially when you're young,
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.320]   you know what I mean, when you're immature,
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.200]   a lot of times someone will reach out to you
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.360]   with kindness or vulnerability
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.520]   and you think it's funny to kind of dunk the head
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.680]   in the water in a pool or something like that.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.600]   And when you get older, you look,
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:50.320]   you know, there's this one example of this.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.640]   This was in the '90s,
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.480]   and there was a woman, she became a stripper
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.000]   or something like that or whatever it was.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.160]   But she had this amazing body.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.680]   She was just gorgeous.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.120]   And the show was, she was talking about
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.800]   how when she was in high school, she was bullied a lot.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.160]   And that there was this football player,
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.400]   he messed with her every single day.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.800]   And like at one day, she even threw pickles in her hair
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.880]   and her hair smelled like pickles
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.320]   and it was laughing at her.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.920]   And this really screwed her up.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.320]   I mean, up to that show.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.600]   And they took her backstage
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.960]   and they brought out the football player.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.920]   Now he's a dad and a regular dude.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.280]   And he's like, "Do you know why you're here?"
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.200]   And he's like, "No."
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.560]   And they're like, "Oh, what were you like in high school?"
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.000]   He's like, "I was kind of a jock, you know, bully, whatever."
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.360]   And they brought her out
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.200]   and he didn't even remember her really.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.280]   And she was just starts crying about the pickles
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.800]   and whatever, and this is something that affected her
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.000]   for like 20 years.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.920]   And I've never seen a clear example
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.240]   of someone who wanted to kill themselves in this guy.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.480]   Like the guilt on his face, and he's looking at her
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.960]   and he's desperate to be like,
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   "What can I do to take your pain away, to make it better?"
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.240]   Like he was just crippled by it
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.920]   'cause he knew there's nothing he could do.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.440]   He knew he 100% did the wrong thing.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.880]   He knew he did the wrong thing unthinkingly.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.240]   Like you can imagine, you know,
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.400]   I got to screw over this lady to feed my family.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.800]   You know, that's fine.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.840]   But at the time it meant nothing to him.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.400]   So of course he didn't remember.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.440]   And he was just paralyzed by this sense of crippling guilt.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.640]   One of the reasons I always tried to do the right thing
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.320]   isn't because I'm an inherently good person,
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.440]   which I do not think I am.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.160]   I don't think anyone is inherently good,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.000]   but because I will feel guilty about it
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.040]   for a very, very long time.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.920]   Because if you do the wrong thing,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.640]   this is a very Camus idea.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:35.560]   If you do the wrong thing to a good person,
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.760]   that's really, really bad
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.040]   'cause what kind of person are you?
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.680]   In the same way that everyone can be that guy
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.840]   who takes someone out for their birthday,
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.600]   everyone has that ability
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.320]   for someone who did the wrong thing
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.560]   to someone who's a normal person.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.960]   And do you want to be that guy as well?
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.640]   My friend, Bittstein, he's a big gold,
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.320]   excuse me, Bitcoin person.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.440]   My biography, "Ego and Hubris" is like $500 now on eBay.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.840]   It's like hard to find, came out in 2006.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.840]   And he had told me that you can get it on Torrent.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.280]   It's downloadable.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.200]   And I'm like, "Oh, I thought if you're my friend,
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.240]   "you'd want to buy it."
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.800]   At the time it was not $500, I assure you.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.200]   And he goes, "I did buy it.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.960]   "I'm just telling you that you could also get it for free,
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.480]   "this information that you might want to use."
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.000]   And I felt, I'm like, I snapped at this kid
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.600]   who was doing right by me.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.880]   And I felt, it just stuck in my head.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.640]   I'm like, "You're an ass."
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.320]   And then years later, I apologized.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.760]   He had no memory of this at all.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.120]   And I'm glad to be able to reiterate the apology again.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:43.120]   But a lot of times I'm extremely aggressive on Twitter
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.040]   and in other venues.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.120]   I always try to, and maybe I fail,
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.200]   and that's my moral failing,
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.480]   always do it as a counterattack.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.560]   If you're going to start going personal,
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.120]   if you're going to start being aggressive
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.440]   against an individual,
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.200]   I'm not going to necessarily hold back when I reciprocate.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.560]   And it's something that is very common on social media,
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.480]   but I don't think it is normal.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.640]   Just because a lot of,
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.200]   this is, you're talking about the quiet little rebellion,
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.240]   just because everyone else around you thinks it's okay
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.040]   to just go up to people and attack them
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.200]   in the most personal ways,
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.720]   imprompted 'cause of their views,
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.480]   really just take a step back
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.760]   and realize what you're engaging with.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.240]   Now, if that's the fight they want,
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.080]   then my Soviet cruelty could come out,
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.920]   and that's kind of why I don't drink,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.440]   'cause I do enjoy it.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.720]   But at the same time, be aware of what you're doing.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.640]   And again, this goes back to Camus' sense
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.760]   that conscience really is what makes us human beings.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.800]   That's the thing I was saying,
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.440]   I don't think most people think in terms of conscience.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.360]   They don't think it, we are taught,
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.080]   this is that creeping cynicism that,
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.240]   oh, grow up, when you're an adult,
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.400]   you have to make sacrifices, blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.960]   And even if I buy that for a second, which I don't,
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.320]   but if I have to make sacrifices sometimes,
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.680]   that doesn't mean it's okay for me
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.360]   to make a sacrifice of my values in this moment.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.480]   If I have to maybe be at work,
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.720]   and my boss is a jerk to me and calls me names,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.880]   I have to be humiliated,
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.680]   but I got to put food on the plate,
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.680]   that doesn't mean it's okay later if I'm at a party
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.820]   and I'm just extremely offensive to someone for no reason.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:24.920]   - My own flavor of a little bit of rebellion.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.400]   - Sometimes I use the number two.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.640]   (laughing)
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:34.920]   - Is, you're very witty on Twitter.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.760]   - Thank you.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:43.000]   - And Twitter likes mockery and wit,
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.840]   and on Counter-Attack is,
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.040]   Twitter loves that, somebody who's skilled at it.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.120]   My own flavor of a bit of rebellion
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.400]   is to say things very simply,
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.900]   bordering on cliche,
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:05.760]   with authenticity and like genuinely meaning
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:08.160]   the words I say,
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.700]   but knowing that those words would be,
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.920]   are easy to attack.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.760]   - Sure.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.280]   - And that, sometimes those attacks can hurt
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.400]   because people would just mock me.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.520]   - Sure, people don't like earnestness
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.180]   'cause they've been taught to be too cool for school.
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.280]   - Yeah, so there's this pressure for me
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.920]   to be sound way more sophisticated.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.740]   - Yeah.
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:34.740]   - Use bigger words, sometimes throw in a criticism
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.040]   of institutions or something like that.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.460]   Like almost as if I have a deep wisdom
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.640]   about the way the world is broken.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.140]   But when you speak very simply
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.360]   about beautiful things in life,
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.440]   it's very easy to sound like you don't know
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.640]   what the hell you're talking about.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.480]   - Sure.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.000]   - And I kind of, I stick by that.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.800]   I don't know where that's gonna end up,
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.400]   but it's like the idiot from Dostoevsky.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.080]   It feels like that's the right thing,
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.360]   even if it hurts when I'm attacked for it.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.320]   - I do something similar sometimes,
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.480]   which is I'll have some innocuous comment
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.560]   about like bubblegum.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.840]   I mean, just it's not to be in political.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.440]   And a lot of times people,
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.560]   will respond to this paragraph of just invective
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.160]   about like blah, blah, blah, and then this,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.480]   and you say this, and you're an ass,
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.880]   and just really trying to get at me.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.000]   And what I, in those situations,
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.200]   there are very specific circumstances,
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.080]   I will respond and I mean it every single time.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.480]   I will say, I wish your parents had been kinder to you
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.880]   or your mom or your dad.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.600]   Because if someone is some,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.440]   even if I'm some idiot on Twitter, right?
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.520]   Who just talk about bubblegum, and this is your response.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.480]   I'm not talking about politics
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.840]   where I can see how people get emotional.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.280]   COVID, my grandma died, now you're talking about her.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.120]   And I realize this isn't about me.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.360]   Like I'm someone you've never met,
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.960]   making some inane point about nothing.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.000]   And you're getting agitated about this.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.560]   It's clearly something else that's going on here.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.480]   And someone taught you, someone had to teach you,
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   that this is how to respond
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.920]   in this kind of very kind of harsh way.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.960]   And a lot of times they'll,
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.080]   they won't say anything or get deleted.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.920]   And I hope every single time,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.320]   there's no asterisk here, that they take a second,
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.760]   and they realize that the way that they were talked to
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.760]   growing up was not acceptable,
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.400]   that they don't have to carry this forward,
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.640]   and that they don't have to be kind to me.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.880]   I'm nobody to them.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.920]   But take a second and ask if this is the kind of mindset
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.640]   you want to be your norm,
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.600]   as opposed to a weapon you pull out of your pocket
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.720]   sometimes where it's warranted,
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.400]   or even when it's not warranted.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.440]   I think there's a lot of those people out there,
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   and we forget how,
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.640]   you know, how hard it is for a lot of people to grow up,
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.200]   how they're trained from their parents or the single parent,
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.040]   that the only way they're going to get attention
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.200]   is by acting out,
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.000]   that when they do good things, it doesn't get comment.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.240]   But if they do bad things,
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.000]   they got to smack upside their head.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.160]   That I think is far more common than we realize.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.840]   And that's such a, it's not even,
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.680]   it's not hitting the kid that's going to last.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.800]   The pain is going to give five seconds.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.280]   But when you're training this child, helpless child,
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.200]   is something that's really, really bad.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.640]   - I don't know if it always can be mapped to that.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.800]   I always wonder about them, like what their motivations are.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.380]   And I just kind of, like, whenever I think about them,
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.800]   I think only positively.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.240]   And I don't even think about the childhood thing.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.800]   I think, I don't know.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.320]   I kind of imagine that all of us can go through that stage
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.060]   where we enjoy the derision of others.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.360]   We go through stages of being-
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.000]   - I enjoy the derision of others, but it has to be,
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.200]   you know, Billy, I'd have that quote,
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.640]   like I like it when people are mean to me,
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.480]   I got to stop pretending to be nice.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.720]   But like, what's the worst thing
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.680]   someone can say about you?
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.520]   You're not, what harm are you doing?
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.360]   Maybe your podcast is garbage and the people are,
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.000]   the conversations suck and the people are losers, okay.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.280]   - No, the main thing I would say is I'm way more popular
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.520]   than I deserve to be.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.960]   - What does deserve mean?
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.480]   - The reality is there's people out there
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.960]   that just enjoy hating on others.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.960]   And I don't fault them for it.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.280]   Like, I don't even think of them as haters.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.600]   I think of them as just people
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.520]   that in this particular part of their life
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.080]   are enjoying this activity
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.660]   of deriding others on the internet.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.280]   I'm not sure what to do with that.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.680]   I just don't want to,
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.060]   I don't want to allow myself to think badly of them,
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.460]   I guess is the thing.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.180]   - I'm the one saying, don't think badly of them.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.660]   I'm saying that I don't think they're inherently bad people.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.340]   I think that their thinking is screwed
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.020]   and that I'm steel manning them.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.460]   I'm saying, let's assume everything
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.240]   you're saying about Lex is true.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.460]   This is an opportunity for you to outdo Lex.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.460]   Like it's--
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.780]   - No, but are you saying they should stop hating?
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.260]   'Cause I'm saying like, maybe they shouldn't just keep--
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.780]   - I don't believe in should, right?
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.220]   I'm an anarchist, but I'm saying is like,
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.280]   if this is your belief about Lex,
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.520]   you know what it is?
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.720]   I made this comment in my book, "The New Right"
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.700]   when people make fun of Andy Warhol
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.000]   and they're like, oh my God, he painted a soup can
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.400]   and now he became a millionaire.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.440]   I could do this.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.880]   Well, why don't you?
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.080]   So basically, if I go up to you with a check
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.900]   and I say, I will give you a million dollars,
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.800]   you could see the check, you got to paint a soup can,
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.160]   what am I waiting for?
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.720]   So clearly there's a disconnect in their thinking
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.520]   between what they're perceiving and the reality
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.900]   because if it was as simple or as, maybe not simple,
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:38.900]   but as possible for them as they perceive it to be,
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.260]   why are they leaving comments instead of outdoing you?
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.060]   How great would it be for them
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.360]   to have your bigger audience and drive you into the ground?
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.100]   I don't know how that would work 'cause it's not the NBA,
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:48.940]   but--
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.580]   - No, but you wanna point out, you do this too on Twitter.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:55.580]   You wanna point out the hypocrisy,
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.860]   the fraudulence of others, right?
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.340]   - Sure, but what are you, you're not claiming anything
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.960]   other than this is, the following is a conversation
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.880]   between me and Machiki, whatever his name is, right?
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.680]   I got the voice down, dude, I got it down.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.160]   I've been walking around my house doing my Lex impression.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.800]   I've been leaking motor oil everywhere.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.320]   - Yeah, but yeah, I don't know.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.360]   I don't know what to make of it
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.600]   'cause I think there's a more general statement to be made.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.520]   Like I see Twitter this way too.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.440]   When I read a tweet, I try to read it
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.840]   with like the best possible interpretation,
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.660]   meaning like what is the wisdom in this tweet?
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.500]   - Sure.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.420]   - As opposed to what I think a large number of people,
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.440]   not a large number, but some fraction,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.700]   try to see what is the worst possible interpretation
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:43.540]   of this tweet.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.540]   And they want to destroy you for that worst interpretation.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:53.260]   Like they wanna, there's people, I'm already aware of this
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.140]   with me and certainly with a lot of people,
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.940]   they're waiting for me to fail.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:00.660]   They want me to be like this guy talks about love
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.500]   all the time.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.860]   They want me to be some dark, like a-
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.260]   - They want you to be in pain.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.460]   Yeah, they want you to be in pain because they don't-
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.300]   - Why?
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.260]   - I'll tell you exactly why.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.660]   Because this is why I'm so for being white pilled
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.800]   and being for hope.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.700]   Because if you are black pilled,
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.840]   meaning if you think it's pointless, we're all done,
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.620]   if you're just wasting your breath,
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.560]   if you have any counter examples to this thesis,
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.940]   if there's even a little bit of hope,
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.060]   your entire hypothesis falls through, right?
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:30.060]   So it's kind of how like you have all these stories
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:33.220]   of people who are like painting swastikas who aren't Nazis,
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.700]   but just to show that, oh, there's all this Nazism.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:38.680]   So I'm gonna kind of force the conclusion.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.220]   So for them, when they see you thriving,
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:44.860]   you are as a mediocre person with a crappy show,
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.220]   but you're demonstrating that people can succeed,
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.300]   this bothers them.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.900]   So you are-
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.860]   - Anyone can succeed that bothers them.
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.500]   - Yeah, so because that why haven't they?
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.940]   So now you're a counter to their worldview,
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.860]   and that is going to cause anxiety
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:00.260]   when you have data that contradicts other data
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:03.060]   in your worldview, in your mindset,
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.260]   this is a big issue for them.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.700]   - Yeah, so anyone listening to this,
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.300]   they're annoyed by the look of my face.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.940]   Remember that you could probably do way better than me
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:12.900]   and you should.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.620]   - But also what would you failing look like?
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.380]   Like, let's suppose this podcast went
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.040]   from whatever views you had to 100 views an episode,
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.540]   that's still success.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.660]   You are talking to people you like,
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.860]   having conversations about important issues,
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.120]   you're having a good time, they're giving a time,
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.240]   how is that a failure?
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.060]   If I have dinner with a friend of mine,
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.500]   there's zero viewers and we enjoy that time,
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.860]   that is the height of human success
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.380]   when you are sharing-
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:41.220]   - Happiness.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.740]   - Happiness, joy, joy over love.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.940]   - So what's the difference between joy and love,
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:46.780]   Michael Malice?
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.820]   - I think joy is easier to attain,
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.500]   it's more common, you could share it with
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.340]   everyone.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.260]   - Give me an example of joy,
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.180]   like what was a moment of joy for you recently?
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.140]   - I could give you a great example of joy
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.340]   and this is part in the absurdist mindset, okay?
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.340]   I love having a bad meal at a restaurant
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.280]   and you could see why.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.940]   You go with your friend,
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.540]   it takes you 45 minutes to get seated.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.540]   Okay, I'm starving.
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.380]   Waiter's not paying attention to you.
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.340]   They bring your water, it's got a hair in it.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.780]   They get the food wrong.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.060]   It comes out again, it's ripe but it's cold.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.320]   At a certain point, you're like, okay, I'm hungry.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.300]   I'm living an anecdote.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.460]   This is something that if you were at dinner,
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.940]   we could talk about this for years
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:35.760]   because how great is it that the worst thing
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.120]   that's happening to me is I gotta wait an hour
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.500]   for this meal that's gonna be cooked wrong, right?
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:45.460]   That to me is joy, is holding on to that idea
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.540]   that happiness and thriving are possible
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.740]   even when in the moment everything's going the wrong way.
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.820]   - Doesn't every moment have the capacity
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.500]   to fill you with joy then?
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.340]   - Yes, yes.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.220]   - So it's both the shitty moments and the good moments.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.060]   - Yes.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:03.000]   - But see, that's the way I usually talk about love
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.100]   is like I love life.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:07.940]   - Yes.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:11.220]   - And because life can generate everything,
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:16.220]   the pain, the loss, but also just like simple
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.820]   or complicated bliss, all of that, I just love all of that.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:24.940]   And that because it fills me with a kind of, I guess, joy,
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.300]   but joy has a connotation that it's supposed
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.500]   to be somehow positive, like you're supposed to be smiling.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.140]   To me, "Man's Search for Meaning" with Viktor Frankl,
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:41.160]   you're in the Holocaust, you're in a concentration camp,
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.700]   just having a little bit of food
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.780]   that you didn't expect you will have,
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.660]   or even just thinking about food.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.900]   - Or what about there's a kid there,
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.780]   you tell him a funny story and you crack him up.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.620]   - Yeah.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.220]   - Like you take away this child's pain for like five minutes.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.780]   That is the height of joy.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.860]   - Yeah, so to me, all of life is infinitely full
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.220]   of possibility for joy.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.060]   - Yes.
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.060]   - And that's what I mean by love,
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:07.540]   'cause oftentimes romantic love is what people think about
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.700]   when they think love, but to me,
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.020]   it's all part of the same thing.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:14.260]   And it's almost like love, romantic love,
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.660]   or love with a friend, friendship,
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.900]   is like you both notice each other.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.660]   It's like dogs, they look at each other
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.980]   and then they look at the thing they're interested in.
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:27.280]   You both notice each other and that moment of joy.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.860]   You share that moment of joy together.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:29.700]   - Yeah, like the restaurant.
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:30.900]   - The restaurant.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:35.900]   Yeah, if you're both almost without conspiring,
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:40.220]   notice the absurdity of how shitty this meal is.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.780]   And like that, again, that little glimmer of realization,
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.540]   that's what makes life beautiful.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.740]   You mentioned your grandmother in Lvov.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.900]   You were thinking of returning there.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.880]   The plans got a little bit delayed,
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.940]   but what are you hoping from that trip
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.140]   of going back to Russia, going back to Ukraine?
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.780]   What do you hope to get out of it,
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.580]   but what do you think you will feel?
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.440]   - A lot of things.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.460]   First of all, I'm going with my buddy, Chris Williamson.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.340]   He hosts the Modern Wisdom Podcast.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.660]   He is one of my closest friends.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.060]   We've never met.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:17.900]   - Oh, really?
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.720]   - We've never met.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.560]   He's in Britain.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.920]   He's trying to get his ass over here to Austin.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.500]   He's filling out his form right now.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.860]   - He's too good looking.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.700]   It's a crime.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.460]   - I call him Apollo and I'm Loki.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.100]   So right away you have a buddy comedy
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.220]   'cause we're gonna film it, right?
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.220]   You have these two guys who on paper,
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.140]   you're very dissimilar, but we're very, very close.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.500]   - In which way are you similar?
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:43.540]   - I think we're both very intense people,
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.660]   very strong emotionally.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.740]   We're both very ambitious in the sense that,
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.700]   not in terms of career,
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.260]   but we wanna grab life by the short hairs kind of thing.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.660]   We're just both good experiences.
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.940]   - Did he bench more than you or?
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:03.060]   - Oh yeah, he's, of course.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.220]   I mean, the guy's jacked.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.060]   He's just-
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.300]   - 'Cause he's so good looking.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.500]   He could be one of those guys who's mostly biceps.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.620]   - Oh no, no, no.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.220]   If you look at, go to his Instagram,
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.140]   Chris Willex is his handle.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.340]   It's like head to toe, it's just sculpted.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.580]   - So he's perfect in every way.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:19.420]   That's great.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.660]   - He-
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.860]   - What flaws does he have?
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:22.700]   'Cause I need-
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.180]   - He has bad taste in friends.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.660]   (laughing)
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:27.620]   And his accent is all crazy.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:31.820]   He pronounces it, he's an underwear muddle.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.420]   (laughing)
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.380]   Now I spell it M-U-D-L.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:37.860]   So just us two, British and American
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.900]   and just two different dudes,
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.820]   it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.580]   Although to be fair, as you know,
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.180]   I'm an underwear model now as well.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:46.540]   So we're gonna talk that in a second, maybe.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.900]   But yeah, sheathunderwear.com.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:52.260]   - Yeah, this episode is brought to you by Sheath Underwear.
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.940]   Are we gonna get some pictures eventually?
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.700]   - I think we might, yeah.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.460]   Yes, I have them on my phone.
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.220]   We'll have them, we can share them right.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.860]   You could slice it in right here.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.820]   So to be able to go with someone who is a very close,
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.860]   I mean, we meet him, talk like every day, right?
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.740]   So to someone who generally cares about you,
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:15.260]   he's very, very grounded, right?
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.060]   So like a lot of times I'll have like some concern
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.500]   and he's really good.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.820]   And if you listen to his show
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.780]   at slicing through the noise and being like,
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.860]   hold on a second, I can't do the accent yet.
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:26.580]   Have you considered A, B and C?
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.660]   Because you know, whenever I had the situation,
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:29.500]   this is what I did.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.460]   So he's really good with that.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.260]   So to have a, first of all,
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.380]   just like two buddies on a trip is a really a lot of fun.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:41.460]   Second of all, I know that it's gonna be very intense.
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.620]   So for you, you left Russia much later than I did.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.500]   How old were you? - 13.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.340]   - 13, right.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.980]   So you remember it, I'm sure very, very well.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.540]   I left when I was one and a half, two.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.580]   I don't remember it all.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:54.220]   To go to the streets where, you know,
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:56.780]   my family had to go through this stuff to see the,
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.860]   you know, they came to Lvov, they slaughtered all the Jews.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.860]   I mean, to have that little memorial there that's there now
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.780]   and to just look around and know yesterday, basically,
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.580]   they came here, they rounded everyone up.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.260]   And also from the other side,
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.620]   you had the Stalinists coming in
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.020]   and starving all the people.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.340]   It's just to know that so much horror and death.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.820]   There's this quote I saw once
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.820]   about a woman who went to Auschwitz
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:23.460]   and she just made the comment like, "Grass grows here."
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.780]   'Cause we think, you know,
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.700]   that when it comes to the nature of evil,
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.540]   that you're gonna go there,
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.700]   there's gonna be this pits of hell or whatever.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.100]   There's birds, you know, there's, you know,
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.700]   robins hopping around looking for the worms or whatever.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.980]   They think it's perfectly nice.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.420]   And you stand there to understand
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.020]   that so much suffering happened here
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.060]   or there is gonna be very jarring.
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.900]   I know that it's going to be an issue
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.380]   because I speak Russian and not Ukrainian.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.180]   And to speak Russian to Ukrainians is like a big deal.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.820]   So that's gonna be a concern.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.260]   I'm also worried about going to Russia
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:56.080]   because every Russian has this idea
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.740]   that even though they've just met you,
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.860]   they feel that they're in a position
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.420]   to tell you what you're doing wrong with your life,
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.500]   what you should be doing if they're a cab driver.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.900]   I have no tolerance for unsolicited advice.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.140]   And at base at all, that's gonna be horrible.
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.980]   They're gonna be telling me I need to speak Russian better
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.340]   because (speaking in foreign language)
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.500]   I'm not hearing it.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.220]   I'm not interested in hearing it.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.940]   So that I think, and also, you know,
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.380]   given my upcoming book, "The White Pill"
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.500]   and covering what happened back in the day
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.300]   under Stalinism and later,
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.420]   to see this was the Lubyanka,
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.380]   this was the basement where they would, you know,
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:31.100]   you know, this is something that people might not realize.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.660]   There's a superb film, "The Death of Stalin,"
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.820]   which is kind of, does what I do with North Korea.
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.460]   You know, puts a humorous spin on it.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.660]   Then when you take a step back
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:39.860]   and you realize what they're actually saying,
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.540]   it's just like, it's very, very disturbing.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.900]   How when Stalin was dying, he had a stroke.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.540]   He's laying there in a pile of his own piss.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.060]   He's unconscious.
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:49.740]   He, right before he died,
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.260]   he thought the doctors were all plotting against him.
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.740]   So they were being tortured to confess
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.300]   that they were trying to murder him.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:59.500]   They had to get the doctors out of the torture chambers
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.700]   to attend to him and they did it.
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.700]   So this kind of thing to like go there,
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:05.900]   like Red Square and see,
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.780]   this is where it happened to see Lenin's body.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:11.580]   Like this is the guy who Emma Goldman yelled at.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.240]   It's gonna be really,
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.220]   'cause I've worked so much in this space,
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.020]   jarring and intense and emotional.
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.820]   And as intense as it is for me sitting here
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:21.940]   talking to you about it,
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.900]   to see it and to see the faces
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.380]   and to see Cyrillic everywhere,
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.740]   you know, other than Brighton Beach and Brooklyn,
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:30.740]   it's gonna, I'm sure it's gonna do a huge number on me
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:35.740]   because as Western and as the (speaking in foreign language)
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.220]   as the Russians will say I am,
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.300]   this is still where I came from.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.780]   So no matter to see it face to face,
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.900]   I don't know how I'm gonna react,
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.740]   but I don't think it's gonna be like, meh.
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.020]   - You've assembled a number of essays
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.300]   from anarchist thinkers in a new book
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.660]   called "The Anarchist Handbook."
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.400]   You mentioned Emma Goldman.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.460]   What interesting things do these thinkers agree on
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:00.660]   and what do they disagree on?
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:03.140]   - The anarchist handbook.com is the website.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.340]   It covers from the 1790s to,
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.780]   I think my essay is the last one from 2014,
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:11.420]   which a friend of mine who's kind of a mediocre scientist
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.860]   is gonna be reading for the audio book.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.780]   - Also podcast.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.020]   - Also podcast, I never,
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.100]   but it's not a podcast anyone would have heard of.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:20.820]   It's like Tom Woods, but even worse.
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:25.820]   So what they all agreed on was the illegitimacy of government
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:30.540]   and also the malevolence of state actors
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:34.020]   and the consequences of governments.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:39.020]   So they range in terms that most people would easily regard
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.680]   as either left or right wing,
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.180]   but it tackles the nature of government
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.540]   and also creates positive non-state alternatives
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.580]   from really many different angles.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.540]   The slogan I have is the black flag,
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.220]   which is the traditional flag of anarchism.
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.380]   The black flag comes in many colors.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.260]   So they were really all over the map
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.860]   in terms of what they're for,
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:02.500]   but their disagreement is about the nature of state
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.540]   and the nature of power.
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:07.120]   And it's very edifying 'cause this is an ideology
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.580]   that's been in many ways swept under the rug.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.660]   No one takes this seriously, grow up,
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.620]   that I can allow people to sit down and read these essays
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.820]   and see for themselves just how beautiful this tapestry
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.900]   over the decades and centuries has been woven
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:25.820]   about people who genuinely believed in freedom
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:30.820]   as the most important and how to maximize that for society.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.460]   - So maybe it's useful to talk about
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.180]   a few contrasting thinkers in there.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.180]   So one is Leo Tolstoy.
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.180]   - Oh yeah.
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:45.180]   - Who I think not many people know is an anarchist.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.860]   - Yes.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.380]   - A Christian anarchist.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.540]   - Christian anarchist, yeah.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.700]   - So he came to despise government
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.820]   for his deceit and his violence.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:59.180]   But to him, the Christian principles of nonviolence,
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.660]   I think, are important.
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:04.460]   - Oh yeah, and it's kind of pacifist kind of mindset of,
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.580]   you know, it's better to someone to punch you
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.740]   than to punch them back.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.780]   - So he's in that way, at least I read,
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.180]   he influenced MLK and Gandhi.
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.220]   What do you think about this flavor,
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.700]   color of the anarchist flag of nonviolence,
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.140]   nonviolent opposition?
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.220]   - I will put the caveat that it bothers me
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:27.180]   when people bring up MLK 'cause he's become so corporate
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.340]   and everyone just brings him up without knowing about him.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.380]   One of the things that Martin Luther King did so very well
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:37.980]   was that he forced people to face the consequences
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.220]   of what they were putting forward.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.460]   You wanna be racist, you wanna be for Jim Crow,
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.460]   you wanna be for segregation, okay,
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.540]   it's easy for you to do that from your living room.
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:50.620]   Now turn on your news and you see men and women in suits
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:54.420]   being attacked by dogs, being attacked by fire hoses
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:57.100]   and beaten by cops just so they could sit
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.500]   on the front of the bus.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.540]   And now for a lot of people who were still racist,
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.580]   who were still had animus toward black people
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:07.520]   are watching this and it's gonna be a lot harder
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.260]   to be like, I'm okay with this, I'm okay with human beings,
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.900]   even ones I regard as somehow bad or inferior
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:18.260]   to be beaten and attacked by trained dogs
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.180]   and they're not doing anything in response.
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.260]   That strikes to I think a very basic nature
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:26.740]   of especially American like, okay, whatever you're for,
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.580]   I'm not for people getting beaten and attacked
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.460]   when they're not really doing anything.
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.460]   So I think pacifism is something that's very easy
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:38.460]   to make fun of, but people don't underestimate
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:41.940]   how powerful it is for someone to say,
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.900]   you can do what you want to me,
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:47.260]   I'm not gonna fight you back, I just want to live peacefully
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.060]   and have the same rights as you and to say,
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.460]   screw you, you should get beaten.
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:55.100]   That's a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.780]   So I think he was really and Gandhi of course as well,
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.260]   were excellent in that regard.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.180]   There's a little bit of Machiavellianism to it.
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.560]   They've both been beatified in regard to saints,
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.300]   but their strategy worked very, very well
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.340]   for their purposes.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:14.220]   So I think just all of us, when you see someone
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.060]   in this kind of Christian, I know you're Ron,
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.100]   obviously it's nothing very highly Christianity,
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.820]   but if he's someone who's willing to take a punch
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:25.300]   and to say, you could do whatever you want to me,
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.980]   I'm not going to hurt somebody else,
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.820]   instinctively, and maybe this is kind of a hack,
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.140]   most people wanna side with that guy,
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.740]   step in between and be like, oh, okay,
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.420]   let's take a step back because whatever led to this
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.860]   is not tenable, we need to go back to the drawing board
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.660]   if the consequence is people are having these
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.960]   as a result of my decisions and actions.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   So I think that aspect of anarchism is very, very,
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.700]   in certain contexts, healthy and much smarter
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.620]   and more sophisticated than people give it credit for.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:01.740]   And let's also point out that Tolstoy wrote "War and Peace"
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.300]   and he wrote "Anna Karenina."
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.760]   So this was not some naive or innocent,
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.020]   whatever word you wanna use.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.860]   He knew the nature of evil.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.760]   He knew how bad things get.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.620]   So he wasn't saying at all that human beings
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.060]   are inherently nice and kind.
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:18.780]   He was saying it's much more effective to not fight back
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.660]   and to force them to face that.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.540]   I'll give you another example.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.980]   I was talking to, I was on the show "Trigonometry"
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:28.020]   and I was talking to the hosts and one of them
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:32.660]   talked about how someone he knew had been the Gulag
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.900]   or his mom was born the Gulag grandma.
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:38.140]   And after Stalin died and the Soviet Union liberalized
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.860]   and lots of the people in the Gulags were freed
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.560]   by Khrushchev and so on and so forth,
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.120]   I didn't know this, many of the, or some, let's say some,
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.560]   of the guards of the Gulags killed themselves
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.360]   because they had genuinely believed
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.320]   that everyone in these camps was there for a reason.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.760]   And when they found out that these people
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.560]   were completely innocent, didn't even have trials,
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.120]   and that they were the ones forcing them
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.920]   to work themselves to death and starve,
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.120]   they couldn't deal with that guilt.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:10.120]   So when you are a pacifist or non-retaliatory
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.920]   and you're forcing someone who's using force,
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.820]   like look what you're doing, look what you've become.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.000]   For some people, some people don't care.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.400]   You know, like the guy in "Scare Tactics"
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.760]   like I mentioned earlier, where for a lot of others,
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.400]   they're gonna be like, okay,
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.880]   is this who I wanted to grow up to be?
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.440]   They will have that little flame of conscious
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.760]   that you and I talked about earlier.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.640]   They will be like, how did I get to the point
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.500]   where there's this lady who wants to ride the bus
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:37.000]   and she's, you know, lovely dressed, put together,
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.120]   and I have a, sending a dog on her?
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.400]   What kind of person am I?
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.080]   For some of those people, they're gonna be like,
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080]   okay, I can't be a part of this.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.760]   I don't even understand the politics.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.520]   I still am racist, but I'm not going to take part
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.200]   in this atrocity.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:56.160]   - Well, that was for him from the individual perspective,
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.520]   perhaps he calls that Christian,
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.160]   but listening to that voice of conscience,
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.320]   like whatever that is in you.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:09.320]   So for Tolstoy, it seems like anarchism
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.300]   from the individual perspective
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.640]   is silencing the rest of the world
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.720]   and listening to the, for him probably,
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.120]   God-given voice of conscience.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   And so that's what it means to live, embody anarchism.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.360]   - And to embody Christianity, I would think he would say.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.200]   - But he would see those as basically.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.480]   - Yes, correct.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.900]   - Yeah, so in terms of forms of government,
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:37.360]   the Christian government is one that's no government.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.280]   - Yeah, correct.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:44.200]   - What do you think about that as advice
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.560]   for an individual, turn the other cheek?
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.080]   Do you think, I tend to believe
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.400]   that that's a really good way to live.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.800]   - I think it's very underrated, and this is me talking.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.520]   I think a lot of times when someone,
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.440]   let's suppose you're having an argument,
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.120]   and, but you have to pick your battles, right?
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.360]   Let's suppose you're having a heat argument
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.460]   and someone says something very cruel to you,
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.300]   where you have attempted to double down
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.820]   and hit back twice as hard.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.620]   But if it's someone who at all cares about you,
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:12.020]   but they're just in the moment and you just stop,
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.880]   and you just say, did you hear what you just said to me?
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.700]   For some cases, that person will take a step back
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.340]   and be like, just like when I snapped at Michael
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:24.380]   at Bitstein years ago, I'd be like, wow, okay, this is bad.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.460]   This is bad, I'm sorry.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.680]   And they kind of, it's kind of like,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.500]   they have to get to 10 before they control
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.220]   or delete to use your language.
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:33.060]   - Thank you.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:33.880]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.640]   - But for overflow, I appreciate that.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.040]   - But, and for some, they're gonna just twist the knife,
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.760]   but I think this is a very useful technique.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.040]   And also, you can also sleep well at night,
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.000]   'cause you could be like,
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.920]   as much as this person tried to hurt me,
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.000]   I still didn't reciprocate.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.920]   And yeah, I took that punch and it sucks,
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.280]   but at least I never said anything
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.840]   that I could feel guilty about.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.600]   - Exactly.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.540]   Do you think that's ultimately a good way
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:04.320]   to implement anarchy in your personal life?
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.260]   - Anarchy, implementing anarchy in your personal life
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:12.380]   just means respecting people's boundaries.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:16.900]   It means not forcing people to do things
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:18.480]   that they otherwise wouldn't want to do.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.180]   - I think you then have to take case by case.
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.100]   Like, there's so many human interactions
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.460]   that are required for life.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.580]   And there's tension and all those kinds of things.
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:30.420]   It's not always--
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:31.840]   - Am I being naive or innocent?
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.960]   - You're being so naive.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.800]   No, it's--
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:35.640]   - Should I put the hat on?
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.120]   (laughing)
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.560]   The hat's on the other head now.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.720]   - Well, I had to take off the hat,
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.160]   'cause it's like Frodo with the ring.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.740]   I was starting to feel powerful.
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.040]   I wanted to give you orders.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   No, I just, I think there's ways of dealing
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.680]   with the tensions that are natural to human interactions
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.760]   that can't be simply,
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.940]   it's not as simple as saying you want to respect
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:06.300]   the freedom of others and the boundaries of others.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:09.400]   It's like, you both have to agree on stuff
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.740]   and work something out.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.540]   And the mechanisms of that agreement,
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.460]   the game theory of that agreement
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.660]   requires different hacks and strategies.
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:21.660]   And the question is, for an anarchist collective
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:26.360]   that's well-functioning, what kind of hacks,
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.800]   what kind of ways of behavior
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.500]   are more likely to be productive and not?
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.180]   That's almost like the question.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.480]   Do you want to turn the other cheek
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.060]   or do you want to stand your ground really firmly?
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:41.720]   When somebody is an asshole to you, you walk away.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.280]   Or when somebody is an asshole to you,
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.600]   you turn the other cheek and give them a chance
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.920]   to rise to the best version of themselves
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.600]   and then find a common ground kind of thing.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.800]   It's an open question of how to form those collectives
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.700]   when there's people with difficult childhoods
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.940]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.100]   - Well, this also comes down to
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.220]   what is your relationship with this person?
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.120]   Is this out of character?
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.140]   If you and I got into a disagreement,
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.900]   all of a sudden you started getting very personal.
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.340]   First, I'd be very hurt,
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.260]   but then I'd be like, this is out of character for Lex.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.540]   I'm sure I could be like, whoa, let's take a pause here.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.060]   Like you're getting heated, I'm trying to work this out.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.140]   Look, what's going on here?
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.120]   And you get a kind of a meta conversation.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.800]   But again, you and I have a relationship of mutual respect.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.260]   So as opposed to if it was a stranger,
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.060]   you know, who just wants a piece of you,
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:29.800]   it's just like, you are coming at me not correct.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.780]   I don't have to reciprocate in kind.
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.100]   I'm not gonna shoot you,
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.020]   but I'm not gonna pretend that you deserve respect
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:38.460]   when you're treating me with such contempt.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:42.460]   I do defer, especially with people I know,
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.620]   'cause this is smart long-term game theory
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.240]   as well as the right thing to do.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.660]   I do try to give them the benefit of the doubt at first.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.060]   Because if you're gonna go aggro, you can't go back.
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.420]   But you could always go from like, let me hear them out
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.900]   and then I could go aggro.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:56.540]   So there's a big asymmetry there.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.700]   - Yeah, and that's, I mean,
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.740]   I don't think anyone has the answer to this question
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.420]   is that the right strategy.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.740]   To me, game theoretically,
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.620]   it seems the right strategy is to--
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:08.420]   - Well, reciprocity is what game theory says
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:09.380]   is the right strategy.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:10.780]   They did the prisoner's dilemma
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:11.820]   and they found tit for tat
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.700]   is the one that's the most advantageous.
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:16.100]   - So that's for when it's perfectly rational actors.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.180]   But when you have, I mean, there's noise.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:23.400]   There's, I think, benefit to just,
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.640]   even if they keep being shitty to you,
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.800]   still being nice to them.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.840]   - Well, then there's the inverse
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:29.880]   where girls are turned off.
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.880]   Some people, like if you're in a relationship
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.280]   and not just girls, but girls,
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.280]   like some people, when you're kind to them,
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.720]   they find you less attractive, right?
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.520]   That is kind of this weird, what am I supposed to do?
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.480]   Like, you're only into me if I'm mean to you.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.600]   I don't wanna be mean,
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.680]   but then I'm getting punished for doing the right thing.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.240]   That's another tricky one.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.120]   And I mean, this is nothing that necessarily
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.320]   to do with anarchism so much as like,
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.240]   human beings are infinitely complex.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.760]   We don't often know the backstory.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.160]   Like for example, just yesterday,
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.360]   Jay, who's here is one of my closest friends.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.320]   I had a dinner with a bunch of people.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:06.160]   I couldn't bring a plus four, so he wasn't invited.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.700]   He didn't know the circumstances.
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.200]   He just thought we were having dinner without him.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.160]   He was hurt.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.400]   Once I spelled it out, he completely understood.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.440]   And I felt horrible because for me
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.400]   to have any of my friends feel left out
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.280]   is just a very, very cruel thing.
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.960]   And I felt bad and I'm glad to apologize again publicly
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.560]   that that's ended up being the circumstances.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:27.360]   But yeah, a lot of times we're also in Plato's cave.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.760]   When you're dealing with somebody else,
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:30.640]   you have very, very limited information
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.520]   about their background and circumstances.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.000]   And that's why I will always,
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.320]   if it's someone I even have a little bit of a relationship
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.520]   with, try to give them the benefit of the doubt.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.760]   Because I found, especially this comes from being a co-author
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.640]   when you co-author books
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.240]   and you're walking in other people's shoes,
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.480]   you don't know a lot of the information.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.120]   So a lot of times it's just a misunderstanding.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.280]   - But isn't that a fundamentally anarchist question
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.760]   of how we figure out this puzzle of human complexities
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.600]   in order to form voluntary collectives?
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.040]   Like we have to figure that out,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:04.240]   how to make people feel good, how to make people--
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.320]   - I agree, that's fair.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.160]   - And that--
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.760]   - I think not only anarchists have to think about this
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.680]   is my point, of course.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.800]   - Well--
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.880]   - But we have to think about it more than others do.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.760]   - Right, I feel like I should try to argue against anarchism
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.560]   at some point, out of love, out of love.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.880]   And so because people--
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.880]   - Out of joy.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.880]   - People enjoy seeing me, what is it,
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.920]   when like Ben Shapiro argues against
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:29.760]   like a 20-year-old feminist--
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.680]   - Ben Shapiro destroys high school students
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.520]   with Maximum Logic.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.360]   - This is this video of Michael Malice destroys
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:40.360]   a Marxist Russian communist pig.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:43.520]   So anarchism as opposed to hierarchies.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:46.000]   - Well, that's left anarchism, anarcho-communism, yeah.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:46.840]   - The state.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.760]   - But there are many hierarchies that are not the state.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.320]   We have a hierarchy here, this is your show,
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.200]   I'm differential to you.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.200]   - Right, but they're, okay, rigid hierarchies.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.480]   - Forced hierarchies is the--
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.520]   - Forced hierarchies, forced hierarchies, okay.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:00.120]   So do you think it's possible that humans,
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:03.120]   when left on their own accord,
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.000]   they form hierarchies naturally?
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.200]   - Yes, inevitably in my opinion.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.040]   - Inevitably.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.640]   - Which is why I disagree with the left anarchists.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.240]   I think it's not a coherent thing to argue
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.880]   for non-hierarchical relationships, even in theory.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.080]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:19.320]   And I know the old school anarchists
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.000]   will call me stupid or uninformed,
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.720]   but I've never been able to even wrap my head
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.440]   around this claim that you could have relationships
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.680]   without hierarchy.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:28.880]   - Right, so I guess there's a certain sense
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.920]   in which we're living in anarchism now.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.360]   And I don't mean just like because the nations,
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.800]   as you've said, are in anarchism relative to each other.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.440]   But isn't the United States just a collective
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.600]   that was formed in anarchy?
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.440]   And this is just the collective that we're operating under,
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.680]   this hierarchy that was naturally formed.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.640]   - Well, the United States was not naturally formed.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.720]   It was formed by force and by fiat.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:56.720]   But to your point, I stress this throughout the book.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:59.040]   I always say this anarchism is not a location,
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.360]   it's a relationship.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.280]   So yeah, you and I do have a hierarchy
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.840]   in that this is your show, but neither of us
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.560]   really has an authority over the other.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.460]   Like I'm here voluntarily, you can kick me out if you want.
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:10.560]   I can leave it anywhere.
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.280]   Neither of us has the power to force the other
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.840]   to be in this relationship we've chosen.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:17.340]   My lawyer, I defer to his judgment.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.560]   He's not forcing me to do it.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.760]   He gives me his advice and I can take it or leave it.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.840]   Same with the doctor.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.760]   So there is a clearly like who's in charge
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.800]   and who's not in charge, but they're not in a position
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.520]   to impose their will on everybody else.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.960]   And you could very easily see John is Stephanie's lawyer
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.840]   and Stephanie is John's doctor.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.680]   And in each of those contexts, one has this position
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.360]   of ostensible authority over the other.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:42.380]   So anarchism is in fact not some utopian crazy thing.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.180]   It is the norm of human relationships
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:47.840]   where you meet people, you're not necessarily equal.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.660]   Someone's gonna be taller, someone's gonna be stronger,
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.820]   someone's smarter, wealthier with others,
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:55.120]   but you're not at all thinking I am here
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.860]   and I could tell you what to do
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.880]   and you are legally or morally obligated
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.060]   to follow my wishes.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.180]   That is the basis of anarchism.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.500]   - So in what way is the United States imposing
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:09.360]   by force something on you, do you think?
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.700]   - If you leave your house, you will go to jail.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:15.560]   My money being taken from you via taxation.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:19.360]   - But don't you have the freedom to not operate under that?
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.080]   - No, but that's like, yeah, like technically
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.800]   if someone comes up to you and mugs you
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:26.040]   and says your money or your life, you are making a choice.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.640]   But what the anarchist argument is,
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.880]   they're not in a position to force you to make that choice.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.760]   That is not morally binding,
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.100]   even though they have practically the power
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:37.160]   to force you into that dilemma.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.240]   - But you have the freedom to live
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.880]   under the United States or not.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.320]   So even--
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.200]   - I see, yeah, the argument is if you don't like it, leave.
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.040]   Right?
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.800]   - Not necessarily leave like geographically,
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.480]   but there's ways to live outside
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.200]   the force of the United States.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.360]   There's ways, it's just very difficult to operate that way.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.200]   - But that's like saying you could outrun the mugger,
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.480]   which is true, but the issue is does that mugger
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.860]   have the right to tell you at gunpoint,
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:09.200]   you're either giving me your money or I'm gonna shoot you
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.260]   or secret plan C, you get to run away.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.500]   Is that person a moral actor?
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.420]   And the anarchist answer is never.
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:18.420]   And the difference, just one more thing,
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:21.140]   the anarchist view is the difference between that mugger
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:25.220]   and the government is only an air of legitimacy.
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:27.140]   Literally, they're morally identical.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:30.500]   - So is it possible that every hierarchy
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:33.040]   that gets big enough and successful enough
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.740]   such that it can monopolize a bunch of services it provides,
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:42.240]   isn't it always going to be amoral in your sense
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.460]   the way the United States government is amoral?
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:45.980]   - Well, I don't wanna say just like
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.160]   the United States government is amoral
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.780]   'cause that implies the United States government
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.460]   is uniquely or especially amoral.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:51.300]   - Right, governments have--
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.700]   - I just wanna clarify that 'cause I know
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:53.820]   you didn't mean that and I don't want that
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.920]   to be the implication.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.420]   Can you repeat the question, I'm sorry.
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:00.460]   - So like won't every--
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:01.300]   - Okay, so that's right.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:03.260]   So that's progressive economics.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.900]   So the argument is in any market at a certain point
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.460]   things tend to centralize and then that organization
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:12.420]   de facto can dictate price, can dictate so on and so forth.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.660]   That is completely historical.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.020]   If you look at any market,
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:19.140]   the trend is always towards decentralization,
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.280]   the music industry, right?
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.420]   When we were kids, there were four or five record labels.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.940]   They were the ones who made all the songs
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.380]   that you're gonna see in the Billboard Top 100
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:27.500]   with a few exceptions.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.060]   Now anyone can go to direct to market.
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.520]   If you look at TV stations, right?
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.980]   It went from CBS, NBC, ABC, then you got Fox,
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.580]   then you had cable which is 100.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.680]   Now you have satellite which have sounds around the world
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.620]   and you have YouTube which is literally infinite.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.780]   So as technology improves and as wealth increases
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:45.700]   which is a function of free enterprise,
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.780]   you are going to always have more and more choice
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.600]   even within a monopoly, Coca-Cola, right?
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.100]   This is an example I used I think in the new right.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.900]   When we were kids, every terrible comedian would be like,
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:02.100]   oh, now they've got diet caffeine free Coke, what's next?
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.840]   It's like, yeah, that's good.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.900]   You want to have, what was his name?
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:08.860]   Kamin, the guy who invented the Segway.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:10.260]   If you go, Dean Kamin,
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.760]   if you go into some restaurants right now,
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.860]   you will have those machines.
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.900]   We have like 80 kinds of Cokes
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:19.700]   and then you could have whatever flavor you want to add
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.600]   to a grape, cherry, lemon, lime, so on and so forth.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.460]   So in any field, you're going to have
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.100]   more and more competition.
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:30.360]   You're going to have less competition and less choices
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.800]   when the state gets involved
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.640]   because the state wants control.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.980]   The state wants one big neck with one leash around it
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:38.580]   and that way it could just pull that dog
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:39.880]   in one direction or another.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.500]   And you saw this last year with the lockdowns.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.300]   Carol Roth wrote this amazing book
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.900]   called "The War on Small Business"
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:47.820]   and she talked about we have seen
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.680]   for the first time in history,
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.940]   a massive wealth transfer from small and medium business
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.260]   towards organizations like Target and Amazon
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:59.060]   who made trillions of dollars last year.
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.260]   Whereas mom and pop, which to me at least
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:03.540]   is like the Acme of American achievement.
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:07.000]   You come to America, you have a fruit stand, a laundromat,
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.180]   you make socks, whatever it is,
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:11.740]   you're that unique artisan creating something special.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.300]   They're the ones who didn't last,
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.740]   whereas Target and Amazon did.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.500]   So when you have the state involvement,
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.420]   it will always be in favor of Jeff Bezos.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.920]   And for the simple reason that
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.040]   it's gonna be a lot easier for Jeff Bezos
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.760]   to get Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell on the phone
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.640]   than it is for me making socks on Etsy.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.920]   - But your sense is that there'll be less and less
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.240]   over time Jeff Bezos is,
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.680]   like whatever the industry will look at,
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.560]   there's be less, there's a trend towards decentralization
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.920]   across all industries.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.600]   - And when I say decentralization, I just mean choice.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.840]   So if you look at, again, networks,
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.840]   you're gonna, if you were in the 80s
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:53.040]   and you had a network just for LGBT issues,
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.180]   first of all, it's gonna be complete heretical,
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.340]   that's not gonna happen.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.820]   And there's not gonna be enough necessarily
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:38:59.560]   people identifies that to have an audience.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.560]   Then there was something called Logo, they had that.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.560]   And there's lots of other shows like that in this way.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.680]   So more specific, look at websites.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.640]   I'm positive that you and I,
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:12.220]   if we wanted to look up breeding guinea pigs,
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:15.260]   would find thousands of websites about different breeds
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.560]   and all this other stuff.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.160]   20 years ago, 30 years ago,
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.200]   like you're gonna have two books.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:21.480]   And they're not gonna be dynamic
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:24.480]   as these new breeds are developed.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.160]   - So at the same time, it does,
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.440]   following on your argument,
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.880]   it does seem easier to move and immigrate
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.440]   from state to state within the United States
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.000]   and to other countries.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.700]   Do you think that's a form of freedom
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.160]   that embodies anarchism,
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.020]   where you can resist the force of state
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:47.520]   by choosing where you live?
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.240]   - To some extent, but the line people,
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.920]   some of these boomers will go at me on Twitter,
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.400]   if I'm going after the police or something,
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.700]   and be like, if you don't like America, get out of here.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.840]   And I tell them, freedom means I do what I want,
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.680]   not what you want.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:02.800]   Freedom means I don't have to move, you don't have to move.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.080]   Free speech is a good example.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.760]   It doesn't mean I have to be on Twitter, right?
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.080]   Twitter has the right to ban me.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:07.900]   But what I'm saying is,
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:11.320]   if I'm saying something and you don't like it, too bad.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.440]   You're the one who has to accommodate me
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.240]   because I have a right to do what I want
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.040]   with my person as long as I'm being peaceful.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.420]   - So I guess I'm trying to get to the difference
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:25.420]   between the state and what you would naturally want
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:28.900]   in anarchy, which is like a security company.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:29.740]   - Sure.
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:34.300]   - All those things, they will, as they become successful,
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.440]   start looking more and more like the state.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:39.440]   Because you get to elect, you give them money.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.540]   - I got you.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.360]   - They have leaders.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.640]   What's the difference between a government
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:50.640]   and a very successful service provider in anarchism?
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.400]   - This gets a little confused in America
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.560]   as big companies necessarily are hand in hand
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.520]   with the government, ended up in bed with them.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:00.000]   The answer to this question is a long, complicated one,
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.280]   and thankfully it's all in the Anarchist Handbook.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.080]   There was an essay by Murray Rothbard, who Dave Smith,
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.840]   this is the essay that converted Dave Smith,
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.360]   so maybe it's not as good as it could have been otherwise,
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.000]   called Anatomy of the State.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.920]   And Murray Rothbard points out that state
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:15.800]   is the only agency in a country
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:18.520]   which gets its goods through force.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.080]   The state is the only agency that is not a producer,
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.760]   but inherently a parasite,
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.280]   because it does not get its money voluntarily,
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.900]   but through taxation and by imposing its values
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:29.860]   on a country.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.520]   That is what makes a state uniquely different
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.400]   from let's suppose an Amazon or a Barnes & Noble
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.280]   or a Target.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.820]   Jeff Bezos does not have the authority
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:42.760]   or the moral legitimacy to get an army
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.120]   and go into somebody's house,
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:47.640]   whereas Andrew Cuomo or Ron DeSantis,
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.040]   Donald Trump and Barack Obama certainly do.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.360]   - But is it possible that to reframe,
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.640]   so Jeff Bezos does if he hires a security force.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.600]   - Right.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.080]   - Also, is it possible to reframe taxation
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.280]   as a form of payment?
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.620]   If it was done much better,
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:11.560]   if you could pay this collective that we call government
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:15.020]   in ways where you could pay for things that you care for.
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:19.400]   So much, your money would be much more directly contributing
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.720]   to the things you care for.
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:23.400]   Whether if you care for a service like healthcare,
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.840]   you'll be able to buy essentially insurance
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.040]   from the government.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.640]   - Why am I buying insurance from the government
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.520]   as opposed to insurance from an insurance company?
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.760]   What do you perceive as the difference
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.080]   between a tax and a price?
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.600]   Do you see the difference?
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.440]   - Yes, I know on the surface level,
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:39.060]   I'm trying to get deeply to say
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:40.860]   there's a lot of similarities.
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:44.140]   - But what I'm saying is there's one essential difference,
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:48.740]   which is taxes are imposed on you and you have no choice.
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:52.300]   Here's an example, my book "Ego and Hubris", my biography,
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.260]   it goes for $500 on eBay, someone paid for it,
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:55.580]   some crazy person.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:58.780]   People were showing me that it's on Amazon for $3,000,
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:42:59.860]   something like that.
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.300]   You could put a million for it.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:03.100]   You could charge whatever price you want.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.460]   The question is, is someone paying that 3,000 for it?
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:07.280]   Is someone paying that million for it?
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:10.340]   It's actually the buyer who establishes the price
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:12.780]   because the seller can put any price tag he wants,
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:15.660]   $80 trillion, but unless someone's paying that amount
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:17.120]   and clearing the market,
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.500]   that price has literally no real meaning.
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:22.020]   It's not an indicator of value or worth or market price.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:25.260]   Taxation on the other hand is by fiat.
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:29.460]   I can decide it's fair that you Lex have to pay 40%
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.940]   and Joe has to pay 45%.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:34.060]   Joe and Lex are in no position to be like,
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:35.940]   this price is too high.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:38.300]   Not only is that money set
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.160]   just completely out of their hands,
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.220]   for people who are employees,
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:46.100]   it's taken out of their paychecks before they even see it.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:48.220]   They don't even have the choice to be like, you know what?
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.700]   I agree that the government has the right to pay taxation.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.860]   Here's my check for 40%, it's going on.
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:55.260]   It's a completely different paradigm
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:56.100]   than you are when you're paying for price.
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:58.740]   - But the government provides a lot of services
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.060]   in the current system.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.260]   - Right, but there's no service the government provides
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:05.140]   that would not be provided better, more efficiently
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.620]   and with more choices in a market.
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.060]   - Well, that's a hypothesis.
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:09.060]   - No, that's-- - Very likely.
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:10.100]   No, that's not--
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:12.160]   - I can demonstrate it to you very easily.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.380]   I love it when you get flustered.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:17.860]   This is what people like.
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:18.920]   It's so cute.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.980]   The robot--
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.660]   - Don't make me put on the hat again.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.100]   - The robot has the fire,
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.180]   the smoke coming out of his ears.
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.400]   What is price?
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:31.420]   - Okay, so-- - I will tax love.
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.580]   - You know, people like,
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:36.980]   I think of the government as a kind of subscription service.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.740]   - No, no, that's the anarchist view.
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.420]   The anarchist view of private security
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:42.660]   would be a subscription service.
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:44.060]   So that's exactly correct.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:48.100]   - But everyone hates when you sign up to a gym
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:50.080]   and then you realize in the contract,
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.940]   it's very difficult to cancel that membership
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:54.260]   and then they up the price.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.780]   I mean, there's a lot of unpleasant things
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:59.260]   with a subscription service
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:02.500]   that then you can elect to go to another subscription service
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:05.580]   - Or you could go on Yelp and complain
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.740]   and if there's enough people to do that,
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.020]   the gym will be receptive.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:10.900]   Look at the power of Yelp versus the power of the vote.
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:13.300]   - Well, we could talk about that too.
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:18.300]   So you're saying Yelp is more effective than voting.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.260]   - Yes.
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:22.380]   - The thing is, I agree with you,
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:25.260]   but you take a further step.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:29.340]   You say that Yelp is ethical and moral
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:32.140]   and voting is amoral or like not voting,
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:34.480]   but government is amoral.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:37.500]   So like, it's not only is one more efficient than the other,
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.100]   you're saying like, 'cause I would say government sucks
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:44.300]   at doing what it does and has gotten a lot better at it.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.340]   And I believe it can keep getting better
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:52.060]   as it gets smaller and leverages companies more and more.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.580]   But you're saying, no, no, no,
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.820]   government is fundamentally as an idea,
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:00.420]   gets in the way of companies
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.140]   that should be doing those things anyway.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.820]   I just think that companies,
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:05.860]   when you take away government,
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:08.140]   will start looking like government.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:09.660]   - Just 'cause something looks like something
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.460]   does not mean it's the same.
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.860]   If someone puts out a yarmulke to fill in
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.860]   and they go to shul, they're not Jewish.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:17.940]   - Right.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:20.260]   The basic objection you have with government,
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:21.180]   'cause you can leave,
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.780]   I apologize that this is that stupid Twitter cliche
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:30.460]   statement, but your opposition to this idea
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:34.260]   of leaving the United States is that it's just,
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:35.380]   it's a lot of effort.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:37.460]   It's too much friction.
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:38.660]   - That's not the option.
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:42.020]   The opposition is, in the introduction to the book,
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:44.740]   I say anarchism can be summed up in one sentence.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:46.180]   You do not speak for me.
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:47.740]   Everything else is application.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:50.700]   So the claim that somebody I've never met
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.540]   or who I voted against, let's say,
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:55.380]   I hate Donald Trump, I despise him.
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.940]   I want Hillary Clinton to be president.
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.620]   Too bad, Trump's your president.
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:59.860]   That's not what I want.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:02.180]   The idea that this person can come on me
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:05.100]   and make any claims onto one second of my time,
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:07.020]   as opposed to trying to persuade me,
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.300]   that is something that I, an anarchist,
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:12.740]   regard as inherently evil and nonsensical.
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:15.260]   - But to operate large organizations,
[01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:18.140]   like you see this with cryptocurrency, there's governance,
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.020]   you have to make difficult decisions.
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.580]   There's a block size wars for Bitcoin.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:25.180]   So you will, there is a voting mechanism often
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.340]   with membership when you're a subscription service.
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:29.980]   - But see, the thing is you're using these words
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:31.460]   and you're switching definitions.
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:34.460]   Because if I go to a store, I can technically say
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:36.180]   I'm voting for Tropicana orange juice
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:37.620]   as opposed to another one.
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:40.340]   But to kind of say, oh, well, you're making a choice,
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.860]   therefore every choice is a vote.
[01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:44.740]   I think that that's something that the Venn diagram is not.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:47.420]   - No, I literally mean vote in this case, not money.
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:49.100]   There's some decisions,
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.860]   like should Bitcoin have increases block size?
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:54.940]   There's a bunch of different,
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.900]   they're called soft forks or hard forks.
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:59.100]   - Oh, I'm not saying you should never vote.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:00.940]   Like stockholders have to vote, right?
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.940]   - Exactly. - But there's no pretense.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:04.300]   Here's, let's look at this.
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:06.180]   If you wanna build robots, right?
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.540]   You would sit down with the company,
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.660]   you guys would be like, we should do this kind of robot,
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.740]   we should do this kind of robot.
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:13.260]   The stockholders would have a vote or the board
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.580]   in proportion to their investment in the firm.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:18.140]   Me, who knows nothing about robots,
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:21.820]   the idea that I'm in a position to walk in
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:23.820]   and be like, this is what you should do
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:26.180]   is crazy and bizarre and wrong
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.900]   'cause I'm not in an informed position.
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:30.660]   So what democracy does is it forces people
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:34.380]   who run businesses well to run businesses poorly
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.820]   by people who don't know how to run businesses at all.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:39.060]   That's one of the many concerns.
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.340]   - But you're saying that's the fundamental property
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.220]   of the state.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.660]   I have a sense that the state could become
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:47.820]   as effective as what we think of as companies.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:50.060]   I mean, as-- - This is why they can't
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:53.220]   because the state does not have access to data
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:54.820]   the way that firms do.
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:57.420]   And this is one of Ludwig von Mises' great points,
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.540]   what he called the calculation problem.
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:01.900]   If I'm looking at comic books, right?
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.780]   And I have detective comics.
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.620]   If detective comics 26 is 1,000
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:09.100]   and detective comics 28 is 1,000
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:12.300]   and detective comics 27 is 50,000,
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:14.860]   that is telling me that even if I don't know anything
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:17.900]   about comics, that detective comics 27
[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:20.140]   is either very, very scarce for some reason
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:21.500]   or very, very desirable.
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.140]   It's the first appearance of Batman, whatever,
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:25.500]   but you don't need to know that to just look at this data
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:28.460]   and be like, okay, this is the market, tell me something.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:30.500]   If prices are set by the government,
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.300]   which the government is a monopoly,
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:35.260]   I have no way of picking those winners or losers.
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:37.660]   I don't have that data of supply and demand
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:39.860]   of an entire nation or a world
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.100]   of people making individual decisions
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:44.140]   and having price be dynamic
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:47.220]   and informing me as the organization
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:49.260]   where I should allocate my resources.
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:52.860]   - So the price is a really strong signal
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:57.860]   that allows you to operate a voluntary collective
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.700]   where people get what they want
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.460]   and don't get what they don't want.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:04.340]   - And it tells me what to produce, what not to produce.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:07.820]   And it also is great because if I see this podcasting
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:09.700]   industry which didn't exist five years ago
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.340]   and now these people are making bank,
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:14.660]   that tells me as someone who's an investor,
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:17.180]   okay, they're making 50%, whatever,
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.140]   10% profit on their capital.
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:22.140]   In the plant industry, it's 2%.
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.620]   If I'm going to further my capital into this 10%
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:28.900]   and that's gonna lower the profit rate as that builds up
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.380]   and that is how markets are regulated voluntarily.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:34.100]   - But the word government,
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.020]   I just think it's possible to have collectives
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:40.540]   that of human beings that represent others
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:43.420]   based on their voluntary--
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.220]   - Yes, of course, you have private governance.
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:46.420]   - Right, private governance.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.420]   - Any company, you can have a CEO,
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.940]   you can have a board of directors.
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:54.940]   - But then you, I just, it starts to look very similar to me
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:59.020]   a successful private governance mechanism
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.860]   at a scale of the United States
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:03.880]   starts looking a whole lot like
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.080]   the current government of the United States.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:10.020]   - What's, even Amazon I don't think is anything close
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.340]   to the federal budget. - Size-wise.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:13.340]   - Size-wise or budget-wise or power-wise.
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:17.700]   - No, so you're saying you just, it's not even state,
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:19.580]   it's almost like anything at that size,
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:21.420]   you want to keep things smaller.
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:26.420]   - And I don't, markets are not going to combine
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:28.540]   to that level of the state because no,
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:30.920]   Jeff Bezos will never be in a position
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.620]   to tell everyone in America,
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:35.500]   I'm gonna take 40% of your money before you even see it.
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.340]   - That to me is actually unclear.
[01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:38.700]   We don't know that to be true,
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:41.820]   where that Google or Amazon can't grow to the size,
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.540]   if you take away the US government,
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:46.300]   I'm not so sure that Amazon can't grow to the size--
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:48.060]   - Okay, so worst case scenario
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:49.960]   is we're back where we started, right?
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:54.780]   - That's not worst case scenario.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:56.820]   - But the concern is that Google
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.500]   is gonna be the federal government?
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:51:59.860]   - That's not the concern, I'm saying like,
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.220]   this is what it looks like
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:02.540]   when Google is the federal government.
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:05.820]   It's not, it's like, to me,
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:09.300]   the US government is our best attempt so far
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.340]   to have large scale representation of people's interest.
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:15.540]   It really sucks, but it's our best attempt so far.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.300]   And the question is how to improve it.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:19.220]   Like, if you take away all,
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:20.900]   if you take away the US government,
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:23.500]   I'm trying to see how do we improve
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:27.180]   on that level, that scale of representation
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:28.000]   of people's interest.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:28.840]   - Let me give you one example
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:30.780]   that people could wrap their heads around very easily.
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:32.540]   I'm against government police monopoly,
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:34.700]   I'm for private security, right?
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:37.020]   You don't have to be an anarchist to understand this.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:40.440]   Can everyone agree, or at least as a hypothesis,
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.580]   everyone can wrap their heads around,
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:45.020]   here's a big concern, 911, right?
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:47.240]   I've heard this 911 call, it's very chilling.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:48.300]   There's a kid in a closet,
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.060]   his family's being murdered outside, right?
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.600]   He has to call 911, he's whispering.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.700]   It's horrifying to hear.
[01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:56.860]   There's no reason why the number I call
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:58.900]   for my family's being murdered
[01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:00.940]   is the same number I call for the fire department,
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:02.500]   is the same number I call for an ambulance.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.560]   What if instead it operated like Uber?
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:05.940]   You had buttons on your phone.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:09.380]   If there's a real emergency, like someone's gun flyers,
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:11.100]   someone's being killed, you press this,
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:14.540]   and it sends instead of the one police district,
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:17.420]   whatever company is nearby, you have a bunch of them,
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:18.660]   and they're the ones who are gonna come
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:19.900]   to your house to save you.
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:22.100]   People can wrap their heads around that very easily.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.580]   That is one very clear way to go
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:26.940]   from having a government security monopoly
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:29.540]   towards having a more free enterprise system.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:31.800]   So when you apply that to pretty much anything,
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:34.260]   it doesn't become that complicated of alternative.
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:38.820]   - So what I would, you're gonna criticize this,
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:41.980]   but I believe the government,
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:44.100]   it's like the parenting thing we've talked about earlier.
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:49.100]   I think it creates a safe space for--
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:51.100]   - I'm for safe spaces,
[01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:52.860]   so I'm not gonna laugh at you about that.
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:53.900]   I want people to be safe.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:57.220]   - But for a safe space for entrepreneurship.
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:00.660]   So I believe that good government,
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:02.300]   hold on a sec, give me a sec.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:04.220]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right, I'm sorry.
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:09.020]   I think government gives opportunity
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:11.100]   for companies to out-compete it.
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:16.100]   - Yes, UPS, FedEx, 100%, not a question.
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:19.620]   - So I believe you need to have government
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:24.900]   to give a chance for UPS, FedEx, for SpaceX,
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:28.480]   oh, there's an X in there, to pop up,
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.140]   and then government will naturally back off from that place.
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:34.660]   So like, but you need the innovators
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:36.140]   to step in and build the thing.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:36.980]   - Okay.
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:37.820]   - Like you can't just--
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.760]   - When has government ever backed off though?
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.220]   That never happens.
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:45.580]   - Back, well, from what, from FedEx and UPS,
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:48.740]   from SpaceX, from Amazon.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:50.540]   - Hold on, the US Postal Service
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:52.660]   still competes with FedEx and UPS,
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:53.620]   so here's the other thing.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:54.940]   - Not nearly--
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.220]   - Not well, but they still exist.
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:57.740]   And the point is UPS-- - They're dying.
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:00.740]   - But UPS and FedEx are taxed,
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:02.980]   so not only are they paying for their own company,
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.220]   they're paying for this competitor.
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:05.780]   This is the essential difference.
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:08.100]   Imagine if you didn't have UPS,
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:10.260]   excuse me, the federal government, no post office.
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:11.740]   So you had FedEx, you have DHL,
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:13.820]   you have US Postal Service and many others.
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:18.300]   How about in this scenario, UPS has the capacity
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:22.580]   to take 20% of FedEx's DHL and Courier's money
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:23.620]   and put it in their own pocket
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:25.140]   and they never have to do anything in return.
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:28.060]   This is gonna be an enormous advantage of UPS,
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.440]   and then when you add the addition
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.180]   that UPS is not necessarily gonna be more efficient
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:34.140]   than the others, this is gonna be a huge distortion
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:35.220]   in the market.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:36.620]   Can you imagine if your podcast,
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.620]   you just automatically got 20% of the views
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.580]   of everybody else?
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:42.540]   I mean, would there be any incentive for you to be great?
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:43.680]   Or you could just sit in your laurels
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.820]   and do whatever you want, even more than now?
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:47.060]   (laughing)
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.820]   - It's hard to imagine more than now.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:51.380]   - That's 'cause you're a robot and lack imagination.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:54.060]   - I think there just has to be,
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:56.180]   of course you can do it completely without government,
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:57.420]   but government-- - That's all I need to hear.
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:55:58.540]   Okay, that's all I need to hear.
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:55:59.980]   - Show's over. - Show's over.
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:01.180]   - Of course you can do it without government.
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:02.780]   - The question-- - Let us try.
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:05.540]   - The question is, that safety net
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:07.180]   that's needed for entrepreneurship,
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:10.420]   that's needed for, I'm sorry to say,
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:12.620]   but I have a sense that there needs to be
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:14.580]   a bit of a safety net for freedom.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:17.020]   - I'm much more comfortable with saying
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:18.420]   you need a safety net for freedom
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:20.180]   than you need one for entrepreneurs.
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:22.980]   The beauty of markets is, with your startup,
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:25.740]   if you have a startup and it completely fails,
[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:28.380]   the only person who's screwed is you and your investors.
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.420]   If I'm a government and I make a startup,
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:32.660]   the entire society fails, like the Iraq War.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:35.260]   If I have this cockamamie plan,
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:36.460]   everyone else doesn't have a choice.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:38.100]   They are both funding it and sometimes
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:40.340]   you get drafted or forced into it.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:42.400]   The safety net, the antlers,
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:43.740]   getting back to the early anarchists,
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:46.100]   one of the things that I admire about them,
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:48.780]   the anarcho-communists, the old school left anarchists,
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.580]   is people don't remember what context they were in.
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:53.660]   They were in context without a welfare state.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:56.220]   They're immigrating in huge numbers from Eastern Europe.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.420]   People are, you go to the Tenement Museum in New York,
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:56:59.900]   people are like 12 to a room.
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.380]   Kids are working in factories.
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:02.620]   If they're either working in factories
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:03.460]   or they have to starve,
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:04.940]   it's not that their parents didn't love them,
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:06.540]   it's that the parents didn't have birth control,
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:09.100]   which was a felony, and they also were in a position
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.420]   to put food on the table for their kids
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:13.100]   'cause they're uneducated and the jobs are paying nothing.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:14.820]   So you could understand why Emma Goldman,
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:18.140]   Alexander Berkman, Proudhon, and all these other figures
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:19.720]   were like, this is untenable.
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:22.720]   We see Carnegie with 80,000 mansions,
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:26.520]   whereas this lady whose husband died at age 30,
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:29.680]   who's never been to high school or even junior high school,
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:32.320]   has 10 kids, how's she gonna put food on the table?
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:33.280]   It's not gonna happen.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:35.000]   You can understand why they would be like,
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.740]   all right, we need to seize this money
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:37.860]   and distribute it around the people.
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:39.080]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:42.740]   In a contemporary context where food is much cheaper,
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:45.760]   where shelter to some extent is more available,
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.760]   when medical care, people, we're so oblivious
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:53.880]   to how bad things were that we see things are bad now,
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.100]   so we assume that they were better than in some context,
[01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:58.600]   they were much, much worse there in many contexts.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.400]   So if you're gonna make an argument for government,
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:04.760]   for me, the strongest argument is like food stamps
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:07.080]   or like free lunches for children
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:10.080]   because I agree that would be very inefficient
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:11.960]   and it's gonna probably make them obese
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:14.560]   because you're gonna have Nabisco lobbying
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.960]   to make sure that if you're gonna have this protein,
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.700]   you're not gonna give the kids an Oreo, aren't you?
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:21.200]   These kids are poor.
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:22.800]   You want them to have some pleasure
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.680]   and that's gonna have deleterious effects,
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:27.360]   but if the choice is an inefficient government program
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:30.720]   and mass starvation, that is one where as an anarchist,
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:33.680]   I could easily see making the argument for that one.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:38.000]   Even though I think very clearly private charity
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.180]   would be more efficient and distributed more effectively,
[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:42.680]   but at that point, I don't really care about efficiency.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.080]   If you're throwing out food
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:46.520]   to make sure these kids get fed, I don't care.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:50.040]   - So would engagement in military conflict
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:53.020]   be one of the biggest negative things
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:55.980]   about the state to you?
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:56.820]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:00.020]   War is the state at its worst.
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:01.940]   - So if we take away war-
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:04.740]   - Or make it defensive instead of aggressive.
[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:07.060]   Yeah, I mean, wouldn't that be a huge step forward?
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:08.740]   If war instead of regarded,
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.940]   we're always, this is what drives me crazy.
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:14.840]   We're taught as kids in school that war is a last resort
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:16.380]   and I agree with that.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.800]   And yet when you look at the corporate press,
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.440]   war is always the first response.
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:26.440]   And these people do not talk about what war means.
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:29.180]   They'll show examples during the Bush years
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:31.260]   of soldiers coming home in caskets,
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:34.520]   which already is an unacceptable price in many cases for me,
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:37.600]   but they don't even pretend to care about the people
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:40.020]   overseas whose countries we've ransacked
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:41.540]   and lives we've ruined.
[01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:42.860]   And it's just like, well, what are you gonna do?
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:44.460]   Not ransack those countries?
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:49.180]   So that war to me is the state at its worst.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:53.500]   - See, I think that there's value from small government
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:55.180]   that doesn't engage in wars.
[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:58.340]   I do think that the kind of collectives
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:00.140]   that you imagine functioning well
[02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:03.140]   would look like the best version of government
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.140]   that I imagine.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:04.980]   So- - Okay, great.
[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:06.540]   What a great endorsement.
[02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:07.980]   - Well, I see them as the same.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:08.820]   - Okay, fine.
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:10.980]   - I think a lot of it is just terminology.
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:14.040]   - I have no problem saying that I'm using the word anarchism
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.380]   incorrectly and to go for what you want.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:19.420]   - I have no problem with that or anything really,
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:21.220]   'cause like I said, life is beautiful,
[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:25.580]   but nevertheless, you wrote the essay,
[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:29.540]   "Why I'm Not Going to Vote This Time or Ever."
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:31.980]   - Yeah, "Why I Won't Vote This Year or Any Other Year."
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:32.820]   - Or Any Year.
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:35.700]   And the basic idea- - I hope you do a better job
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:37.580]   reading it than you just read that title.
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:39.940]   I guess you'll take as many takes as necessary.
[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:43.320]   - I'll read it in Russian
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.480]   and then pay somebody to translate it.
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:49.960]   - This isn't even Russian at all, he's just making up words.
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:51.260]   Where'd you find this guy?
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:55.080]   - You get what you pay for. - He has this podcast.
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:56.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.340]   - This is anarchy.
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:01.460]   - This is what you wanted.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:06.680]   - Like your basic summary is, let me see.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.080]   "If pressed, the simplest explanation I have
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:11.020]   "for refusing to vote is this.
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:14.000]   "I don't vote for the same exact reasons
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.100]   "that I don't take communion.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:20.200]   "No matter how admirable he is or how much I agree with him,
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.420]   "the Pope isn't the steward over my soul,
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:26.060]   "nor is any president the leader of my life.
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:30.100]   "This does not make me ignorant or evil
[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.720]   "any more than not being a Christian
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.460]   "makes me ignorant or evil.
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.040]   "If I need representation,
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.720]   "I will hire the most qualified person to do so."
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:38.560]   - Yeah.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:42.180]   - Isn't voting our current best developed way
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:43.820]   of hiring the most qualified person
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:45.660]   to represent you on some things?
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:48.660]   - No, because if I have a lawyer
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:50.860]   and the lawyer screws up, I can fire him.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:53.520]   If I vote for someone, I don't get who I want.
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:55.220]   I get for who my neighbors want.
[02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:57.020]   So that makes no sense.
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:00.660]   Representation means I want you to speak for me,
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:03.080]   whereas voting is like, I kind of want you,
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.360]   but I'll take what I can get.
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:06.280]   And I'm gonna take what I could get regardless,
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.020]   so what's the point?
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:11.620]   - In governance, again, that's what Bitcoin is.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:14.820]   You want to be represented in deciding what to do,
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:15.660]   but once--
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:17.620]   - Wait, Bitcoin isn't picking a person.
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:19.780]   They're not picking a president of Bitcoin.
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:20.860]   - They're picking an idea.
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.420]   - Yeah, it's more like a referendum.
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:23.260]   - Right.
[02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:26.860]   - And to me, a referendum is much more coherent
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:29.820]   and defensible than it is voting for representative
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:32.380]   because if I'm voting for Joe Biden,
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:35.220]   I'm saying this person speaks to me for abortion,
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:38.380]   taxation, environmental policy, immigration, war, right?
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:40.520]   The odds that unless you're a complete NPC
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.460]   that this one person will speak for you for everything
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:45.740]   and will deliver what he promised
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:48.180]   and has the power to deliver what he promised is not true.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:52.320]   Whereas if I have Brexit, if I say I want Britain
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:54.100]   to remain part of the European Union,
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:55.580]   to say yes or no question,
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:57.740]   that makes a lot more sense to me.
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:59.940]   But even that is not pure democracy
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:02.740]   because going back to the idea of the circulation of elites,
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:04.440]   which James Burnham talked about,
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:06.280]   Pareto and Moscow and all them,
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:08.920]   you are still going to have someone telling you
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.520]   what you can and can't vote for
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.200]   and how these questions are framed.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:15.680]   So, contradiction to what the left anarchist said,
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:19.380]   some element of hierarchy is always going to be inevitable.
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:25.600]   - So, listen, I agree with this aspect very much
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:28.520]   so that we should be voting for ideas and issues,
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.980]   not voting for leaders,
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:32.200]   for leaders to represent us
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:34.400]   across the full spectrum of issues.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:36.440]   It seems to make no sense.
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:37.280]   - Okay, good.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.200]   Man, this is great.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:42.080]   - But I do think there should be a leader.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:46.280]   I do believe in voting for representatives to debate,
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.400]   to be communicators of ideas to us.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.480]   - But here's, let me, sorry to interrupt you,
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.680]   but you could have those two things.
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.400]   For example, wouldn't this be an improvement
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:55.760]   if they have that now?
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:56.800]   You have a referendum.
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.440]   Do you want tax rate to be 30 or 40, whatever percent?
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:01.800]   You have the guy leading the campaign for 50,
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:02.900]   fight for 50.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:04.840]   Then you have the lady leading the campaign for 40,
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:05.760]   fight for 40.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:06.720]   They'll go out there.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:07.880]   They can have debates.
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.200]   They can talk about the issue,
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:10.780]   but you're still not voting for one of them.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.140]   You're voting for the issue.
[02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:14.040]   That makes much more sense to me
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:15.360]   than I'm going to vote for him
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:16.960]   and hope that he puts forward 50
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.680]   and that depends on 99 other senators.
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:19.600]   - Exactly.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.840]   But also, I mean, I do like the idea of voting
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:23.640]   for certain people to debate certain ideas.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:25.560]   - Yes, I think that's a major improvement.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.920]   - But the final vote should be based on the idea.
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:29.200]   So, okay, so agree.
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.400]   That would be nice to have plus no wars
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:35.360]   and then you'll stop tweeting so aggressively.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:39.400]   - And to decriminalize things that don't hurt people.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:40.320]   - Drugs. - Victimist crimes.
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:42.960]   Drugs, especially prostitution is a big one.
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.760]   If there's, and this is me talking,
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:47.040]   Mr. All Cops Are Criminals.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:50.120]   There is no one or maybe other than like abused children
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:54.160]   who needs access to the police other than sex workers.
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:56.120]   They are the ones who are the most likely
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:58.480]   to really put themselves in danger situation.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:00.800]   So they need to be able to call security
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.160]   'cause that's why they have pimps
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.000]   because you're a woman dealing with some strange dudes
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.080]   who are a lot of the time gonna have weird kinks.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:09.880]   You wanna be able to be sure,
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.640]   even if you don't approve of prostitution,
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.600]   think it's horrible,
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:14.400]   that she's not gonna be raped and murdered
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.680]   and have no consequences.
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:16.520]   And if you're gonna say,
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:19.480]   oh, well, she's a prostitute, she can't be raped.
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:20.360]   Just think for a second,
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.560]   if you're agreeing to sleep with somebody
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:24.480]   and then he starts choking you and beating the crap out of you
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:26.320]   and saying, now it's a dumb situation,
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:28.960]   that is clearly beyond the pale of salt.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:33.400]   - And the same thing with drugs, heroin, cocaine, crack.
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:38.440]   The people that need help the most
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:39.880]   are the ones who are addicted to those drugs.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:41.320]   - But even the ones who need punishment,
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:42.880]   let's suppose you think drug dealers
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.600]   should be in jail, right?
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:49.600]   It is very hard for me to say that someone who sells cocaine
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.480]   should be treated or in the same building
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:55.240]   as someone who rapes children or is a murderer.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.080]   These are not similar types of evil,
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:06:00.280]   even if you believe that that drug dealer is an evil person.
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:01.120]   - Yeah, I have-
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.920]   - There's an essay in there by Alexander Berkman,
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:08.880]   who is Emma Goldman's partner on prisons and crime.
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:11.000]   And this is leftism at its best,
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.040]   forgetting the person who's forgotten.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:14.040]   And the fact that we have
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:16.080]   the world's largest prison population,
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.800]   the fact that so many people are just like,
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.200]   oh, you commit a crime, just put them in jail,
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:21.600]   throw away the key, at the very least,
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:24.160]   if you wanna be totally immoral about it, it's expensive.
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:26.840]   And second of all, the concept that all criminals
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:28.120]   should be locked in a room together
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:30.440]   in these kind of largely inhuman conditions,
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:31.880]   and that's gonna help people,
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:34.680]   I don't think that that's the ideal mechanism.
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:36.320]   - Yeah, I tend to believe,
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:39.440]   I usually don't speak so negatively about politicians,
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:44.400]   but I do think that politicians have done more evil
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.440]   in the war on drugs than did the people
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:49.040]   that are supposed to be the criminals in this picture.
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.440]   - And I'll give you another example
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:52.800]   of how this is the anarchist critique of power.
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:55.280]   Hunter Biden, and I'm not making fun of him,
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.200]   not taking shots at him,
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:59.040]   he had an article in "The New Yorker"
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.840]   where he talks about when he was in LA,
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:03.520]   he was buying crack and there was a misunderstanding,
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:05.800]   or he left the crack pipe in the Hertz car,
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:07.520]   and then blah, blah, there's an issue.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:11.000]   He's admitting to a felony in writing to a reporter,
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.880]   and I'm sure this was within the statute of limitations.
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:17.200]   There was no possibility he was gonna have consequences.
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:19.080]   Kamala Harris, who was a cop,
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:22.200]   talked about when she was in college, she was smoking weed,
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.560]   and it's like, I don't begrudge you guys
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:26.640]   smoking your crack or smoking your weed,
[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:29.360]   but for other people who are poor
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:31.840]   or maybe just had the short end of the stick,
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:35.120]   this is years of their life being destroyed.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.840]   At the very least, even arrest is a traumatic situation.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:41.160]   If you have a weed or cocaine or crack, you're arrested.
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:42.440]   That's really gonna screw up,
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.680]   it's gonna do a number on you being locked up.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.680]   So to have that double standard, to me,
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.640]   is completely unacceptable,
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.520]   and that has nothing to do with a Republican or Democrat.
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:55.200]   George W. Bush was a cokehead back in the day.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:57.000]   He talks about overcoming his addiction,
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.360]   and I'm glad that he did, more power to him.
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:01.440]   But just to have this kind of,
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.960]   it's just really kind of disturbing to me,
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:05.720]   and this is my anarchist brain,
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:08.040]   like how prevalent drug use is in college.
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:09.520]   I think it was a joke on South Park,
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:10.960]   there's a time and a place to try drugs,
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.920]   and that's called college, where people experiment.
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:14.280]   But all those college kids,
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:16.720]   which are gonna become next generation's elite,
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:19.880]   don't really have that worry that if they get caught,
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:21.480]   then anything's gonna happen to them.
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.400]   But that kid in the street,
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:24.960]   who did not have that good upbringing,
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:26.760]   even if he's a piece of crap,
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:28.760]   like he's not gonna have a different punishment.
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:32.220]   I think that's just really at his base on American.
[02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:35.640]   - So in contrast to Tolstoy,
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:37.040]   let me ask you about Emma Goldman.
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:41.500]   You wrote that if anarchism believed in rulers,
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:44.960]   then Emma Goldman would be the undisputed queen.
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.280]   - Yes.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:51.280]   - What ideas define her flavor of anarchism, would you say?
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:56.320]   - Emma was really an old school radical.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:58.840]   She was a radical among radicals.
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:08:59.880]   I don't know what ideas,
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:03.840]   I mean, what would ideas define her was anarchism, obviously.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:04.920]   - There's the violence.
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:09.320]   I mean, she was more open to the idea of violent opposition
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:11.520]   versus somebody like Tolstoy.
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.520]   - Oh, sure, for sure.
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:14.960]   So basically Emma and Alexander Berkman,
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:17.200]   their mentor was someone named Johann Most.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:20.600]   And Johann Most was a very early free speech,
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:22.640]   not very early, but he was a free speech concern
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:24.720]   'cause he published a pamphlet in Europe
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.440]   that was translated in the States
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.320]   about how to build dynamite.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.080]   Because his idea was, all right,
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:31.600]   you have this oppressive government,
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:33.260]   this oppressive police force
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:36.280]   that use batons and bolts against us.
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.360]   The only way for us as the working class
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:40.880]   to level the playing field is through dynamite,
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:42.280]   and here's how you build it.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.640]   So the question is, all right,
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:46.120]   is this something that could be allowed to be legal
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:47.800]   now that you're allowing the layman
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:50.200]   to in his own house build bombs?
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:55.200]   So Johann Most, basically they had a big parting of ways
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.960]   because when Alexander Berkman tried to assassinate Frick,
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:02.760]   Johann said, no, no, no, this is not something I'm for.
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.680]   And in fact, they thought with this assassination,
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:06.720]   this failed assassination,
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:09.440]   this would be the thing that's fired off the revolution
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.480]   'cause you had the strike, the Pinkertons undervile,
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:14.400]   Pinkertons getting killed, strikers are getting killed.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.840]   This was what Marx predicted.
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:17.360]   They're gonna light the spark
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:18.840]   and everything's gonna come falling down.
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:20.760]   He ends up going to jail for 13 years instead,
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:21.920]   Alexander Berkman does.
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.520]   And then Goldman and Berkman had a big issue
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:30.240]   because when Leon Salgaz killed McKinley in 1901,
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:32.640]   it was really, it's kind of humorous in retrospect.
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:33.800]   He gets arrested and they're like,
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:34.760]   why'd you kill the president?
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:37.040]   He goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman.
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:38.400]   And she's like, oh, damn it.
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:39.600]   So she's on the run.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.200]   She's like, I don't even know this guy.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.200]   And she made the point about like,
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:47.120]   why is it worse than the president being killed
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:49.080]   and somebody else, we're all equal.
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.480]   And you would think if you're against capitalism,
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:53.960]   against the ruling class, this would be your first target.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.960]   But Berkman who went to jail,
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:59.040]   who tried to assassinate someone,
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.160]   he had said, McKinley, this is your villain.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:03.480]   He's just a party hack.
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.480]   He's like a symptom of the times.
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:06.640]   This is foolish.
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:08.160]   And Goldman disagreed with him.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:11.400]   She thought it wasn't necessarily justified,
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.680]   but it may have done something that was defensible.
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:16.800]   So the three of them, you know,
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:19.200]   had their differences on the use of violence.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:21.640]   And in fact, when she came back from Russia
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.160]   and was denouncing it in her book,
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:24.240]   "My Disillusionment in Russia,"
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:25.600]   and "My Third Disillusionment in Russia,"
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:26.840]   the last chapter, she goes,
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:29.760]   look, I'm not saying I'm against violence.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:31.080]   When there's the revolution comes,
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:32.200]   we're gonna have to use force.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:35.160]   She goes, but it's not the force of the state
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.080]   against the working class, against the masses.
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.560]   This is exactly what we're opposed to.
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:41.800]   This is a complete obscenity to our principles.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.320]   So that was interesting.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:44.880]   The fact that she was,
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:48.200]   her periodical "Mother Earth" was a clearing house
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:51.160]   for many prominent, you know, ideas of the day
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:52.880]   that weren't anarchist, but were certainly radical.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:54.680]   So she was a bit, and also she was like tiny.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:55.840]   She was like 5'1".
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.800]   So to have this little woman who was so feisty and-
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:00.880]   - Talk back to Lennon.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.840]   - Talk back to Lennon.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.440]   She took on Lennon, Woodrow Wilson.
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:07.080]   J. Edgar Hoover was the one who deported her.
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.520]   Someone who just, and the thing is you have to be careful
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.640]   because I think just like war,
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:15.840]   it's very easy to glamorize violence
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.880]   and to regard it as something admirable or heroic,
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:20.480]   like you're fighting for the cause.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.520]   But if you take it out of the romanticism,
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:24.960]   you're like, you're killing someone who had kids.
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:27.200]   You are, you know, killing someone with a family.
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:29.880]   You're making your, if you're gonna shoot someone,
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:31.920]   they're probably gonna retaliate twice as hard.
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:33.560]   Violence sings its own song
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:35.600]   and this is a very dangerous road you're going down.
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:38.880]   So you really need to be careful
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:41.200]   about what you're preaching here.
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:44.080]   And, you know, she kind of had this mixed feelings about it,
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.520]   but that is certainly not Emma Goldman at her best.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.280]   Emma Goldman at her best was about the ultimate freedom
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:54.520]   of the individual, of caring about people
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:58.240]   who are desperately poor, who despised the corporate idea
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:00.880]   that we all have to be made cookie cutters
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:02.080]   and be interchangeable
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:04.000]   and all have to start work at the same time.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.760]   And basically our entire lives slave for corporation
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.040]   that have nothing to show for it
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.400]   while they get wealthy and you have no opportunity
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:13.320]   for either productive work or creative work.
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:17.680]   So that I think the valorization of kind of the lowest
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:20.240]   of the low is something I find very admirable.
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:23.200]   There's a quote of hers, which I think even for those of us
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:25.600]   who are, you know, for property rights,
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:27.800]   is left anarchism at its best,
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:30.680]   but she goes, "Go and ask for work.
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:33.320]   If they don't give you work, ask for bread.
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:35.200]   If they don't give you bread, take bread."
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:37.000]   So the idea that like, if you're that poor
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.920]   and you're honestly trying to work and work isn't available
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:42.160]   and you steal food to keep alive,
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.120]   that you shouldn't feel guilt about it.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.120]   I don't know that I would disagree with that.
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.880]   I think that there's something to be said at that point
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.520]   where it's just like, you know,
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:53.360]   if property rights come between that and mass starvation,
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:54.960]   it's gonna be very hard for anyone
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.400]   to make the case for property rights.
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:58.960]   Now, my argument is when you have free enterprise,
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:01.800]   food becomes so plentiful that now obesity is an issue.
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:03.520]   But at the time she did not have, of course,
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:06.320]   have that data to, you know, access.
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:09.400]   - Is there somebody you left out from the book
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:11.640]   that you thought about leaving in?
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:14.640]   Like some interesting figures.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:15.840]   - Yeah, there's a couple.
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:19.320]   So Chomsky would have been one, of course,
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:21.920]   'cause he's probably the biggest anarchist,
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.160]   he's one of the biggest anarchist thinkers
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:24.480]   in contemporary times.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:28.400]   I was on the fence about Herbert Spencer
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:29.960]   because he's not an anarchist.
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:32.040]   Chris Williamson's reading the chapter for the book.
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:33.680]   He coined the term "Survival of the Fittest"
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:36.320]   and the chapter is called "The Right to Ignore the State"
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:37.680]   from his book, "Social Statics."
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.000]   It was deleted from later editions,
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.760]   but Bill found it and reprinted it.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:46.800]   And Randolph Bourne, he was an early progressive.
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:49.240]   He was the only one or one of the very few
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:51.640]   fighting against entering the Great War.
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:54.480]   And he had an essay called "War is the Health of the State,"
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:57.040]   which is basically about how states love war
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:59.520]   because it gives them an excuse to increase their power.
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.120]   And it's very hard to argue against increasing state power
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:03.200]   in a time of war.
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.200]   But since he was not himself an anarchist
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.440]   and there was plenty anti-war in there already,
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:09.280]   I didn't include him, but those would be the ones.
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:11.600]   - Is there some people that you think
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:15.680]   the public would be surprised to learn
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:17.720]   that they are at least in part anarchist?
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:21.400]   Like I saw that Howard Zinn is supposed to be an anarchist.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.480]   I mean, is there, just like Tolstoy is an anarchist.
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:26.560]   Is there some people like that,
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.800]   that you think in our modern life
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:31.200]   that would be surprised to learn they're anarchist?
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:34.280]   - I can't think of any off the top of my head.
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:35.920]   I mean, you could say Carl Hess,
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:37.760]   who was like Barry Goldwater's speechwriter
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:40.600]   from the 1964 campaign, but he's hardly a household name.
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:44.360]   I mean, I think a lot of people
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:46.760]   would not ascribe to that term,
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:48.280]   but are certainly informed
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:51.440]   with this complete distrust of all authority.
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:52.840]   Murray Rothbard had an essay,
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:54.440]   if I didn't include anatomy of the state,
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:55.560]   I was gonna include this one.
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.040]   It's much, much shorter.
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:59.400]   And his question was, who are our allies
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:00.640]   and who are our enemies?
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:03.200]   And the point he made is there's lots of people
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:06.280]   who would call themselves anarchists who are of little use,
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:08.720]   whereas someone who is still like a minarchist
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:10.680]   or for government, but genuinely hates,
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:13.800]   the question Rothbard had is if there's a button
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.640]   and you could press it, you would end the state.
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:18.120]   Would you press it so fast, your finger would get a blister.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:22.000]   Those are allies, even if they're somewhat of a minarchist.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.000]   So I think that is kind of a better lens of looking at it.
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.440]   And I don't think anyone needs to really ascribe
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.000]   to anarchism as a whole ideology,
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.920]   insofar as you're seeing right now,
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.880]   many people in certain fringe elements are just essentially
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.280]   or are decreasingly fringe and increasing mainstream elements
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:44.780]   are realizing that this idea that whatever the state does
[02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:46.960]   is somehow morally binding or legitimate
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:49.980]   is something that at least bears strong questioning.
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:54.560]   - Sure, and I mean, I guess there's a lot of groups
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:56.800]   like the libertarians, for example.
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:57.640]   - Sure.
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:58.640]   - That have some element of that.
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:16:59.760]   - Oh, sure, for sure.
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:02.720]   - Of harsh questioning of the ways of government.
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:05.640]   - And also I think what I love, I mean,
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:07.960]   if there's one issue where I would want people
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:10.480]   to have this kind of analysis, it is war.
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:13.760]   And it is like, okay, are you really sure?
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:15.920]   'Cause this is 100% gonna result
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:17.680]   in a lot of people being killed,
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:19.600]   a lot of people being traumatized,
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:22.200]   a lot of people who are never gonna recover,
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.840]   children, innocent people,
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.700]   are you really sure this is the right thing to do?
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:28.920]   And I think a lot of times the answer is,
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:30.760]   well, it's the profitable thing to do.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:32.880]   And that is, I think, again,
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:35.760]   government at its absolute most venal and worst.
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:41.220]   - You, Michael Malice, in many ways are a New Yorker.
[02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:42.440]   - Oh, yes.
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:43.560]   I'll give you one example.
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:45.180]   I don't know where Austin is on the map.
[02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:46.520]   No idea, not even kidding.
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:47.640]   - But does it even matter?
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:48.480]   - It doesn't matter.
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:49.960]   (laughing)
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:52.920]   - But nevertheless, you've decided to move to Austin.
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:54.420]   - Yes.
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:56.280]   - Why do you think you're moving to Austin?
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.600]   Or why do you moving both to Austin and away from New York?
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:02.400]   - This was one of the,
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.400]   both, I hate it when people talk like this,
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:05.520]   but I'm gonna do it anyway.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:06.680]   This was one of the hardest
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:08.840]   and easiest decisions of my life.
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:12.200]   It was hard because I've lived in New York since I was two,
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:14.720]   other than college, it's the only home I've known.
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:16.160]   I know it intimately.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.540]   I know all the cool spots.
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:20.720]   I love it with every fiber of my being, or I did.
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:23.800]   It was very much ingrained in my personality,
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.520]   my outlook about what cities can be and can't be
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.080]   and should be and shouldn't be.
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:31.400]   Deciding to move was not done,
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:35.400]   but when you see your crew, your chosen family,
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:39.280]   one by one whittling away, it's not easy.
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:40.560]   They all left.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.960]   There's just a couple of us left in New York.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:45.680]   And I don't see any mechanism
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:47.240]   by which New York is gonna improve.
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:49.280]   Things are getting much worse all the time.
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:51.480]   It's just completely outrageous.
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:54.520]   Here, I would have a huge crew.
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:56.640]   I didn't realize how much cheaper real estate is
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:57.480]   than in New York.
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:58.520]   This is another way when you,
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:00.520]   so New Yorkers are the most provincial people on earth
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.560]   who are completely oblivious to the rest of the country.
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:03.400]   So for a long time,
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:05.060]   the argument was New York versus LA, right,
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:06.560]   for certain types of people.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:09.120]   And they would say LA is cheaper in terms of rent.
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.920]   So New York, let's suppose the rent is 1,000,
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:12.720]   LA was 700, but you'd have to get a car.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:14.400]   I'm like, this is kind of a wash.
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:18.340]   So I assumed Austin would be like 80% of New York prices.
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:19.640]   And I'm looking at these houses,
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:23.120]   and for like 700,000, you could get a house here
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.680]   that would cost like 3.5 million in New York.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.040]   So, and you could have a gun.
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:28.920]   And it's just like, I could have a yard
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:31.760]   and I could have a dog and I could have a three bedroom
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:35.480]   and I could have aquariums and my weird plants.
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.880]   So to have all that, and it's just to have,
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:44.680]   I am very, very lucky that I have such a supportive crew.
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.460]   And they're also very smart
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:48.360]   'cause they sat me down and they said,
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.440]   whatever excuse you have not to move here,
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:53.760]   we are going to make sure that doesn't count.
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:56.920]   So my buddy Matt said, 'cause I have a huge library,
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:59.260]   he goes, I will go to your house
[02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:02.700]   and I will pack every single book you own myself
[02:20:02.700 --> 02:20:04.920]   so you can get that as an excuse to get out of the way.
[02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:07.420]   I don't know how to drive and you do this, Ulku.
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:10.100]   She's like, we're gonna take driving lessons together.
[02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:12.200]   There goes that excuse.
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:13.700]   How do I find an apartment?
[02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:16.360]   They're like, we'll go with the realtor
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:18.160]   and we'll take pictures for you, we'll report back.
[02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:19.520]   You could trust our judgment.
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:20.880]   And I'm like, that's very, I would do that.
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:22.440]   That sounds like fun, shopping for houses,
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:23.680]   I'd have to buy them.
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.740]   Then Matt just yesterday had the idea,
[02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:30.440]   goes, come here, rent a furnished apartment for a few months
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.240]   so you don't have the pressure of buying.
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:34.460]   And it's gonna be an easy transition.
[02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.640]   The rent's not gonna be anything compared to New York.
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:39.320]   I'm like, these are all very valid things.
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:41.640]   You're here, lots of other people.
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:44.000]   - By the way, that's what this is.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.100]   I made sure that's renting month to month.
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:48.080]   - Oh, this is rental.
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:49.440]   - This is rental.
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:50.360]   You didn't realize this.
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.200]   - I thought you bought this.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:52.640]   - No, no, no, this is rental.
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:53.480]   - We didn't talk.
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:54.300]   - Why?
[02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:55.140]   - I thought you bought it.
[02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:55.960]   - No, it's rental.
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:58.000]   Well, I really value freedom.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.160]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:00.600]   Who are you talking to?
[02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:01.440]   (laughing)
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:02.560]   Have you heard of this thing, freedom?
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:03.560]   It's really great.
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:05.160]   (laughing)
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:07.960]   - But not everybody, the implementation of freedom
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:08.960]   is different for everybody.
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:09.800]   - Of course.
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:14.320]   - For me, I don't wanna make a statement about others.
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:15.680]   I'll just speak for myself.
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:17.720]   I think when you buy a house,
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:21.760]   that is not just a wise financial decision
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:24.320]   or all those kinds of reasons that people have,
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:26.360]   investment, all those kinds of things.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:29.540]   I think it's also a hit on your freedom
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:31.660]   because the positive way to frame that
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:33.040]   is you make it a home.
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:33.880]   - Yes.
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:35.120]   - So you have a deep connection to it.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:36.840]   But the negative way to frame it
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:39.380]   is you're now a little bit stuck there.
[02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:40.220]   - Yeah.
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:43.080]   - And you may stay there way longer than you should
[02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:46.480]   when much better opportunities for life come up.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:48.640]   There's stages in life when you're not sure
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:50.080]   exactly what the future will hold.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:52.120]   I would argue that's very often the case,
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:54.960]   basically at every stage in life.
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:58.080]   And I just wanna make sure I maximize the freedom
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:03.080]   to embrace the most ambitious, the craziest,
[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:07.280]   the wildest, the most beautiful opportunities that come by.
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:08.360]   You've actually brought this up too,
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:10.360]   'cause I said I really enjoyed the conversation
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:12.160]   with you and Yaron.
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:13.000]   - Yeah.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.840]   - And you talking to you and somebody else,
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:20.000]   I think you make a really significant effort.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.760]   You've said this before, but it really is true.
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:26.160]   And it stands in contrast to other folks
[02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:27.280]   who are also good conversation.
[02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:29.960]   You really make an effort for that person,
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:32.040]   like to meet the person.
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:33.240]   - Oh, for sure.
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:36.560]   - And that's, you made me realize it's kind of a,
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:41.680]   it's an art form, but it's also just,
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:47.120]   it's a thing worth doing of putting in that effort
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:50.400]   and that leap of humanity to reach,
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:54.440]   whether you're talking to Dave Rubin or Alex Jones
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:58.640]   or Joe or me, just those are different human beings.
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:00.120]   And they're taking that leap.
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:00.960]   It's fascinating.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:04.160]   I mean, do you have, how do you think about that?
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:07.140]   - I'm a huge introvert as you are, I think.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:13.960]   I feel very, very, very lucky that I get to get on a mic
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:17.520]   and run my mouth.
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:19.920]   And for some people, for some reason, people like this.
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:24.920]   So I know what it's like to have a good convo
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:27.880]   and I know what it's like to have a bad convo.
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:29.720]   So before I'll do a show,
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:33.640]   I will have like some things I would want to talk about.
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:35.000]   And then I'll think about how to say them
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.340]   in an engaging way.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:38.360]   So I do my homework in that regard.
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:42.120]   I'm also very good at, or I pride myself at,
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:45.200]   taking people who are cerebral or intellectual
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.280]   and making them a little bit silly,
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:49.680]   but also making them feel safe to be silly
[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:52.280]   'cause I'm not going to be making a buffoon of them
[02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:53.680]   that we're having fun
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:55.880]   as opposed to disrespecting the person.
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.720]   I think we all saw that with Yaron,
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:59.760]   who's very cerebral, very serious,
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:03.560]   but we were all cracking jokes and he was having a good time
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:06.640]   and he knew even if I'm making fun of him to his face,
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:08.560]   it is coming from a place of kindness
[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:10.960]   and he's in on the joke and we're all having fun.
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:15.960]   That is something I try to do as much as possible.
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:19.200]   I had an episode of my show a couple of weeks ago
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.560]   and someone who's been a friend of mine for a long time
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:23.880]   and someone I admire a lot, Elizabeth Spires,
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:26.480]   she was the founding member of Gawk,
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:27.840]   founding editor of Gawker.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:30.240]   You know, she's worked for the Observer for Jared Kushner.
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:32.560]   She's her resume second to none.
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:34.480]   And she was on my show and she was talking,
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.400]   you know, her politics are pretty straightforward,
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:39.880]   like corporate journalist, blue pilled politics.
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:41.400]   And my audience was very upset
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.400]   that I wasn't pushing back or like whatever.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:47.320]   I'm like, my job, if someone is coming to a place
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:49.880]   where like the audience is at least gonna be somewhat hostile
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:53.560]   is not to make her have negative consequences
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:56.040]   for doing something that she didn't need to do.
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:58.800]   My job is to make sure that the experience
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:02.040]   is a positive one for her as the host.
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:05.640]   So when I'm the guest, I always feel that my job
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:07.320]   is to make the host look good
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:09.480]   and make the host not feel like it's work.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:10.800]   And the audience really likes that
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:13.040]   because instead of it being an interview or intense,
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:14.360]   it is a conversation.
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:16.320]   None of us know what's gonna happen.
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.920]   And so this is something I think about a fair amount
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:22.760]   and I try to apply and insofar as it's successfully,
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:25.800]   I'm delighted and there's times when it's not successful
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:29.080]   and that's a shame, but all we could do is do our best.
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:30.680]   - Yeah, I really enjoyed that conversation with her.
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:34.320]   I was surprised by the dislikes and all that kind of stuff.
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:36.040]   - Well, one of the things I always talk about
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:38.880]   is I don't care what my friend's politics are.
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:41.360]   I care about if I'm having a bad day,
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.840]   can I call them up and ask for advice?
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:45.200]   And Elizabeth has been there for me in the past.
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:47.560]   And then when I do it on a camera in front of mics,
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:48.400]   people are freaking out.
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:50.600]   I'm like, I'm practicing what I preach.
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.600]   The relationships are more important
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.520]   than someone's political views.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:59.560]   And it's not hypocrisy at all to demonstrate that
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.200]   and not to push back.
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:02.520]   - And there was great humor there.
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:05.520]   You're both a bit of trolls in very different ways,
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:08.000]   but nevertheless, that connection, the humor
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.920]   and the mutual respect and love that was all there.
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:13.220]   Yeah, she was fascinating.
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:16.520]   You've talked to Alex Jones a couple of days ago.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:17.360]   - Sure, yeah.
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:18.360]   - You've talked to him many times before,
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:20.160]   but you've had him on your podcast.
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:22.040]   - This week, yeah.
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:23.280]   - This week.
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:27.880]   I was kind of surprised that he mentioned
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:32.880]   that human-animal hybrids was the main conspiracy
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.720]   that people should look into to open their eyes
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:41.720]   to the globalists, to all the conspiracies that are out there.
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:43.840]   Was that surprising to you?
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:48.960]   - No, because I came in there with questions
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.240]   and I was very focused on corralling him
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:54.440]   and having it be a coherent intellectual conversation.
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:56.680]   - That was a really, really good, it was only an hour,
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:58.080]   but it was a very good conversation.
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:26:58.920]   - Yeah, thank you.
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:01.880]   The response was overwhelmingly positive.
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:04.400]   And I'm like, all right, I'm in a unique position
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.880]   'cause Alex, I met Alex, well, that's not true,
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:10.200]   but I was on Alex, with Alex on Tim Pool a couple of times.
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:12.560]   It was mayhem, it was anarchy.
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:14.040]   And I'm like, all right, let me get,
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:15.400]   but the thing is what people enjoyed
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:17.320]   is I was the one who was basically able
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:18.800]   to translate Alex's.
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:20.960]   He's obviously very performative.
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:22.820]   And a lot of times Alex will say things
[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:26.480]   that are not really particularly controversial,
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:28.240]   but he'll say them in such a way
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:30.120]   that it sounds crazier than it is.
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:32.280]   I think Joe's made this observation as well.
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:35.800]   So what I wanted to have him on my show is,
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:38.720]   all right, let's go through all these conspiracies
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:40.600]   which have validity, which don't.
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:41.760]   And I knew if I asked him,
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:43.360]   'cause he's got a lot of historical knowledge,
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:45.800]   even if you think of a lot of it's nonsensical,
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:48.080]   let's sort out the wheat from the chaff,
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:50.720]   'cause everyone has someone crazy in them.
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:52.120]   I have this expression,
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.320]   you take one red pill, not the whole bottle.
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:55.520]   You take the whole bottle of red pills,
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:57.720]   you assume literally everything in the media is a lie,
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:27:59.800]   that that's just not a coherent position to have.
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:01.160]   Is the weather a lie when they tell you
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:02.960]   that the temperature is gonna be wrong tomorrow?
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:05.320]   So that was fun to watch him go through that.
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:07.520]   And he felt bad because he felt,
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:09.280]   incorrectly in my opinion,
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.960]   that he was needlessly aggressive
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:12.400]   and disrespectful toward me on Tim.
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:13.660]   I didn't feel disrespected at all.
[02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:15.560]   It got heated, but I didn't take it personally.
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:17.240]   People have heated debates all the time.
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:19.480]   So I think he promised me he wouldn't interrupt
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:20.800]   and we'd be deferential,
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:23.960]   but that because he promised to be on his best behavior,
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:27.360]   that gave me an opportunity to address him seriously
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.060]   and not to bring the clown aspect out of him,
[02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:32.140]   which is easy to caricature him.
[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:34.600]   My friend, Ethan Supley, who I'm sure people know,
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:36.840]   played basically a character based on him in "The Hunt,"
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:40.240]   'cause Alex is kind of this cartoon archetype.
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:43.260]   So it was really fun to get another side of him.
[02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:47.260]   And also it was just fun being on his show,
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:48.340]   just him being bombastic
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:50.880]   and just trying to be the calm voice of reason.
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:53.320]   And for once, the trickster was Apollo.
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:56.920]   - Well, I like this thing he said before,
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:28:59.800]   and that's what makes me the most interested in Alex,
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:03.200]   is the Nietzsche quote about the, you know,
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.920]   gazing into the abyss.
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:06.120]   I think he said on your show
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:09.000]   that he has become the abyss or something like that.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.520]   I think that makes him fascinating
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:14.720]   that when you really take conspiracy theory seriously,
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:17.680]   the kind of effect it has on your mind,
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:18.880]   that to me is fascinating.
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.120]   - Well, can I say one thing?
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:22.000]   The term conspiracy theory.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.720]   If you ask any layman, it's like this,
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:26.480]   you say, "Do you like puppies?
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:27.320]   "I hate them.
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:28.260]   "Do you like baby dogs?
[02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:29.680]   "Oh, they're the best, right?"
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:31.820]   The human mind is capable of doing this.
[02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:33.240]   So if you ask people,
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:36.680]   do you think extremely powerful people
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:40.220]   often get together and manipulate data or rules
[02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:43.240]   in order to further their power and control and maintain it?
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:46.160]   I think 90 plus percent of people would be like, "Of course."
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:48.220]   Then you say, "Oh, so you believe in conspiracy theories?
[02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:49.640]   "Oh no, that's for crazy people."
[02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:51.440]   Those concepts are identical.
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:54.920]   Now that term is used for people who are like,
[02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:58.120]   "All right, there's conspiracies in government
[02:29:58.120 --> 02:29:59.900]   "to experiment on people like Tuskegee.
[02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:00.800]   "This is not in dispute.
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:04.160]   "The CIA has unsealed things, Operation Mockingbird,
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:05.400]   "so on and so forth."
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:07.360]   And at the same time, conspiracy theory applies
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.640]   to people who say 9/11 never happened
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:10.960]   and those were holograms.
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:13.080]   Now it's the same word for both,
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:16.140]   but these are not at all equal truth claims
[02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:18.320]   and they do not at all have equal evidence to them,
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:20.560]   but it's very useful for powerful people
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:22.520]   to have that term in the zeitgeist
[02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:24.400]   because then I don't have to explain or defend.
[02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:27.520]   It's like only lunatics are gonna look further on this.
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:29.240]   Do you really wanna be a lunatic kid?
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:31.320]   And that takes care of the issue.
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:33.680]   - Unfortunately, the same problem applies,
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:35.560]   well, language applies to a lot of other areas.
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:37.680]   - 100%, that's the nature of language, yeah.
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:39.960]   It's used not just to communicate, but to obfuscate.
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:41.260]   - Obviously, that could be fixed
[02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:44.120]   by coming up with different words
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:46.480]   to label conspiracy theories
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:48.840]   that are much more likely to be true.
[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:51.040]   - Yeah, like power lead analysis
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:53.520]   is basically a conspiracy theory.
[02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:54.720]   - Well, this is the black pill
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:57.540]   versus white pill question with the abyss.
[02:30:57.540 --> 02:31:01.240]   Do you think thinking about these things
[02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:04.200]   can destroy the mind,
[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:07.820]   can make you deeply cynical about the world?
[02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:11.240]   - Yeah, because if you are thinking
[02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:13.040]   that you are not aware of,
[02:31:13.040 --> 02:31:16.600]   or no one is aware of who's controlling things
[02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:19.020]   and the level of their control,
[02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:22.040]   it gives you the sense of powerlessness and hopelessness.
[02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:25.380]   And my counter is the people in charge,
[02:31:25.380 --> 02:31:27.000]   one of the reasons I'm an anarchist,
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.320]   are nowhere near as smart and crafty as you think they are.
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:32.240]   And certainly maybe the ones
[02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:33.480]   to complete in the shadow maybe are,
[02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:35.080]   but the ones who are in the public face
[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:37.960]   most certainly are not, as social media has demonstrated.
[02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:41.520]   When you look at how senators and Harvard professors tweet,
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:46.000]   these are not intellects that you're in awe of,
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:47.200]   to put it mildly.
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:50.000]   So I think that kind of takes the bloom off the rose
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:50.980]   to a great extent.
[02:31:50.980 --> 02:31:53.800]   - You mentioned that you've been doing
[02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:56.840]   a lot of amazing things, been truly joyful recently.
[02:31:56.840 --> 02:32:02.340]   I don't know if you have a bucket list.
[02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:05.440]   Is there items on the bucket list you haven't done yet?
[02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:08.700]   Are you pretty much satisfied and happy?
[02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:12.340]   And if you die today, if I murder you, you'd be happy?
[02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:13.340]   - I could die today.
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:16.240]   - Is there an item on the bucket list you want to get done?
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:21.500]   - I don't, yeah, deep sea submersible.
[02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:24.860]   That would be number one in a bucket list.
[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:25.700]   - Why?
[02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:28.460]   - Because that's where all the most interesting zoology is.
[02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:32.580]   And to be in a place where
[02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:34.620]   virtually no human being has been,
[02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:36.700]   and to see these God's mistakes
[02:32:36.700 --> 02:32:38.700]   in their natural environment.
[02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:40.580]   My friend coined that term, God's mistakes.
[02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:41.820]   If you look at deep sea creatures,
[02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:44.060]   you can imagine God making some animal,
[02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:45.300]   being like, "Oh God, this is hideous.
[02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:46.440]   "I'll just throw the bottom of the oceans.
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:48.140]   "No one's gonna see this."
[02:32:48.140 --> 02:32:51.060]   So that would be my number one bucket list thing.
[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:53.860]   I would say go to the White House as a guest
[02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:55.500]   would be a bucket list thing.
[02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:58.240]   Russia, go to Russia would be a bucket list thing.
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:01.380]   I wanna go, these are secondary,
[02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:04.020]   like go to Eritrea would be a bucket list thing.
[02:33:04.020 --> 02:33:06.420]   I've got a long list of books I need to write.
[02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:09.420]   That's, I don't know if that's really a bucket list per se.
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:13.620]   There's not that much.
[02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:16.260]   What I'm at a point in my life
[02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:18.460]   is once you cross off certain things,
[02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:21.740]   you basically instead of driving the car, start surfing.
[02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:22.820]   And just amazing thing.
[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:25.880]   I talked to you about this medical thing before we started.
[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:28.100]   At a certain point, and I'm sure this happens to you
[02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:30.320]   'cause your platform's a lot bigger than mine,
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:32.000]   all sorts of things start coming your way
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.180]   that you never would have thought of.
[02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:35.300]   And you're like, "This is pretty darn cool."
[02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:38.540]   So to be, and that's happening at an escalating rate.
[02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:40.140]   Like I'm at a point now
[02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:43.060]   where I get stopped every day by people.
[02:33:43.060 --> 02:33:46.580]   So that's gonna be a weird thing for me to get adjusted to.
[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:51.700]   Without exception, everyone who has ever stopped me
[02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:53.100]   on the street has been cool.
[02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:54.780]   And it's been a pleasant experience.
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:56.300]   There was one exception in an event
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:58.780]   where someone was genuinely on the spectrum
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:00.820]   and they didn't understand distance
[02:34:00.820 --> 02:34:02.380]   and you don't touch people.
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:04.100]   But that's as bad as it got.
[02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:06.920]   So that is something that's gonna be weird for me
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:10.340]   to have to deal with over the next couple of years.
[02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:11.700]   But it's the price you pay
[02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:14.660]   and it's hardly a small price when people come up to you
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:16.300]   and say, "You've made my life better."
[02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:18.140]   But it's just weird when you go in,
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:20.620]   like I was at the gym and then someone tweets,
[02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.500]   "Did I see you at the gym just now?"
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:25.460]   It's kind of weird, and I'm sure it's the same for you,
[02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:27.900]   when you're walking around and you don't think about it
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:28.980]   but people know who you are
[02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:30.780]   and you don't know who they are that you're being watched.
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:31.840]   Even though it's not malevolent,
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:34.820]   it's still just, you don't get prepared for that.
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:39.300]   - Michael, there will be two really big names
[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:43.340]   that wanted to do this podcast, will do this podcast,
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:46.020]   that I considered to do episode 200 with.
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:50.380]   But then I realized, why the hell talk to somebody famous
[02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:53.480]   when I could talk to somebody I love,
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:56.820]   that nobody knows or cares for.
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:57.820]   (laughing)
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:01.060]   - You just hit a random number generator.
[02:35:01.060 --> 02:35:03.300]   - Yeah, I listed all the Russians I know
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:05.260]   and who's the easiest to get.
[02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:08.620]   - Yeah, who's the most desperate for camera stuff?
[02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:09.900]   He's got a shitty book out,
[02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:12.580]   we could talk about that for five minutes.
[02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:14.580]   This garbage cut and paste that he did.
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:18.140]   - Yeah, and it turned out okay, I think.
[02:35:18.140 --> 02:35:20.860]   Slightly above average.
[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:23.900]   Michael, I love you, you're an incredible human being.
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:25.700]   It's an honor that you would talk to me
[02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:26.700]   and you'll be my friend.
[02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:27.980]   Thanks so much for doing this.
[02:35:27.980 --> 02:35:32.100]   - The respect that I got when you asked me
[02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:34.660]   to be the guest for the anniversary episode
[02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:36.940]   was similar to the respect when my two friends,
[02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:39.420]   Josh and Zoe, they were gonna get married at City Hall
[02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:40.740]   and they said, "We want someone to witness it,
[02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:41.740]   "we ask you."
[02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:44.420]   So it's one thing when people tell you
[02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:46.980]   they like you and respect you, which I had growing up.
[02:35:46.980 --> 02:35:48.460]   It's another thing when they show it.
[02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:50.660]   And this is something that I do not take lightly
[02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:52.020]   and I hope no one takes lightly.
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:55.100]   And if someone does right by you and shows you respect,
[02:35:55.100 --> 02:35:58.020]   going back to kind of taking out for dinner, thank them.
[02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:00.380]   Buy them a candy bar, buy them a soda,
[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:03.580]   do something to show that you don't take it for granted
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:06.600]   because I think what you and I both want to do
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:09.660]   is increase human kindness as much as possible.
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:12.820]   And I'm gonna look at the camera,
[02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:16.940]   be kind to yourself because a lot of you deserve it.
[02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:17.780]   Dasvidanya.
[02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:18.620]   - Dasvidanya.
[02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:21.420]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:22.580]   with Michael Malice.
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:25.620]   And thank you to Gala Games, Indeed,
[02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:27.660]   BetterHelp and Masterclass.
[02:36:27.660 --> 02:36:29.340]   Check them out in the description
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:31.420]   to support this podcast.
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:35.020]   And now let me leave you with some words from Jack Kerouac
[02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:38.060]   that perhaps begins to explain the nature of
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:41.420]   and the reasons for my friendship with Mr. Michael Malice.
[02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:44.940]   The only people for me are the mad ones.
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:47.740]   The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk,
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:51.680]   mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time.
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:54.660]   The ones who never yawn or say commonplace thing,
[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:59.180]   but burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles
[02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:01.940]   exploding like spiders across the stars.
[02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:05.100]   And in the middle, you see the blue center light pop
[02:37:05.100 --> 02:37:06.900]   and everybody goes, ah.
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:12.220]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:37:12.220 --> 02:37:14.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:17.380]   (upbeat music)
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:27.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
