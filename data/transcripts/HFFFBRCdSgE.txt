[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   >> All right.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Let's take a look here.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.760]   All right. Here is my subject matter today. Is this on?
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.960]   Okay. Real estate, it's really on now.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.320]   Can it be added to a Boglehead portfolio?
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.640]   Should it be added? How should it be added?
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.480]   Let's talk about it. Something we don't talk about a lot.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.600]   First, some disclosure. I am not a financial advisor.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.920]   I'm not an accountant. I'm not an attorney.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.320]   I'm not licensed to do anything in the great state of Maryland.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.200]   So this is all for your entertainment and information only.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.920]   I have conflicts of interest.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.160]   I own a for-profit company called the White Coat Investor.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880]   Some of our advertisers are real estate investing companies.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.600]   I'm not going to mention any of those today,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200]   but be aware I have that conflict of interest.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.400]   The only company I'm probably going to mention today is Vanguard,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.560]   which I have yet to get to advertise with me.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.200]   So I don't have a conflict there.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.720]   Okay. Here's what we're going to talk about.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.440]   We're going to talk about the case for real estate in general.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.960]   Then we're going to talk specifically about the case for private real estate,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.480]   following which I'm going to present
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.440]   the most important slide in this presentation.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.000]   I call the real estate continuum.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.920]   All right. First, the case for real estate.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.360]   The first reason why someone might want to
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.040]   invest in real estate is because the returns are high.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640]   When you're building a portfolio,
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.520]   you want multiple high-returning asset classes.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760]   Maybe you want some lower-returning ones as well.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.560]   So what are we talking about? We're talking about stocks.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.480]   We're talking about real estate.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.760]   We're talking about small business.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.480]   Maybe some speculative asset classes out there might have higher returns.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.500]   But real estate returns in general are similar to stock returns,
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.880]   but are a little bit more easily leveraged.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   Once you leverage them, the returns tend to be higher.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   Second reason, low correlations.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.220]   When building a portfolio, again,
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.720]   you want lower correlations between your asset class.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.360]   If they're higher than about 0.8,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.120]   you're not doing a lot of good adding that asset class at all.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.760]   Correlations, of course, go from minus one up to one.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.880]   The lower, the better when it comes to building a portfolio.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.560]   For example, between US and international stocks,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.120]   it's anywhere from 0.5 to 0.94.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   With bonds, it's almost zero.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.440]   With commodities, it is zero.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.880]   Bonds to commodities actually have negative correlation.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.360]   In comparison, comparing US stocks to US publicly traded real estate investment trust,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.920]   the correlation is about 0.45.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.320]   If you compare that to private real estate,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.880]   it's as low as 0.17.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.320]   That's a good reason to invest in the asset class.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.980]   The third reason, real estate tends to be very inflation resistant.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.240]   These are real assets.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.600]   They tend to go up in value with inflation.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   The value of income, of course,
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.520]   income property is highly dependent on the rents that you are charging and collecting.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.360]   So as inflation rises and you can raise the rents,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.440]   then that provides some inflation protection,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.000]   at least in the long run.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.880]   It's also easier to pay back fixed rate debt with inflated dollars.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.880]   If you have a bunch of low interest rate fixed rate debt,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.400]   like a lot of people do right now,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.840]   and inflation goes up,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.760]   that can be a really great place to be sitting in.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.280]   Real estate also has relatively high cash flow.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.800]   A higher percentage of your return tends to come from income than from capital gains.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.360]   That's not always a good thing,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.920]   especially if you don't need the income.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.760]   But it can be useful for decumulation years,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.280]   and also for replacing earned income during the working years.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.920]   Another great thing about real estate is that it's a little bit easier to add value.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.640]   You're extremely unlikely to add value to your portfolio by studying and picking stocks.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.840]   If you have not learned that yet,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.760]   you will learn it this weekend.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.720]   But all real estate is local.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.320]   An active management has the potential to work better with real estate than it does with stocks.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.040]   You can also boost returns,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.800]   aka earn money by doing the work yourself when something needs to be done.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.120]   That introduces some aspects of a second job,
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.200]   which a lot of people find not very attractive about real estate investing.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   But it is an opportunity to add some value.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.520]   Another awesome thing about real estate are some tax advantages,
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.360]   which frankly are unfair.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.000]   They're unfair tax advantages.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.720]   For example, if you sell your home,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.640]   and it's appreciated less than $250,000 since you've been in it,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.920]   all that capital gain,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.680]   you don't have to pay capital gains taxes on.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.640]   If you're married, it doubles.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.160]   Depreciation. Basically, the government says your house is going to be worthless in 27.5 years.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.880]   The truth is your house isn't going to be worthless in 27.5 years.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.520]   It's overly generous.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.880]   Even for businesses, it's like 39 years.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.120]   Still overly generous.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.720]   That warehouse is not going to wear out completely in 39 years.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.280]   Then when that depreciation is recaptured at a sale,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.240]   it's only recaptured at 25 percent.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.280]   For those of us in the highest tax brackets, that's a great deal.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.600]   Take the break at 37 percent, pay it back at 25 percent.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.800]   If you get real estate professional status,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.000]   which admittedly is not all that easy to get,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.680]   or you take advantage if you're doing short-term rentals,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.480]   the short-term rental loophole,
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.320]   you can use passive losses to offset your earned income.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.840]   I know doctors, high-powered surgeons,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.400]   whose spouse qualifies as a real estate professional,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.320]   who pay no taxes on their clinical income because of depreciation from rental properties.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.480]   Mutual funds, unfortunately, can't pass through their capital losses,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.160]   but a partnership investing in a real estate property can do so.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.640]   Those depreciation losses, they're really only losses on paper,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.320]   but they can pass them through to you.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.760]   Opportunity zone funds are another excellent way that real estate offers some tax advantages.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.920]   Basically, allows you to pay less on capital gains that you get from that real estate.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.480]   But the very most tax-efficient way to invest in real estate,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.000]   is to invest directly in properties that you buy,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.480]   depreciate, and exchange rather than sell into another property,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.720]   a bigger property usually,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.320]   and then depreciate some more,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.280]   exchange it into a bigger property,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.240]   and finally you die without ever selling anything.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.440]   Well, if you never sell anything,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.040]   you never pay capital gains taxes.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.280]   Your heirs get to step up and basis a debt.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.240]   It's incredibly tax-efficient.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.600]   All that depreciation sheltered income,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.880]   and then nobody ever pays the capital gains taxes.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.920]   So that's one of the cases for real estate,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.160]   these unfair tax advantages.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.040]   Okay. So we're talking about the case for overweighting real estate,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.480]   because most of you own real estate investment property whether you like it or not.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.040]   The total stock market index at Vanguard owns three to four percent real estate.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.840]   Three to four percent of it is composed of
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.920]   these publicly traded real estate investment trusts.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   However, 90 percent of real estate by dollar value is not publicly traded.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.720]   It's not on the stock markets.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.840]   It turns out investors only purchase about 22 percent of single family homes,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   and only three percent of those are purchased by large institutions.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.160]   They're not on the markets.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.640]   It's a completely separate economy from what we're investing in,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.520]   in Vanguard index funds.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.240]   If you compare that to non-real estate businesses,
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.200]   you'll see that there's a few thousand publicly traded businesses in the country,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.760]   but there's 27 million total businesses.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.880]   However, the truth is almost all of those are one-person businesses.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.920]   Twenty-one million of those only have one employee.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.600]   Eighty percent of profits,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.680]   when you look at non-real estate businesses,
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.000]   80 percent of profits in the country are coming
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.840]   from those publicly traded businesses from stocks.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.720]   That's not the case in real estate.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.440]   So the idea is that if you overweight real estate in your portfolio,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.760]   more than a total stock market index does,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.080]   that's a little more representative of the real economy and real wealth in the country.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.120]   Okay. So enough about real estate in general.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.800]   Let's talk now about private real estate.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.160]   Okay. What is the case for private real estate as compared to
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.920]   just investing in real estate investment trusts that are publicly traded on the stock market?
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.800]   Well, you still get high returns.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.880]   They might not be higher returns,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.680]   as we'll discuss momentarily.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.600]   You get lower correlation and perhaps better risk-adjusted returns.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.240]   You may collect an illiquidity premium.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.960]   You certainly should by theory,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.760]   whether you do or not is a different question.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.520]   You may get lower expenses.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.200]   A lot of these, there's a lot of
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.640]   regulation when you are publicly traded on the stock market.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.840]   It costs a lot to comply with all those regulations.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.320]   However, when you're involved in these smaller properties, syndications, etc.,
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.120]   you can have those regulated according to regulation D,
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.760]   which is a much lower barrier.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.680]   It has its upsides and downsides.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   There's fewer regulators looking at it,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.760]   but it costs less to comply with it.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.520]   So you may have lower expenses in that regard.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.160]   You're also often investing in smaller properties.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.000]   A duplex just isn't going to fit into a publicly traded REIT.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.960]   It's too big. It needs to invest too much money.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.120]   It's not going to buy the duplex down the street from you.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.640]   That might not be the case with private real estate.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.720]   It tends to be a less analyzed market,
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.880]   fewer people picking through it,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   fewer analysts looking at it.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.960]   Of course, in these sorts of partnerships or whether you own it directly,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.480]   the depreciation is passed through right to your tax return.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.720]   Okay, but here is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.240]   2022 is not a great year for most of us.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.960]   These are my actual portfolio returns from 2022.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.400]   If you look at my overall return is about minus 10 percent.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.520]   US stocks were down about 16 percent.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.200]   Small value did a little better.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.760]   International did about the same.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.840]   Small international did even worse.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.520]   Bonds did not have an awesome year in 2022 either.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.440]   I bonds were like one of those rare bright spots.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.440]   Well, if I look at my private real estate
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.160]   compared to my public real estate that year,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.080]   my public real estate got hammered right along with the stock market,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.920]   did even worse, minus 23 percent.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.240]   But my equity real estate did about nine percent.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.840]   On the debt side, I did a little bit better than that, nine and a half percent.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.200]   To me, that goes, "Hey, there's something here.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.760]   Maybe we ought to be looking at this a little bit more closely."
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.320]   Those are various hand-selected investments and how they did in that year.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.120]   Some of them did quite well.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.200]   But on average, about nine percent that year.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.600]   So, are private returns actually higher?
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.000]   This is a good question.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.680]   The answer is it depends.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.120]   I think the best answer is probably not on average.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.760]   But the risk-adjusted returns probably are a little bit better,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.240]   because they have lower correlation with stocks and bonds.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.480]   Once you incorporate it into a portfolio, it may do better.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.400]   But the returns don't actually have to be
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.920]   higher for it still to make sense to invest there.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:30.160]   So, here is a comparison in four sectors of the real estate investing space.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.320]   Retail, and US office,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.640]   and industrial, and apartments.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.640]   We're comparing private and public.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.760]   So, the red line is the REITs,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.640]   the publicly traded real estate.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.760]   The blue line is the private.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.240]   As you can see, it varies a little bit by sector,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.600]   but more or less, it's about the same.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.520]   However, when they look at these things more specifically in studies,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.560]   you'll see a lot of studies that come back with data like this.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.360]   You'll see here, the second thing down there are these publicly traded REITs,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.000]   and they did pretty darn well over this time period,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.760]   which is about 20-year time period.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.200]   It's up there 10.5, 11 percentage.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.600]   If you go down about halfway,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.080]   you'll see unlisted real estate.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.480]   This is the private real estate.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.800]   It did not do nearly as well.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.480]   It's about, what, eight percent.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.840]   So, it was higher in that study for the publicly traded real estate.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.240]   Numerous other studies have basically shown the same thing.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.400]   Time periods are all a little bit different,
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.800]   but it's basically the same thing.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.840]   You'll see that the public real estate did better than the private.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.640]   But then you start looking at studies where they look at
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.800]   incorporating into a portfolio to take
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.000]   advantage of the fact that the correlation is lower.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.040]   This study from Yutahi et al concluded that the optimal portfolios had
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.840]   higher weightings of direct real estate investments as opposed to REITs,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.720]   and that the optimal portfolios containing REITs are outperformed by
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.480]   those containing direct real estate investments.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.640]   So, it's not all about returns.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   If you look at the Sharpe ratio,
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.360]   private real estate, according to Black Creek anyway,
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.320]   has delivered better risk-adjusted returns for
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   investors over the last 20 years once you adjust it for risk.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.720]   By risk, they mean primarily volatility.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.960]   The reason why is the correlation is just much lower.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.640]   You see over the last 20 years compared to the 10 years before that,
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.680]   the correlation of the stock market with publicly traded REITs has gone way up.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.800]   It's gone up a little bit for the overall real estate market,
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.160]   but not nearly as much.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.200]   So, it's just much lower correlation.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.400]   This is interesting data too when you look at this.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.280]   You'll see there's a little bit of a lag.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.640]   Because the stock market is marked to market daily,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.840]   it goes down first.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.400]   Likewise, publicly traded REITs go down first,
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.200]   and then the private stuff follows it.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.320]   So, there's a little bit of a lag there.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.880]   If only private real estate didn't have
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.520]   such high transaction costs and such illiquidity,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.920]   you might even be able to take advantage of that.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.720]   This is interesting too.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.400]   Once the stock market gets pounded,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.080]   once publicly traded REITs go down more than
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.440]   20 percent compared to their net asset value,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.800]   then they do much better than private real estate over the next one to three years.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.160]   That's what this graph is showing.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.600]   So, something to keep in mind there.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.280]   All right. Enough about private real estate.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.840]   Let's talk about the most important slide in this presentation,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.000]   the real estate continuum.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.360]   This is what it looks like.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.800]   On the left side, you will see people who are basically real estate developers.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.760]   They go to the city, they get a permit,
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.560]   they break the ground, they dig the hole,
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.320]   they build the building.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.720]   It's ground up construction.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   Then you move along to the next category.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.640]   This is fix and flip.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.760]   You buy a place, it's like the shows on TV.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.320]   You fix it up, you renovate it, and then you sell it.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.040]   Coming next on the spectrum is short-term rentals.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.400]   You're running a hotel business here.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.680]   This is Airbnb, this is Vrbo.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.560]   People are renting your house for three days or seven days, something like that.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.520]   Next to that comes long-term rentals.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.760]   You still own the whole thing,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.600]   but you're now renting by the month or by the year.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.960]   After that is a turnkey property.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.920]   Basically, you still own the whole property,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.240]   but you're not doing any of the work.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.240]   You've hired it all out.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.120]   Somebody else finds it, they put the tenant in it,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.840]   they manage it, they repair it,
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.360]   they sell it, they're doing everything.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.760]   All you do is own it. After that,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   we're getting into the more passive types of real estate investing.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.640]   The next couple are available only to accredited investors,
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.280]   meaning an income of at least 200,000 for each of the last two years,
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.000]   300,000 as a couple,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.680]   or a million dollars in investable assets.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   We're talking about syndicated properties.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.600]   So the idea here is,
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.000]   99 investors go in together and they buy a 200-door apartment complex,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.120]   because none of them can afford it on their own, number one.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.960]   Number two, you get some sharing of expenses a little bit,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.480]   and you get professional management.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.760]   None of those 99 investors are being called when the toilets clog.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.480]   It's a passive investment to them.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.080]   It's mailbox money that comes in every quarter.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   But you own the property directly and it's a partnership,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.560]   and so the depreciation is still passed to you.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.840]   A private fund, often now structured as a REIT,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.480]   even though it's still private,
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.240]   is just 15 or 20 of these.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.240]   You put 15 or 20 of these apartment buildings into one fund,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.880]   and that's what a private fund is.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.920]   Then of course, at the far end are
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.760]   the publicly traded REITs that show up in your total stock market index.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.160]   As you move from left to right along the spectrum,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.920]   you will see that you will require less experience,
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.480]   you will have less hassle,
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.560]   you will get more diversification,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.840]   and as a general rule,
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.480]   you'll get more liquidity.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.920]   However, you're giving up control,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.880]   you're giving up tax benefits,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.160]   you are paying more layers of fees,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.520]   and you probably, if all of this is done well,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.160]   have lower returns because of that.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.480]   So there's not actually a right or wrong way to invest in real estate,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.600]   but there is a right way and a wrong way for you to invest in real estate.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.640]   You've got to match yourself up on that continuum with what makes sense to you.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.360]   If your goal is you hate your job and you want out as soon as you can,
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.960]   and you'll do anything to do it,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.480]   the answer might be building an empire of short-term rentals.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.080]   On the other hand, if you're like,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.600]   "I'm a retiree and I want to play golf for 12 hours a day,
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   and I don't want to do any of this real estate stuff."
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.280]   The right answer for you might be,
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.080]   "I'll just take the real estate that's in the total stock market index,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.120]   or maybe I'll just add a little bit of the Vanguard REIT index fund."
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.600]   That sort of a thing. Everyone else has got to match
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.040]   themselves along that spectrum somewhere.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.280]   Real estate, of course, is not mandatory.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.840]   You already own it, whether you want to or not.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.800]   Okay. So what we've talked about.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.240]   Real estate, while optional,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.280]   is a great asset class and often the first alternative that gets added to a portfolio.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.360]   Private real estate may not have higher returns than public real estate,
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.520]   but it does have some other advantages.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.280]   There are lots of different ways to invest in real estate.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   You don't need and you certainly don't want to do all of them, I promise you.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.480]   Make an honest assessment of what you
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.800]   want from your real estate investment before making it.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.400]   But you can invest in real estate without getting toilet calls.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.360]   It is not always a second job.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.840]   If you look at that spectrum,
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.440]   all of our real estate investments,
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.560]   my wife and mine, are on the far right side of that spectrum.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.800]   Some of them are private and some of them are public,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.520]   but nobody calls us for toilets, I assure you.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.280]   That is not the only way to invest in real estate.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   Real estate investing should not be a get-rich-quick scheme,
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.640]   but it can be a get-rich-quicker scheme.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.360]   It's still going to take years,
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.060]   but using some hard work, some leverage,
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.920]   you actually can reach financial independence earlier,
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.080]   most likely doing that.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.560]   Of course, passive income is a great term.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.960]   It is often not nearly as passive as it looks.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.920]   All right. Thank you for your attention.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.440]   Let me.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.440]   [APPLAUSE]
