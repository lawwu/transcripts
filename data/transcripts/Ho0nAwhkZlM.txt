[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Today's question is a follow-up.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.120]   It comes from a listener named Michelle in Wisconsin.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.120]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.880]   Thank you for addressing a wide range of topics on this podcast," she writes.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   "Your recent episode, APJ 1605, was of particular interest to me.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.200]   How can I serve the dying?"
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.240]   That's back on March 26th.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.880]   "I am a hospital nurse and served as an oncology nurse for three years in which I
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.560]   cared for many people in their final days and hours.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   I no longer work in oncology but do occasionally see patients who are near the end of life.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.960]   In episode 1605, you assumed the dying were believers and talked about the fight of faith,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.320]   but in my experience, very few dying patients are clearly believers.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.920]   In that light, I battled intense anxiety knowing that I was likely the last Christian they
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.280]   would ever come into contact with on this side of eternity.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.760]   Hours or minutes from an eternal hell.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.300]   This raised all sorts of questions for me.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.140]   Do I share the gospel even if the patient is unconscious?
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.620]   Do I offend family members in their saddest moments?
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.560]   How do I care for a lost person on the brink of hell, especially when their abilities to
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.700]   understand the gospel and respond in faith may be limited, and when the timing will likely
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.880]   feel inappropriate to the family?
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.400]   What would you say in this situation?
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.200]   The answer to this question is going to depend in great measure on three things.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.720]   One, the confidence one has in the truth of the Bible's teaching about hell.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.280]   Two, the love that one feels for a dying person, that is, the longing one has for the eternal
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.600]   joy of the dying person.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:03.320]   And three, the courage one has to act for the good of the perishing against the wishes
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.560]   of those who do not believe the gospel.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.400]   Or to put it another way, people avoid sharing the gospel with dying people for one or more
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.880]   of three reasons.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.600]   One, they just don't believe in hell.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.040]   It's not real to them.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.920]   It's not fearful.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.120]   What's real is the person lying there on the bed and the possibility that the person might
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.340]   experience some distress if you speak about Christ and sin and judgment, and they feel
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.600]   that the avoidance of that distress is a loving act because that distress is more real to
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.240]   them and more harmful than the prospect of hell.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.360]   Or second, they avoid speaking because while they may believe in hell, they just don't
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:07.760]   feel any compelling affection for the dying person or any intense longing that the dying
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   person would be rescued or that he would have everlasting joy in the presence of Christ,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.720]   the desire just doesn't become operative.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.320]   Or third, they don't share the gospel because they believe that their superiors in the medical
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.840]   profession or the relatives of the dying person have the greatest authority in determining
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.940]   whether you share the gospel and that God's call on you to share the gospel takes second
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.560]   place to that human authority.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.200]   Now, there are situations where we are not obliged.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.000]   Jesus said, "Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.360]   lest they trample them underfoot and turn and attack you," Matthew 7:6.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.300]   I think Jesus gave an example of this in Matthew 21 when he asked the chief priests and elders
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.760]   whether the baptism of John was from heaven or from man, and they huddled up, you remember,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.600]   and said, "Well, if we say from man, the crowd might stone us, but if we say from God,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.800]   he'll say, 'Well, then why didn't you believe on him?'"
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.920]   So let's say we don't know.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.520]   And Jesus said, "Well, I'm not going to answer you either."
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   In other words, I don't deal with people who are so insidious in their manipulation
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   of truth.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.040]   In other words, there is a kind of attitude that is so deeply devious and hostile to the
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.800]   gospel that there are times you don't speak the gospel to certain people.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.640]   Another thing Jesus said was Matthew 10:14, "If anyone will not receive you or listen
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.600]   to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that town."
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.360]   In other words, a group of people can show themselves so resistant that you stop speaking
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.420]   to them and move on.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:22.040]   So there are situations in which you do not share the gospel, but I don't know of any
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.760]   situation or any teaching in the Bible which would say that the reason we don't share
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.160]   the gospel is because some human authority says not to.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.560]   Instead, what we see is that when authorities did tell Christians not to speak, what the
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.240]   Christians said was Acts 4:20, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:58.880]   to you rather than to God, you must judge, for we cannot but speak of what we have seen
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.120]   and heard."
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.600]   In other words, God's call to glorify Christ and to love people by speaking the only news
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.720]   in the world that can save them, that call takes precedence over the prohibitions of
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.320]   all human authority.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:24.720]   So there may be times when it is fitting not to share the gospel, but the reason will not
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.120]   be that human authority has forbidden it, and I think that applies to government authorities,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.840]   religious authorities, professional authorities, military authorities, hospital authorities,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.320]   and family authorities.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.760]   Now what about the person himself that you would like to speak the gospel to?
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:57.060]   In general, I think if a person is cogent, it is fitting to ask their permission to speak
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:04.040]   to them about something very precious to you and something important for them, namely Jesus
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.800]   Christ and God's offer of forgiveness of sins through him.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.640]   I think if a person says, sitting across from you at a restaurant or lying in a hospital
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.640]   bed, "I don't want to hear about that," then you are not obliged to force it onto
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   them.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.680]   Nobody is saved by coercion, and if a person turns away the gospel that you are freely
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.220]   and lovingly ready to offer, coercive efforts to make them hear probably contradict the
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.920]   very nature of the good news as freely believed.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:50.520]   Now does that mean that a person who is dying and incapable of speaking—for all you know,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.040]   they may not be perceiving what you're saying—should not hear the gospel from you?
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.440]   I don't think so.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.400]   If the man who had been beaten on the side of the road when the Good Samaritan came along
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:11.120]   was unconscious, I don't think the Good Samaritan was obliged to wait until he gained
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.840]   consciousness to ask permission to care for his wounds and take him for medical treatment.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:26.640]   So I think it would be a beautiful gift to quietly and calmly and lovingly speak words
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.920]   of hope into the ear of a person who is unable to respond.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:39.800]   I think this calls for a great deal of wisdom, gospel sensitivity, as to what you would say.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.640]   For example, I would say something like this, "Hello, John.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.600]   This is Mary.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.280]   I'm one of your nurses.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.640]   I want to do everything I can to make you comfortable and to meet your needs.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.200]   I don't even know if you can hear me or communicate with me.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.900]   I want you to know that you are loved.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.960]   I love you, and God loved you by sending his son, Jesus Christ, into the world to bear
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.980]   the sins of everyone who trusts him."
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.840]   Jesus is a great Savior even now.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.200]   He is a great friend.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.440]   He is very merciful, very patient, very gracious.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.140]   He has forgiven all my sins, and I am so thankful.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:33.760]   And he wants you to know that he is ready to forgive all your sins, no matter what they
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   were or how many they were.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.880]   All you have to do is cast yourself on the mercy of Christ.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.160]   Fall into the arms of Christ and trust him as a precious Savior.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.660]   So I'm going to pray for you, John.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.240]   Father in heaven, thank you for your love.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:03.640]   Thank you for the amazing grace that saves sinners like me and John when we simply trust
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.760]   in our precious Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.680]   I pray that you would make yourself real for John as he lies here.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.980]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:26.900]   And if you ask me what to do if a loved one says, "Don't talk to my father about Jesus,"
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:35.520]   I would say, "I don't believe that a human command takes precedence over the command
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.380]   of love."
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.660]   Very bold and also quite practical.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.660]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.080]   And Michelle, thank you for the outstanding follow-up question.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.780]   If you have a follow-up question to something you've heard on this podcast, ask Pastor
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.780]   John.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.040]   You can do that via email, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.480]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:02.440]   And you will know if we got it if you receive an auto-reply immediately in response.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.200]   If you want to search our growing archive of episodes, you can do that online at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:17.000]   Well, what does it mean to be loved infinitely?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   That's the answer we're after next time.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.800]   And to get the answer, we must first understand that God, for a time, passed over sin.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.360]   He simply passed over it.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.040]   He didn't bring final judgment on sinners in real time.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.240]   He would deal with sin finally, but only later in the cross.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.960]   And as we reckon with this truth, we will come face to face with what it means to be
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.280]   loved infinitely.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   That's up next time.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.160]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.480]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   [END]
