[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.980]   There are seasons when life wearies us, when it seems like we're too tired and busy for
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.720]   any kind of meaningful engagement with our Bibles, such is the current situation for
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.600]   Elena, who writes us today.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.920]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920]   I live alone.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.920]   I work long weeks.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.720]   I find it nearly impossible to keep up with my Bible reading.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.160]   Cooking, cleaning, exercising, running errands, getting food, shopping, on and on, and by
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.480]   the time I get home I'm exhausted.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.280]   I schedule times to read my Bible, to pray, and to be alone with God, but I feel as if
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.760]   I'm only giving God 15 minutes of my day, and I don't want that.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.580]   But I have to pay the bills to live.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.580]   I feel stuck.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.400]   When I'm reading my Bible, I'm half asleep.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.300]   The only time I get now is in the weekends, but that's not enough.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.700]   In what practical ways can I beat back the busyness of my life to ensure that I make
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.640]   time for Him?"
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.320]   I hear Elena putting her finger on three things that are frustrating her time with
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.120]   God in the Word.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.520]   One is that she feels stuck.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.680]   Second, she feels exhausted, like she's going to fall asleep when she's reading
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.760]   her Bible.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.940]   And third, she's incredibly busy with many, many pressures pushing the Bible out to the
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.540]   edge of her life.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.620]   Let me say a word about those.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.660]   Just a word about being stuck.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.340]   I watch people get stuck in the snow outside my house.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.520]   They live on a corner, so they have to stop and then pull out into the street.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.820]   Some people sit there in the same place for 10 minutes.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.100]   I'm looking out there, so okay, I'm just going to get out there and push them.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.140]   But they just spin, spin, and spin as though doing the same thing over and over and over
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.440]   again is going to get out of stuckness.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.060]   Snow is part of the problem, but just doing the same thing over and over again is also
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.060]   part of the problem.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.540]   So getting unstuck might require putting it in reverse, kind of counterintuitive back,
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.260]   forward, and rock that thing out of there.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.100]   Or shoveling, you get out, shovel the snow away from front of your drive wheels.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.860]   Or you might ring the doorbell of the Pipers and say, "You got any men here?"
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.860]   Which has happened.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.020]   My sons and I have pushed a lot of people out of the snow.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.700]   So the point is getting stuck requires some sometimes counterintuitive new efforts.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.540]   So what might that be in relation to busyness and exhaustion?
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.340]   Elena lists cooking, cleaning, exercising, running errands, getting food, shopping.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.420]   Now those sound to me like classic, good, valuable things that tend to fill up your
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.700]   life.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.260]   And Jesus was in the house of a couple of women who were different in their response
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.260]   to these things.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.620]   You remember what I'm talking about, Luke 10, 40.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.740]   Martha was distracted with much serving, and she went up to the Lord and said, "Lord,
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.780]   do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?"
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.100]   And Elena says she lives alone.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.340]   "Tell her then to help me."
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.940]   But the Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.260]   One thing is necessary.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.940]   Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken from her."
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.860]   Now I know Elena says, "Look, I got to pay my bills."
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.700]   That's what she says.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.300]   But I think if Jesus visited her home and watched her schedule, he would probably point
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.180]   to some things and say, "No, that doesn't have to consume quite that much time.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.060]   No, you don't have to devote that much time and energy to that.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.580]   One thing is needful.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.660]   More needful than your pattern of cooking, more needful than your pattern of cleaning,
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.420]   more needful than your pattern of exercising, more needful than your pattern of errand running
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.380]   and shopping, it's just plain more needful."
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:35.900]   And in Luke 8, 14, Jesus warns about the way the Word is choked by ordinary good busyness,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   right?
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.860]   He says, "And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear the Word, but as they
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:55.500]   go on their way, they're choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life."
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.020]   Cares of life, oh my, don't we all have them?
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.700]   And their fruit does not mature.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.100]   And then he reminds us, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.140]   out of the mouth of God."
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.980]   So my encouragement is for Elena to sit down and maybe make a list of the way she's spending
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.980]   her life.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.780]   She's already got it itemized in this question she sent to us, the details of her life that
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.540]   seem to be robbing her of what she really wants to do.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.820]   And she should ask about each one.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.980]   Is it the way I do it the best way, and is it more important than spending time with
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.700]   God in His Word?
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.260]   Is there a way to readjust the time spent on these things to make time for the Word?
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:50.940]   And very specifically, I would say, maybe set your alarm 45 minutes earlier in the morning
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:58.820]   and take your usual shower, get dressed, put the Word of God before any busyness at all.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.460]   Don't leave the Word to fill the cracks.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.980]   Force other things into the cracks.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.780]   They will get done.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.780]   You will pay your bills if you read your Bible, you will, I promise you.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:17.100]   Closely related to this is weariness, especially if you get up 45 minutes earlier, right?
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.420]   She's probably shaking her head right now, saying, "Are you kidding me?
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.580]   I'm already dead tired."
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.420]   Closely related is this issue of weariness, falling asleep when you read your Bible, and
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.300]   who hasn't done that?
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.700]   Three practical suggestions.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:38.380]   One, go to bed earlier than you usually do at night in order to feel more rested, especially
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.980]   for the Word.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.900]   You can force yourself to go shopping when you're tired.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.740]   You probably can't force yourself to stay awake when you're tired, but you can go shopping
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.460]   when you're tired.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.300]   Second, in the morning, if you have to, go ahead and make your coffee and let that caffeine
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.300]   do its magic.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.660]   I don't drink coffee, but I get what caffeine does.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.860]   I can drink Coke and tea.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.620]   Third, I have done this hundreds of times.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:19.100]   If your body insists on getting sleepy, take your Bible in your hand and get up out of
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:26.980]   your comfortable chair and walk around the room in circles reading your Bible.
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.940]   There's nothing sacred about sitting, and it's much harder to fall asleep while you're
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.940]   walking.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.500]   I did it just the other day.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.780]   But perhaps more important than these nitty-gritty practical suggestions is the foundational
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:48.020]   experience of the Word of God is more precious than anything.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.860]   Remind yourself of this by preaching Psalm 19.10 to yourself.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.260]   Preach it to yourself.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.860]   The ordinances of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:10.260]   More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.500]   drippings from the honeycomb.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:23.180]   So don't let gold and don't let food feel more valuable or more sweet than the Word
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.180]   of God.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.180]   They're not.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.180]   No, they are not.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.420]   Great thoughts here, Pastor John.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.420]   Thank you, Elena.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.220]   Thanks for the great question.
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.300]   And we have so many great questions from listeners like you, and because of it, we have more

[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:48.140]   Well, today we talked about Bible reading and the challenges of life, which leads to
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.340]   another question.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.660]   At what point does our Bible neglect become sinful neglect?
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.660]   Question arrived from Germany.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.660]   It's a good one.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.180]   So on the table Wednesday when we return, I'm Tony Reinhart, your host.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.680]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   [END]
