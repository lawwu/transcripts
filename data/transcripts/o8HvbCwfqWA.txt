[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.600]   So excited to introduce Paula Pant.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.480]   She has an amazing podcast called Afford Anything.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.280]   And she actually filmed and recorded
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.600]   several of the sessions of her podcast
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.000]   at this conference with some people who were
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500]   speakers at this conference.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.160]   Her podcast has had 30 million downloads, which is a lot.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.880]   If you look at the top-ranked investment podcasts,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.000]   because I do, because I have an investment podcast,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.080]   Paula is usually toward the top.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.440]   She is a leading light of the FIRE movement.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.740]   Many of you saw her in the session yesterday,
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.860]   the panel discussion.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.400]   She's a former newspaper reporter,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.560]   but she's also an alumnus of the Knight-Bagehot Fellowship
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.120]   in Business and Economic Journalism
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.560]   at Columbia University, a very, very prestigious fellowship.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.280]   And we are so excited to have her speak to us today.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280]   Paula has a presentation for you,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.360]   and then we're going to take some questions from all of you.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.000]   So if you have questions for Paula,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.240]   you can put them on the cards.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.840]   Paula, come on up.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.240]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.560]   Thank you.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.000]   I'd like to start by showing you a very short video.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.360]   This is only 17 seconds, so blink and you'll miss it.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.520]   But it's a 17-second video that illustrates
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.560]   what I love about coming to a Bogleheads conference, what
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.600]   I love about a weekend like this.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.520]   Let's take it away.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.000]   Ready to fight.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:58.840]   [GRUNTING]
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   And this is the only room where people understand that.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.080]   So what's wonderful about a conference like this
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.800]   is that we can spend the weekend debating
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.680]   Roth versus trad and talking about how to optimize,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.960]   if you should execute Roth conversions, and how and when.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.000]   And we can talk about optimization.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.040]   And we enjoy those conversations.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.320]   But the core idea that we have learned from Jack Bogle
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.200]   is that at the end of the day, particularly
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.240]   if you're in the accumulation stage,
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.360]   money is not that complicated.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.520]   To be directionally accurate, as Jack Bogle has taught us all,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   low-cost, buy-and-hold index funds,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.040]   ideally in a tax-advantaged account when appropriate.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.800]   Oh, thank you.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.920]   Hey, look at that.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   Ideally in a tax-advantaged account when appropriate.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.080]   Focus on making bigger contributions to the extent
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.360]   that you can.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.560]   And if you do that, you directionally
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.720]   are in the right place.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.840]   And then we can later talk about optimizing.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.880]   And we can talk about particularly
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.840]   when you get to decumulation and withdrawal.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.720]   But it's not rocket surgery.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.960]   And I chose that, by the way.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.040]   I chose this not rocket surgery specifically
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.160]   because I knew that this is an audience that
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.400]   has a lot of physicians and also at least one person, Bill
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.360]   Behnken, who is a former rocket scientist.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.440]   Two people, two people, former rocket scientists.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.120]   So many of you have done or either are in
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.080]   or have been in professions that are very complicated
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.880]   and that are very high stakes.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   And what we've learned from Jack Bogle
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.960]   is that the simplest course of action is often the best.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.120]   Don't try to beat the market.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.840]   Meet the market.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.560]   Be the market.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.960]   We also know that the answers are out there, particularly
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.440]   within this community.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.680]   The answers are often abundant if we take the time
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.160]   to look for them.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.560]   But it can be easy, particularly with a deluge of information.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.320]   It can be easy to just ignore all of the answers
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.240]   and to end up doing things in a way that's a little bit harder.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.840]   And so the question in my mind was, why?
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.240]   Why is it that often we contradict our own investment
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.280]   thesis?
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.520]   Oftentimes-- and I will raise my own hand.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.480]   I am guilty of this.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.200]   I sometimes make money moves that are against my own better
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.480]   judgment.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.960]   I know better, but I will sometimes
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.160]   take that ill-thought-out, risky, proverbial water cooler
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.720]   investment on a lark.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.400]   Or I will not make as many contributions
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.360]   as I know I should.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.680]   It's the financial equivalent of eating that second slice
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.080]   of chocolate cake, or the third slice, or the fourth slice.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.440]   You know better.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.480]   We absolutely know better, and yet we do it anyway.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.120]   So why?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.360]   And what it comes down to, the answer to that why,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.560]   is that we have been led to believe that money management
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.120]   is simply tactical.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.320]   It's all about numbers.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.240]   It's all about spreadsheets.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.040]   It's the hands.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.840]   That money management comes from our hands,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.760]   meaning tactics, logistics.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.680]   But in reality, it isn't tactical.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.760]   It's emotional.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.520]   It's psychological.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.040]   If you think head, heart, hands, it's
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   our cognitive biases in our head,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.000]   and it's our psychological realities in our heart
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.160]   that influence what we do with our hands.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.360]   And so the reason that we often make decisions
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.560]   that go against our own investment thesis,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.720]   that go against our better judgment,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.920]   is because we often get in our own way.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.760]   Our behaviors are suboptimal.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.160]   And largely, that's because we are either anxious,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.080]   we are avoidant, or we are obsessed.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.880]   And so what I want to talk about today are each of these three.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.560]   And by the way, I want to give credit.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.040]   These ideas very much draw from the research of Dr. Brad
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.680]   Klontz, who is a financial psychologist.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.080]   He actually formed four money mindsets,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.640]   but I condensed them into these three.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.520]   But anxious, obsessed, and avoidant.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.680]   And we see this not only in ourselves,
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.920]   but we see in the way that life imitates art,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.680]   and art imitates life.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.800]   We see depictions of this in traditional media.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.840]   I know social media gets a lot of--
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.520]   when we talk about money, social media
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.560]   gets a lot of finger pointing at it.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.880]   But there's a lot that we can see in traditional media
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.800]   as well that illustrates some dysfunctional relationships
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.280]   with money.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.400]   And since sometimes it's hard to read the label when
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.000]   you're inside the jar, it's easier to recognize behavior
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   when it's presented as an archetype
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.640]   or as a character type on others,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.920]   I'm going to walk through a few examples
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   that we see in popular media of dysfunctional relationships
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.320]   with money so that we can see the ways in which that
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.560]   mirrors in ourselves.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.000]   We'll start with-- oh, go back one.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.480]   We'll start with feeling anxious about money.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.160]   And the clear example of this is Ebenezer Scrooge,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.080]   the fictional character from A Christmas Carol.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.280]   Ebenezer Scrooge had a lot of money
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   but was so cheap that he would not even heat his own office.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.120]   And he made his employees shiver inside of their office.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.200]   And what I like about this example
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.400]   is that oftentimes there's this myth
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.920]   that to be quote unquote "good at money,"
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.720]   you simply don't spend.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.520]   That being good at money means being frugal.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.960]   But Ebenezer Scrooge is a great fictional example
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.160]   of how that idea, taken to its extreme, becomes dysfunctional.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   It becomes antisocial.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.600]   It becomes counterproductive.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.960]   This is a guy who neither he could not enjoy his money,
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.720]   nor could he use his money as an expression of his values.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.920]   He didn't even know what his values were.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.120]   That's the entire plot line of A Christmas Carol,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.440]   is revealing to him what matters
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.400]   and why values ought to be the North Star.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.640]   And then money can be the physical manifestation
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.600]   of his direction towards that North Star.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.640]   And you'll notice his catchphrase, "Fah Humbug."
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.720]   When did he say that?
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.640]   He said that any time that he was presented
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.320]   with the proposal to spend some money.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:23.160]   His answer, "Fah Humbug," was his way of deriding
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.000]   or dismissing the idea that he spend a little bit of money
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   to make the lives of the people around him better.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.040]   And so here's someone who is wealthy,
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.800]   but anxious about money, miserly.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.880]   Now, another example, and this is a different type
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.200]   of anxiety about money, Monica Geller from Friends.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.640]   So Monica, and the reason I wanted to highlight both of them
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.480]   is because these are very different types
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.360]   of financial anxiety, right?
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.200]   Scrooge was cheap.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.120]   Monica isn't cheap towards her friends.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.320]   You know, she's a good friend.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.720]   That's the name of the show, after all.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.280]   But Monica was just very anxious all the time.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.840]   She, I mean, didn't have a catchphrase per se,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.080]   but she would often, at multiple times during the show,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.560]   she would say, "Oh, do you know how much these things cost?"
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.480]   as her way of expressing a little bit of stress
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   around money.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.280]   And over the, I don't know how familiar you are with Friends,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.560]   over the span of the show,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.400]   she ended up in a fairly good financial situation.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.480]   In the beginning, she was kind of working lower-paying jobs,
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.800]   and she had a little bit of career insecurity,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.600]   but then towards the end, she had a great job,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.000]   she was happy in it, she was making good money,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.320]   but she was always anxious.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.760]   And that anxiety would come out in the way
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   that she fixated on costs.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.040]   It's a different form of money obsession,
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.680]   which we're gonna talk about next.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   It's this pervasive scarcity mindset
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.800]   that says, "I'm not sure that more money
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.640]   "is going to come my way, and therefore,
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.120]   "I feel the need to clutch onto every penny."
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.520]   Monica wasn't, she's not Scrooge.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.080]   She isn't cheap towards her friends, but she is anxious.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.480]   And so, to the extent that either of those characters
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.240]   can show a mirror, what are the ways
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   in which we feel anxiety, even when external circumstances
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.800]   do not warrant that worry?
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.760]   That's the question to reflect on.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.680]   What are the ways in which old scripts, old behaviors,
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.320]   memories of times in the past
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.040]   when we might not have had enough,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.040]   what are the ways in which that has stayed with us,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.800]   even though our actual financial reality today
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   is quite different, but the scars from back
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.160]   when we had less remain, and therefore,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.760]   those dysfunctional relationships with money also remain.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.800]   Those are the questions to ask yourself
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.720]   as we look at some of these characters.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.040]   All right, let's move to money obsession.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   This is my favorite.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.720]   Montgomery Burns from The Simpsons.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.000]   Now, his catchphrase, "Excellent."
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.960]   When does he say that?
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.520]   He says it when he is harming others
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.720]   in order to make more money.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.360]   That's when he says the word, "Excellent."
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.000]   There is an episode in which,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.120]   so Montgomery Burns, for those who aren't quite
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   as familiar with the topic, he is, in The Simpsons,
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   the owner of Springfield's nuclear power plant
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.560]   and the boss of Homer Simpson.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.240]   And there is an episode in which he literally
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.800]   blocks out the sun from Springfield
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.480]   in order to force the residents of Springfield
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.120]   to buy more energy from his power plant.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.560]   There is an episode where he dumps
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.120]   all of this nuclear waste into the river
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.680]   and then the river springs up
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.400]   a bunch of three-eyed fishes.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:42.440]   He famously has a bunch of hound dogs at his mansion
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.160]   and one of his other big catchphrases is,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.440]   "Release the hounds."
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.160]   And so anytime that anybody does something
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.880]   that displeases him, he just releases
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.640]   a pack of angry dogs at them.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.280]   So he is the proverbial obsessed with money,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.000]   obsessed with making more,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.600]   but also incredibly isolated and lonely.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.200]   He doesn't have any friends.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:13.040]   He has an employee who is very devoted,
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.760]   but no real friends whatsoever.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.640]   And so he stands as a, not just a character,
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.640]   but really a caricature, an extreme caricature
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.840]   of someone who has lost the plot,
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.320]   someone who forgot that money is a means to an end
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.360]   and has hyper-focused on simply the money itself
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.280]   and has forgotten the fact that money
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.400]   is supposed to be a tool that allows
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.920]   and facilitates for better relationships,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.960]   a better impact on your community,
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.680]   for all of the pro-social things that it can do.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.320]   Another person who's obsessed with money,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.440]   and this is a different type of character,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.480]   Tywin Lannister from Game of Thrones.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:14.320]   He is, for those of you who are not familiar with this show,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   he is, on the surface, appears to be a family man.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.160]   Because he really is devoted to the Lannister family
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.840]   and he wants the Lannister family to succeed.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   So, on the surface, almost looks as though
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.720]   he's doing the right things.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.360]   And again, one of his favorite phrases,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.760]   which he repeats often, is,
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.000]   "A Lannister always pays his debts."
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.640]   And on the surface, that sounds great.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.840]   You pay your debts, wonderful.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.160]   That's great, we should all pay our debts.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.040]   But under the hood, he is someone
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.520]   who actually is chasing status.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.960]   The reason that a Lannister always pays his debts
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.400]   is because that's how he maintains
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.880]   power and status and control.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.760]   The reason that he wants his family to succeed
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.560]   is because he wants the ego gratification
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.960]   of the Lannister name to continue on,
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.840]   but he doesn't actually care
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.640]   about the individual members of his family.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.280]   And without spoiling anything in the show,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:34.320]   his obsession with the Lannister name
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.280]   actually ends up driving a wedge
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.680]   between him and his children.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.280]   It actually ends up, ironically,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.040]   harming his relationships with the very legacy,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.320]   the very offspring that he purports to want to help.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.640]   And so here's another person who,
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.120]   on the surface, appears to care about his legacy,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.280]   but actually destroys the underlying relationships
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.280]   within his legacy in an effort to make his name prominent.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.320]   And these are two examples of money obsession.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.080]   And it's really, it's an obsession with status
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.560]   at the expense of relationships.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.040]   And then we move to avoidance.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.400]   And you might think, all right,
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.520]   well, we're at a conference about money,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.840]   so clearly we're not avoidant.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.960]   Clearly, that can't be an issue that plagues any of us.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.680]   But, and I'll speak for myself,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.560]   there are certainly elements of my financial life
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.240]   that I pay close attention to,
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.480]   and elements of my financial life
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.320]   that I don't really want to think about, right?
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.720]   In the broad scope of overall financial planning,
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.080]   there are parts that are more interesting than others.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.760]   And so it can be entirely possible
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   to be a good steward of your money in certain domains,
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.400]   but also avoidant about your money
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.760]   in other very specific domains.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:23.040]   So a couple of examples of people who are avoidant of money.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.080]   So this is Ron Weasley from Harry Potter.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.840]   And he is very dismissive
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.360]   of anything that seems to relate to money.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.680]   He calls it rubbish.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.160]   He seems a little bit intimidated by it.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:47.280]   And money avoidance largely stems from,
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.200]   again, a similar thing to money anxiety,
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.960]   there is this sense of scarcity.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.320]   There's this worry that money might go away.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.400]   And so we don't want to think about it
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.120]   because it triggers this fear.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.360]   Another avoidant person actually is Homer Simpson.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   And I chose this photo intentionally
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.440]   because Homer often has,
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.460]   how many of you are Simpsons fans here?
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.320]   Excellent.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   Homer often has these get-rich-quick schemes
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.040]   that he's chasing.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.240]   So he has had across the span of the show,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.160]   I think 400 different side hustles
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.920]   that he's chased.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.480]   He's always looking for a quick buck,
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.560]   as you can see in this photo.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.120]   But he actually doesn't do anything
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.800]   to try to learn about money, to grow his investments.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.680]   He is, even though he's constantly
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.040]   chasing get-rich-quick schemes, he's avoidant.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.520]   And that also stems from the scarcity mindset
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.960]   of I'm afraid that money might not be there.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.140]   I worry that I myself am not taking care of it well enough.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.680]   I kind of want somebody else to do it for me.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.560]   Let me chase these get-rich-quick schemes.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.080]   All of that can play into ways that we are avoidant.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.160]   Maybe not with our entire financial lives,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.140]   but maybe with specific elements of it.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.880]   So money anxiety, money obsession, and money avoidance.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.880]   Those are all ways in which we can
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.120]   sometimes get in our own way
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.500]   and sometimes do things that are counterproductive.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.760]   And so the major lesson that I want to impart
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.560]   is to take a look at some of these examples.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.340]   You know, and in the way that life imitates art
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.820]   and art imitates life,
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:51.260]   ask yourself what resonates.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.780]   You know, maybe not, obviously you're not a caricature,
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.220]   but what elements of those pieces
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.660]   resonate with specific areas of your life,
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.300]   even micro areas of your life?
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.260]   You know, how do you see these things showing up in you?
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.960]   And then, how can you overcome that
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   so that you can get out of your own way?
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.180]   Thank you.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.600]   - Thank you, Paula, that was fantastic.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.100]   So we've just gotten a few questions so far.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.760]   If you have questions for Paula,
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.960]   please do put them on a card
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.420]   and there'll be someone walking around collecting them.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.440]   Here's a great question.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.260]   The person is curious if you have resources for,
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.480]   or strategies for couples who are of two different types,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.800]   e.g. the avoidant, married, the obsessed person,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.880]   or the anxious is partnered,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.800]   or the parent of an avoidant.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.160]   So tactics for relationships
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.280]   where you have different personalities.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.680]   - Oh, that's an excellent, excellent question.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.380]   Now I can't say excellent anymore without excellent,
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.820]   excellent question.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:11.560]   So if one person is avoidant,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.120]   what I would do, I would start not with the money itself,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.620]   which is a tool, but rather with a vision
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.040]   that you want to co-create together.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.400]   So what is the ultimate end game, what is the goal?
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.320]   Maybe as a couple, the two of you really want
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.260]   to retire at a certain age, but why?
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.280]   Like retire and then do what?
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.440]   Maybe you want to travel more,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520]   maybe you want to spend more time with your grandkids.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.080]   Like be very, very clear on what that end goal is
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   because especially to somebody who's an avoidant,
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.440]   money might sound like a solution looking for a problem.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.040]   The point of paying attention to money
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.960]   is not necessarily immediately clear
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.720]   to somebody who's avoidant,
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   but the point of getting out of a job that you dislike
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.380]   and spending more time traveling
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.240]   and hanging out with your kids or grandkids,
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.960]   that's immediately clear.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.020]   So you start with that end goal
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.120]   and then work together on working backwards
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.920]   from that end goal to show how money is a resource
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.480]   that facilitates the end goal.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.000]   But you keep the end goal as the focus
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.920]   and money is sort of as a tool that facilitates that.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   - I have a question about the avoidant
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.280]   and whether people who are inert,
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.880]   who just don't do anything because they're busy,
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.220]   are they also avoidant or can you just be too busy
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.060]   to get into this stuff asking for a friend?
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.320]   (laughing)
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.160]   - Well, the great thing about low cost
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.640]   buy and hold index fund investing
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.320]   is it doesn't actually take that much time.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.160]   - True.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.000]   - And so again, it goes back to the 80/20 of it
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.200]   being directionally,
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.960]   particularly if you're in the accumulation phase,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.300]   being directionally on the right track
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.800]   is, if you follow the Bogleheads philosophy,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.060]   very relatively simple.
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:34.160]   Low fee, index funds, good asset allocation,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.520]   good asset location, rebalance periodically,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.360]   and you're done.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.680]   - Great.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.640]   Here's a good question.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.680]   If one of these characteristics helped you be successful,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.280]   but they no longer serve you,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.000]   what suggestions do you have to enact change
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.880]   to serve you better going forward?
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.200]   - Ooh, which character?
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.040]   Was it Tywin Lannister?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:04.720]   There's an expression,
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.400]   what got you here won't get you there.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.980]   So oftentimes there are strategies that we take on
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.600]   that are helpful in a given context,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.480]   but that become even counterproductive
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.640]   in a different context.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.720]   So let's look at money anxiety, for example.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.640]   Maybe being Monica Geller
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.320]   and being hyper fixating on every penny
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.640]   at a time when you just don't have that many pennies,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.480]   that can be very, very advantageous.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.560]   Being ultra, ultra, ultra frugal,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.980]   being that Monica Geller character
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.160]   can be very advantageous when you don't have a lot,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.620]   but as you get more and more money,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:56.080]   your time becomes more valuable,
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.480]   and then you end up underselling your time
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.440]   for what is not very,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.560]   relative to where you are now, not very much money.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.120]   And so what I would suggest doing
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.580]   is think of every resource at your disposal,
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.000]   not just your money, but your time,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.440]   your energy, your focus, your attention,
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.160]   all of which are related but different.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.360]   Think of each of those as limited resources,
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.360]   and you're trading each one limited resource for another.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.660]   And so your goal is to figure out
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.000]   what is the right trade-off of time with money.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.860]   - I think this is a related question, Paula.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.740]   You mentioned the sense of scarcity
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.300]   can linger long after one's circumstances have improved.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.220]   Do you have any guidance or steps one can use
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.960]   to get over the sense of scarcity and the attendant anxiety?
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.540]   - Yeah, that's a hard one.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.900]   I struggle with this one a lot.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:08.100]   Again, it comes back to really placing a high value,
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.300]   not just on your time,
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.960]   because it's easy to lie to yourself about your own time.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.960]   It's easy to be like, "I'm quitting sleep, I'm done,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.820]   "I'm giving it up."
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.560]   It's so easy to lie to yourself about your time.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.900]   I think it's harder to lie to yourself about your focus,
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.380]   your mental concentration,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.940]   'cause even if you push yourself to stay awake later
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.400]   or to wake up earlier,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.580]   at a certain point, you just can't focus anymore.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.180]   Everything kind of turns blurry,
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.660]   and then you end up, people blame social media,
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.540]   but before social media,
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.900]   people still built those paperclip chains.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.860]   People still built paperclip chains.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.580]   People still stared vacantly out the window
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.960]   or at the ceiling.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   That preexisted Instagram.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:06.140]   What I would do is really try to be a capital allocator
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.540]   of your concentration,
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.040]   because that focus and concentration
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.180]   is maybe the most limited thing that we have.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.780]   - And how do you capital allocate your concentration?
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.940]   Do you have any tips on that front?
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.940]   - It's a matter of, I write things out with paper and pen.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.180]   Here's everything that is in my brain dump,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.640]   here's everything that's in my brain,
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.620]   here's everything that could be going on,
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.380]   and then I just, with paper and pen, I start ranking.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.020]   The reason I do it with paper and pen
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.860]   is I know that if I open a screen,
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.220]   I'm immediately gonna be like, oh, look, cat videos.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.260]   (laughing)
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.540]   And so paper and pen eliminates that distraction.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.980]   - What is the name of the financial psychologist
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.820]   you mentioned?
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.320]   - Oh, Dr. Brad Klontz, K-L-O-N-T-Z.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.820]   - How do you view real estate investing
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.420]   as part of your financial life and profession?
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.740]   I know it's part of what you've done
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.860]   to become financially independent, so talk about that.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.380]   - Yeah, for me, it's one of many things
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.580]   that I have invested in, so I invest in index funds,
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.180]   I invest in real estate.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.020]   What's interesting to me is in terms of the attention
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.420]   that the real estate component of my portfolio gets,
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.460]   and I should say my portfolio is about 50% real estate,
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.460]   50% public market investments,
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.460]   and those market investments, personally,
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.340]   I hold all equities, I don't have bonds,
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.820]   but I have a barbell allocation, equities, and cash.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.060]   So my portfolio is 50% market investments,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.660]   50% real estate currently,
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.780]   and then there's a tiny sprinkling of individual stocks,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.180]   but that's, I don't know, a small percentage.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.580]   What's interesting to me about real estate
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.100]   is that it's tangible, it's visceral,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:20.500]   it's discreet, and it's a little bit different
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.060]   than the norm, and so that tends to get,
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.520]   I think, not an undue amount,
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.820]   it may have maybe an undue amount of attention,
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:33.620]   perhaps because of its tangibility,
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.300]   whereas fewer people ask me about my index funds
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.860]   because, like, big whoop, everybody's got index funds,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.380]   even though I actually have them
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.020]   in equal proportion in my portfolio.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.380]   So I view, personally, I view real estate
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.420]   as the fixed income portion of my portfolio,
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.420]   which is the reason that I don't have a bond allocation.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.880]   So in that regard, I guess I have maybe a bit
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.040]   of a overly conservative portfolio
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.100]   because if I'm viewing real estate as fixed income,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.240]   then that means, functionally, I'm 50% equities,
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   50% fixed income, which would be conservative at my age.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   - What should people know, I mean,
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.960]   what should they be cut out for
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.040]   in order to have real estate as a,
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.200]   like, tangible real estate as part of their portfolios?
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.000]   What characteristics should people have before they do that?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.500]   - So I think that, number one,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.620]   don't do it if your reason for doing it is FOMO.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.620]   Like, if your reason for doing it is,
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.940]   well, everyone on TikTok is doing it, that's a bad reason.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:43.000]   Do it if you have what I call minimum viable curiosity.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.180]   And so what I mean by that is,
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.420]   you know when you were a kid
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.260]   and you were in elementary school
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.540]   and there were all these subjects,
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.100]   there was reading, there was history,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.780]   there's chemistry, there's biology,
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.420]   there's, you know, math, yeah.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.660]   And there are certain subjects that you were,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.340]   maybe there was one or two subjects that you loved
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.680]   and one or two that you hated,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.860]   and then a few that you had, like,
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.580]   kind of a passing curiosity in,
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.420]   and there's a kernel of interest
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.820]   that could be developed there.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.940]   You want, for real estate, you want at least that, you know?
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.140]   If you have zero interest in it
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.660]   and you're doing it only because you feel a sense of FOMO,
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.460]   that's the wrong reason.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.140]   But if there is that minimum curiosity
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.820]   and you're like, hm, yeah, no, I'm curious to know,
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.400]   I'd like to learn more, this engages my interest
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.880]   just as much as that history class engaged my interest.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.760]   Okay, then pursue it, then follow that curiosity,
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.000]   because what I have discovered is that
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.040]   the more I learn about something,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.320]   the more I realize how little I know,
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.160]   which then fuels my curiosity and my desire to learn more,
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.240]   and then that becomes a self-perpetuating learning cycle.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.120]   - Why do you think real estate investing
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.720]   has gotten so popular?
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.880]   When I look, again, back to the top podcasts,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.800]   half of them are about investing in real estate.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.360]   What is it about this moment
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.820]   that has people so intrigued about that?
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:31.920]   - You know, I do think that the tangibility of it,
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:40.080]   it feels real.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.480]   I think that's part of the reason why,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.440]   in general, at any given time,
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.200]   that's an evergreen reason,
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.640]   but as an evergreen reason, I think at any given time,
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.160]   people are drawn to real estate
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.320]   because of the fact that you can see it,
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.640]   you can hear the floorboards creak,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.760]   you can smell the paint dry.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.360]   That feeling of realness,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.800]   the fact that it engages all five senses,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.420]   particularly in an increasingly digital world,
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.560]   it becomes emotionally evocative,
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.120]   and things that are emotionally evocative
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.200]   tend to be psychologically sticky.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.280]   I also think, particularly at this moment in history,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.240]   where we have just had such high inflation,
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.560]   periods of high inflation,
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.560]   we know that tangible assets, art, gold, real estate,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.160]   that's where people put their money
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.000]   in high inflationary periods,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.920]   and so it makes sense, particularly now,
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.720]   coming out of a very high inflationary period,
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.560]   and coming out of that huge real estate run-up in 2020, 2021,
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.240]   that people are chasing returns
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.080]   and chasing an inflation protection.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.840]   - This person says, "Great talk.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.160]   "This was so great.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.700]   "You talked about the three mindsets,
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.480]   "but all of them were negative.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.240]   "What is the right mindset?
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   "What are the healthy monthly habits
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.920]   "that we should all follow?"
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.860]   - I would say that the quote-unquote right mindset,
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.220]   the healthy mindset, is one in which
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.740]   your money is a reflection of your values,
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.200]   so you treat your money as a physical manifestation
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.020]   of your values and your priorities,
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:29.020]   and you have an awareness of how your cognitive biases
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:35.300]   and your psychological fears, insecurities,
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.100]   hang-ups are playing a role in your decision-making.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.600]   We can never get rid of that.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.380]   That's never gonna go away.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.260]   We're not like, you don't wake up one morning
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.260]   and you're like, "I'm healed now, all done, check."
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.300]   That is always there.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.380]   It's simply a matter of learning to recognize it
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:00.220]   and learning to not let it control you.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.820]   Fear never disappears.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.340]   You just get better at seeing it for what it is.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.780]   - So this question, I'm hoping the person who asked it
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.260]   can help clarify.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.600]   What do you make of Susie Orman's pronouncement
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.900]   that those with only two million for retirement
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.380]   will burn up alive?
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.660]   (panelists laughing)
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.140]   - Are you familiar with this, Paula?
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:24.980]   - Oh, yes.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.100]   (panelists laughing)
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:33.100]   Okay, this person is referring to a 2018 interview
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:38.740]   that I did on my podcast in which Susie Orman
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.700]   came on the "Afford Anything" podcast
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.900]   and my opening question was,
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.220]   "What do you think of the fire movement?"
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.660]   And her response was, "I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.700]   "And let me tell you why."
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.780]   And then she went on to explain that
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.540]   unless you had a minimum of five to $10 million,
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.820]   you could never retire.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:03.900]   But strangely, that applied only to early retirees
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.260]   and not to traditional age 65 plus retirees
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.420]   for reasons that she could not explain.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.580]   I tried to press her on.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.420]   I was like, "Wait a minute.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.360]   "So I can retire at 55 with 10 million
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.540]   "but at 65 with two million?
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.940]   "Can you math that out for me?"
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.300]   You know, and she couldn't.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.600]   So what do I think of that pronouncement?
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:37.700]   I mean, there were a few things going on there.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.420]   Number one, she was defining retirement
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:46.420]   as the complete permanent irrevocable cessation
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:52.400]   of all income, which is a very rigid definition
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.640]   of the word retirement, and it leaves no room
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.320]   for any type of part-time income, any type of flexibility.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.520]   It played to one thing that was going on a lot in 2018,
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.280]   which was this very semantic debate
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.920]   about the word retirement.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.360]   So I like to, particularly for early retirees,
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.280]   I like to kind of avoid the word retirement
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.160]   because then we get into, you know,
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.320]   the internet retirement police, you know,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.640]   who sit there and like they finger,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.300]   "Well, you did that consulting gig.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.720]   "Therefore, you're not retired."
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.440]   You know, like it gets into this semantic debate
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.000]   that then becomes a distraction from the overall point,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.240]   which is let's have enough money
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.840]   that you are more or less gonna be okay
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.540]   and that work pretty much becomes optional, you know?
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.920]   So I think that was one of the things that was going on
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.360]   and her dramatic pronouncement kind of highlighted
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.480]   the disconnect within that semantic debate.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.700]   As to the actual claim that you can't retire
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.000]   with less than 10 million, I mean,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.360]   the math is pretty clear that you can.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.160]   So, I mean, there's just no justification
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.680]   for the fact that you need 10 million to retire.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.160]   - Well, Paula, we have been so happy
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.440]   to have you here with us today.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.480]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.640]   (audience applauding)
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
