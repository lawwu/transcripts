[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.080]   - Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.600]   This episode was hosted by
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.320]   the Pre and Early Retirement Life States Chapter
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   and recorded July 29th, 2021.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.120]   It features Sean Mullaney, a CPA, financial planner,
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.560]   and president of Mullaney Financial and Tax Incorporated.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.620]   He also blogs at fitaxguy.com.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.240]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.020]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.600]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.020]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.680]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:44.680]   - Then I'm gonna speak about tax topics relevant
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.220]   for the most part to those ages 50 to 70,
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.040]   those thinking about retirement
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.080]   and those beginning retirement.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.600]   Now there's gonna be some nuggets in there for all ages,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.440]   right?
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.140]   Obviously all of us, even if we're under 50 years old
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.940]   are thinking about retirement.
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.160]   So we're hopefully gonna get to ages 50 to 70.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.560]   And there will be some things in there
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.540]   for those who are a little further along
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.000]   in their retirement journey.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.660]   Again, my name is Sean Mullaney.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.820]   Carol, Jim, thanks so much for the introduction.
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.940]   And I wanna, first of all,
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.820]   say it's an honor to be presenting tonight.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820]   Really glad to have this opportunity
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.060]   to be in front of the Bogleheads group.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.900]   Real honor to be here.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.400]   And thanks so much to Carol, Jim, Miriam,
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.360]   the entire team for putting this together.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.740]   I know there's a lot of work that goes on into it.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.440]   So thank you so very much for that.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.800]   Just a little bit about me and sort of my background there.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.480]   Just, you know, we always do disclaimers, right?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.560]   So this is for educational
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.420]   and hopefully entertainment purposes.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's not investment advice, tax advice,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.800]   legal advice for any one person,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.840]   but hopefully this gives you some knowledge.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.300]   This gives you some resources
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.860]   and some more information and some more power.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.900]   Let's see here.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.100]   So doing a tax presentation,
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.060]   every now and then it can be a little dry.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.020]   So I wanted to think about,
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.780]   well, what's sort of in the news in the tax world,
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.580]   especially as it applies to pre-retirees, early retirees.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.540]   And to my mind in this investing environment,
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.500]   it's capital gains, right?
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.940]   There are so many people out there right now
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.520]   with an old dog or cat in their investment portfolio.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.420]   It did well.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.680]   They essentially have the good problem, right?
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.240]   They have the problem of years ago,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.680]   I bought a stock or a mutual fund
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.840]   and that thing is shot through the roof.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.560]   Oh no, how do I access it, right?
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.840]   Because capital gains are subject
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.280]   to federal income tax rates of potentially 0%.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.120]   We'll talk about that, 15% or 20%.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.300]   And that's today's rates.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.480]   You never know what the future is gonna hold.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.960]   And then also for some of the higher income people,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.720]   you're gonna add on to that
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.360]   a 3.8% net investment income tax, right?
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   If your AGI is over 200,000 for single people,
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.720]   250,000 married filing joint,
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.480]   we've got this 3.8% net investment income tax to tackle.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.080]   And then there's just the whole issue of AGI, right?
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.520]   As I'm sure most of you are aware.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.260]   AGI is one of those things
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.740]   that really limits other benefits in the tax code.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.940]   So, maybe we're not even so much worried
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.500]   about this particular tax,
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.860]   but we're worried about spiking our AGI
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.940]   because of a potential capital gain.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.500]   But we wanna access that money.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.180]   And I just give you a very simple example.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.980]   1995, Candace purchased 200 shares of Acme Corp
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.840]   for $100 a share.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   That means her stock basis for tax purposes is $20,000.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.160]   Today, that stock has gone from $100 a share
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.120]   to $500 a share.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.520]   So, we're talking about $100,000 of total value.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.080]   And we're talking about an $80,000 capital gain,
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.720]   but Candace wants to access that.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.000]   That's her money.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.360]   How can she access that money in a tax efficient manner?
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.480]   And so, there are exit strategies out there.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.120]   I'm actually gonna just lead off
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.520]   before I get into the ones that I tend to favor.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.200]   I'm gonna mention two quickly that I tend not to favor.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.160]   And look, your mileage may vary, right?
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.080]   Just because it's not my favorite technique
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.160]   doesn't mean it couldn't work
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.520]   in your specific circumstances.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.960]   One of them is the like-kind exchange, right?
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.720]   1031 exchange, like-kind exchange.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.060]   However, it doesn't apply to Candace, right?
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.080]   Because it only applies today to rental real estate.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.000]   1031 exchanges can work out really well,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.660]   but a couple of drawbacks.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.440]   One is it's not really an exit, right?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.400]   All it is is a deferral, right?
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.760]   So, the idea behind a 1031 exchange
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.240]   is I have rental real estate property.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.840]   I exchange it for another piece of rental real estate.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360]   It could even be something called
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.720]   a Delaware Statutory Trust.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.860]   But all I've done is I've deferred the reckoning on that,
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.700]   right?
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.600]   So, now instead of rental property A,
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.120]   I either own rental property B or rental properties C and D,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.960]   right?
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.780]   It doesn't have to be one for one.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.320]   It could be two for one or one for two.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.980]   Or I own something called the Delaware Statutory Trust.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.240]   There are issues with 1031 exchanges.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.000]   And like I said, they only apply to rental real estate,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.840]   right?
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.360]   So, limited subsection there.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.280]   The other potential exit is something called
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.080]   a Qualified Opportunity Zone, right?
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.980]   So, Candace could sell this stock
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.060]   and then roll the gain into something called
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.460]   a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.940]   These are new to the tax law.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.220]   They came in in late 2017.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.860]   And to my mind, they're not optimal
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.560]   because they are an investment product
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.460]   that is very designed around tax rules, right?
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.580]   They have to invest in certain assets
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.900]   in these Qualified Opportunity Zones.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.800]   And it's a very tax-motivated investment.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.160]   And it has a bunch of tax rules, right?
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.720]   So, I don't wanna spend any time on those.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.400]   We could talk about those a little bit.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.180]   Frankly, it's not something I believe
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.920]   I've ever recommended to a client.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.680]   So, you sort of see where I am
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.720]   on these Qualified Opportunity Zones.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.440]   In the right set of circumstances, maybe it could work,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.880]   but certainly not my go-to solution.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.280]   But what are some things that I tend to favor?
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.800]   Well, the first one is something
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.280]   called tax gain harvesting.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   You'll see why I favor this in a second.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.520]   The idea here is that if Candace
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.520]   can keep her taxable income below $40,401 if she's single,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.920]   $80,801 if she's married, filing joint,
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.960]   she can dispose of some of this stock
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.280]   and be in that 0% federal capital gains tax rate, right?
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.200]   So, capital gains tax rates right now are progressive
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.320]   and below these levels of taxable income,
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.540]   it's actually a 0% rate.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.640]   There is a drawback on that.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.980]   One, she's gonna manage her taxable income,
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.180]   not gonna be available to everybody,
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.480]   but if she is otherwise low income,
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.960]   this could be a great way of slowly getting out
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.440]   of this stock in a tax-efficient manner.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.280]   She does need to remember, though,
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.080]   she's subject to state income tax on that sale.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.960]   Now, look, if she lives in Florida, Texas,
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.800]   believe there are nine states without a capital gains tax,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   not a problem at all, and in many states,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   it's gonna only be a little bit of leakage, right?
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.560]   Because state income taxes tend to be progressive.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.040]   So, tax gain harvesting,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.320]   if she's got the right level of income,
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.920]   could be a great answer,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.880]   maybe a little bit of state tax leakage,
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.720]   but no big deal there.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.920]   I like tax gain harvesting for two reasons, right?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   One would be, I'm sitting on some appreciated securities,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.760]   I wanna reset the basis on them, right?
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.240]   So, it could be a mutual fund I like, it has a gain,
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.160]   I just wanna reset that basis,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.320]   and if I can keep my income below these thresholds, fine,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.160]   I just reset my basis.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.020]   The other one is maybe more like Candace's situation.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.080]   She's been in ACME stock for 25 years,
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.280]   she doesn't like it from an investment perspective anymore,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.440]   so she wants a tax-free exit,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.280]   or at least a tax-efficient exit,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.360]   so she starts dripping it out
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.160]   in terms of some taxable sales,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.180]   does this tax gain harvesting, manages her income,
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.880]   and then she reallocates into her desired stocks,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.480]   bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, whatever it is she likes.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.920]   So, to my mind, there's the tax angle
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.240]   to tax gain harvesting, just resetting basis,
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.300]   or it's, hey, I want to reallocate
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.560]   or get into cash in a tax-efficient manner.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.360]   So, that's tax gain harvesting,
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.640]   a lot been written about that,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.560]   I myself have written about that,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.200]   but you need to keep that income low enough.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.440]   Another exit, and this exit is charitable gifting,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.440]   this is for the otherwise charitably inclined, right?
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.320]   Charitable contributions are great,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.440]   but they're a real expensive way to get a tax benefit
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.760]   if you aren't otherwise charitably inclined,
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.720]   and there are plenty of people,
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.360]   hey, you know, I go to mass every week,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.080]   I donate to my church,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.400]   or I have this charity I give to year in and year out,
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.720]   or maybe I'm just looking for a one-time donation,
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.960]   something really hit my heart,
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.360]   something really pulled at my heartstrings,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.940]   I want to give some money to them.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.220]   This Acme stock, in Candice's case,
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.600]   could be a real win from a tax perspective,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.800]   and so what am I talking about?
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.240]   There are plenty of 501(c)(3) charities today
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   that will accept, appreciate securities as a donation.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.600]   They have a brokerage account set up so they can accept them.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.000]   I believe most of the common,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.840]   most popular brokerage platforms facilitate this,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.600]   I myself have done this,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.140]   and what you do is you just go into that account
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.040]   and transfer a certain number of shares
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.200]   to the charitable organization,
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.960]   and so what you're doing is you're taking
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.160]   this appreciated stock and you're making it currency
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.880]   to do something you probably would have otherwise done,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.920]   which is make this charitable donation, right?
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   So instead of sending $500 to her church,
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.160]   she just goes into her brokerage account,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.800]   grabs one, says, all right, brokerage,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.560]   send one share of Acme, which is worth $500,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.240]   to that charity, right?
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.720]   So instead of having to go into her checking account,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.520]   she gets to make that same donation
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.600]   with the appreciated stock.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.680]   What does she do from a tax perspective by doing that?
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.960]   One, the capital gain on that share of stock, forgiven,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.240]   it's gone, it is never gonna be taxed,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.680]   and that benefit is not income limited.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   So Candace could be making a billion dollars a year,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.080]   maybe she's some big movie star or whatever,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.960]   venture capital, I don't know what,
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.360]   but the capital gain is forgiven
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.560]   regardless of her taxable income, right?
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.880]   No income limitation on that.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.560]   And then the second potential benefit,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.520]   which is income limited,
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.280]   is she could take an itemized deduction
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.880]   for that donation, right?
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.520]   So there is a limit,
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   you can only take a current year itemized deduction
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.800]   of up to 30% of your so-called adjusted gross income
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.000]   for donations of appreciated stock.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.880]   And it may be that Candace,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.520]   we're gonna talk about this in a second,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.720]   in a little more detail,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.280]   Candace may not be itemizing, right?
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.280]   That said, I think benefit number one is good enough, right?
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   Who cares?
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.600]   Maybe she's taking the standard deduction,
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.080]   maybe she's married, right?
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.240]   So if she's married filing joint,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.760]   her standard deduction is 25,100 this year,
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.560]   and it might be a little higher if she's over 65
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.680]   and blind and those sorts of things.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.760]   But so maybe this is a $20,000 donation,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.680]   maybe she doesn't have enough taxes,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.640]   mortgage interest, other donations,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.840]   so she doesn't itemize.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.320]   Well, okay, that's fine.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.000]   She avoided going into her checking account
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.440]   to make this substantial donation,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.040]   and she avoided a big capital gains tax.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.560]   So with or without benefit number two,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.400]   I think benefit number one is powerful enough
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.600]   that she might wanna do this charitable gifting.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.840]   And like I said, in today's environment,
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   I believe there are plenty of retirees
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.400]   that should just never donate cash to charities again.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   Maybe you do $10 at your grandchild's raffle or something,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.880]   but for the most part,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.080]   the serious charitable donations
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.320]   should be made with appreciated stock
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.600]   that you don't, for whatever reason,
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.120]   don't wanna have anymore.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.880]   One big caveat on this.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.640]   Stock bonds, mutual funds, ETFs,
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.480]   securities with built-in losses,
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.000]   never donate those, right?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.080]   What do you do, right?
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.920]   So, hey, I'm sitting on Acme stock,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.000]   it's got a $10,000 loss.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.440]   I want to donate some of that to charity.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.400]   Don't do it.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.760]   Sell the Acme stock first.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.640]   Pop that taxable loss.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.840]   It may be limited, right?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.000]   I'm sure everybody on this call
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.160]   is very familiar with the $3,000 per return limit
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   on taking capital losses against ordinary income, right?
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.600]   So maybe you create a big loss, it's deferred,
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.880]   but that loss goes on for perpetuity, right?
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.040]   So for the rest of your life.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.440]   So you create a capital loss,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.680]   maybe you can't use it this year
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.000]   'cause of other losses, fine.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.520]   You use it the next year or the following year,
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   but a loss is a terrible thing to waste.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.560]   So do not donate built-in loss stock
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.720]   or securities to a charity.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.960]   Sell them first, donate the cash.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.560]   Well, all right.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.840]   I don't wanna donate directly to my charity.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.360]   Are there other charitable things
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.920]   I could do with this appreciated stock?
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.320]   I call this planning technique,
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.560]   the hyper-donor advised fund,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.840]   because it essentially combines two planning techniques.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.480]   Something called the donor advised fund,
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.640]   which I bet a lot of you are familiar with,
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.440]   with that first idea of skirting the capital gain
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.600]   by donating appreciated stock.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.760]   So now what I do is instead of donating appreciated stock
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.480]   to a charity, I donate it directly
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.320]   to my donor advised fund, right?
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.800]   And what I'm doing there is I'm sort of stepping up
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   this game of charitable giving with a tax advantage, right?
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.480]   I'm avoiding the capital gain.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   So I transfer $1,000 worth of ACME stock
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.960]   to my donor advised fund.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.240]   First of all, subject to that 30% limitation,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.160]   I get that deduction potentially,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.840]   and I avoid the capital gain
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.280]   on whatever I put into the donor advised fund.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.800]   The donor advised fund will sell off that stock
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.920]   in all likelihood, and then you can redirect it
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.760]   to invest in, usually donor advised funds
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.440]   are a little more conservatively invested,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   but each brokerage will have a different investment menu
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.880]   for the donor advised fund.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.840]   The donor advised fund is a great timing play.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.320]   So what it does is it says, okay,
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.360]   I'm gonna transfer some assets
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.840]   to the so-called donor advised fund.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.840]   I'm going to take a tax deduction
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.080]   for the fair market value of what I put in.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   I avoid capital gain, and then I can donate
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.160]   to charities on my schedule, right?
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.920]   So maybe I have a big capital gain.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.680]   There's, let's just say I have a stock position.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.520]   It's worth, let's just say it's worth 20,000,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.240]   and I have a basis of 10,000.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.800]   I don't want to sell it and trip a $10,000 gain.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.840]   So I just put it in donor advised fund.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.720]   It's gone, right?
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.840]   I can never use it again, right?
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.320]   It can't fix my roof.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.040]   It can't install a pool, right?
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.120]   So I gotta be terribly inclined,
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.240]   but I might be saying, look,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.600]   I donate 5,000 a year to charity.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.840]   Well, why don't I do this?
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.880]   Why don't I do the donor advised fund
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.040]   for 20,000 in the year 2021,
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.080]   take that with other deductions
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.680]   as an itemized deduction this year.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.880]   So let's say my other itemized deductions are $20,000.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.520]   So now I take a $40,000 itemized deduction in 2021,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.200]   and then in 2022, 2023, 2024,
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   I get the standard deduction at 25,000 plus if I'm married.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.440]   And over the next four years,
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.280]   I donate 5,000 a year to the charity
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.960]   out of the donor advised fund.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.800]   The charity's experience with me is not different at all.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.240]   They just get 5,000 a year every year from me, right?
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.760]   'Cause people in real life,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.960]   people rarely say, you know,
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.040]   I like to donate 5,000 a year to this charity.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.720]   I'm just gonna front load, do 20,000 a year,
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.320]   and then not give them a penny
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.760]   for the next three or four years.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.320]   People don't wanna do that, right?
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.080]   So how do I optimize, right?
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.040]   In this environment where I've got
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.880]   such a high standard deduction,
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.480]   what I wanna do is I don't wanna be giving 5,000 a year
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.240]   and it just goes away and I get my standard deduction.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.080]   Why not take a bunch of money now,
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.120]   put it in the donor advised fund,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.320]   and then, you know, get a one-time tax benefit,
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.680]   and then rely back on those standard deductions
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.000]   every year after that.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.640]   That could be a great timing play
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.440]   and a great way to avoid capital gains.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.240]   All right.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.360]   Another one.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.240]   So I had an AICPA conference this week,
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.040]   and I will say in the advisor world,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.240]   and I'm sure in the client world,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.960]   people are starting to get a little freaked out
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.640]   about future tax increases.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.600]   I think it's very speculative,
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.480]   and I certainly don't think it's gonna be retroactive
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.080]   if it happens.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.840]   But there are people out there saying,
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.200]   look, you know, Sean had that slide,
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   15%, 20%, 3.8% surtax.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.400]   Maybe these are the golden days.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.520]   Maybe I should just sell now at 23.8% federal income tax
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.960]   rate and be happy I bailed out then
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.360]   before capital gains rates increase.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.240]   I think that's very speculative.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.200]   So it is not my go-to technique.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   Look, every taxpayer needs to make their own decisions,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   and I don't have a perfect crystal ball of the future.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.640]   So, you know, I'm not gonna speculate
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.000]   as to whether or not the tax plan is gonna pass or not,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.280]   but I certainly don't think it's a slam dunk, right?
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.320]   So this is definitely not my favorite way to go about it,
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.920]   but there are at least some people out there
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.960]   who are very worried about future capital gains tax rate
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.680]   increases and are looking to accelerate capital gains
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.080]   into the year 2021.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.480]   Like I said, because it's so speculative, I don't like it,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   but there's a second reason.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.160]   You know, like I said,
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.960]   there are other planning techniques available,
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.320]   but there's a second reason that I don't like,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   and it has to do with this.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.960]   That tax may never come due, right?
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.800]   Look, I get it.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.960]   Candice has an $80,000 built-in gain in her Acme stock.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.720]   If she doesn't mind Acme,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.080]   then maybe that tax never comes due.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.560]   If she's staying up at night
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.400]   because she's worried Acme is gonna drop 50%,
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.560]   then yeah, maybe she should just sell, get out,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.000]   pay some capital gains tax
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.800]   or do one of these other techniques.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   But if she's okay with Acme
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.400]   or whatever the built-in gain asset is as an asset,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.040]   maybe she doesn't care, right?
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.840]   So there is the ultimate planning technique.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.720]   And I'm sure most of you are familiar with this.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.440]   This is the step up of basis at death, right?
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.520]   So this is something in our tax law
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.760]   that I think administratively makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.360]   And what it says is,
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.200]   okay, at death, generally speaking,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.360]   your taxable assets get a basis reset,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.560]   generally speaking on the day of your death.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.080]   And so what happens here is,
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.320]   let's say Candice dies
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   and her heirs inherit the Acme stock,
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.200]   their basis when they go to sell it
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.080]   is the fair market value close of business,
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.400]   I believe on the date that Candice died.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   And so generally speaking,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.560]   if Candice's heirs inherit this Acme stock,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.880]   and let's just say it was worth 100,000 on the day she died,
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.960]   they get it, the estate closes out three months later,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.720]   it's now worth like $102,000,
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.040]   they only have $2,000 of capital gains.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.240]   So this is a reason not to sell these assets
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.680]   because essentially this is not a tax
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.040]   that we ultimately know is due.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.840]   It very well may be due,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.440]   but it will, generally speaking, go away,
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   it'll go away upon your death.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.360]   And so that is the ultimate tax planning technique is,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.480]   look, you've got this tax planning opportunity out there,
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.280]   you have to balance it
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.840]   with your other financial considerations,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.000]   but if you're only motivated by tax,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.960]   then maybe you just let it ride out
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.200]   and get that step-up basis.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.360]   A couple other comments on the step-up basis.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.240]   One is it's great with rental real estate,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.040]   'cause your heirs get to redepreciate,
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.280]   so it's a reason to hold rental real estate
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.600]   in a taxable fashion.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   Two, IRAs do not get the step-up and basis at death, right?
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:46.160]   So in some ways, if the option is live on your IRA
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.240]   versus live on your taxable assets
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.840]   and you're older in life,
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.480]   oftentimes, hey, if I'm really concerned about my heirs,
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.040]   I might wanna live off my IRA instead of my taxable assets
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.080]   because the IRAs get no step-up and basis at death,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.280]   but my taxable assets do.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.440]   And then three, apparently this is a little before my time,
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.760]   but in the year 1976,
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.280]   they actually got rid of the step-up and basis
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.640]   and they brought it back real quick.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.720]   So there was a year, apparently,
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.080]   and I gotta do a little more research on my tax history,
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.960]   but in 1976, the step-up and basis went away upon death.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.560]   Now, back then, the computing power was much less,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.280]   so it created nightmares because you would inherit stock
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.440]   or a house or whatever,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.880]   and you'd have to reconstruct asset basis.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.360]   Today, that's gonna be a lot easier,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.560]   but still, there's so many assets out there,
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560]   particularly real estate,
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.040]   where I still think that would be a real headache.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.160]   So we always have to think about,
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.360]   yeah, Washington's looking for some more money,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.320]   but I think this one's a very popular
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.480]   and administratively sensible tax rule,
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.800]   so I think it's gonna be around for a while,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.440]   but don't take my word for it.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.200]   You have to make your own decision on those sorts of things.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.640]   So yeah, capital gains.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.840]   There are ways, like I said, to get out,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.440]   but it's gonna be an issue for folks right now,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.160]   and then there's the ultimate out.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.400]   This next one, I think it's a great opportunity.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.800]   You do need to have a high-deductible health plan.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.000]   So this high-deductible health plan
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.760]   is a type of medical insurance.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.720]   You need to be covered by one of these things,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.840]   and it needs to be your only health insurance,
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.920]   generally speaking.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.360]   For the healthy high-deductible health plan,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   I think it's a really good coverage option.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.640]   Not everybody has it, right?
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.680]   So there are gonna be some in the audience
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.560]   where this is just not gonna be an option.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.960]   If you're on Medicare, no option, right?
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.720]   So you cannot have a high-deductible health plan
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.480]   once you turn 65.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.960]   The planning technique here is while you're still working
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.640]   and you're relatively healthy,
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.320]   have your high-deductible health plan
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.920]   be your medical insurance, and then max out your HSA,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.720]   and you're creating a tax-advantaged account
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.920]   that can really serve you later in life.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.440]   And that's, I actually, I've got a blog post,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.440]   I say this all the time.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.480]   You should generally be spending down your HSA
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.200]   in two situations, if you're in a dire medical situation
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.360]   or you are a elderly, dire or elderly, right?
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.840]   But we'll talk about, let's talk about building up our HSA
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.520]   and then spending it down, right?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.240]   How do we build it up, generally speaking,
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.520]   through our workplace, right?
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.720]   So we've got our medical insurance through our workplace.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.600]   They offer a high-deductible health plan.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.640]   We like that as insurance for us.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.120]   We should then maximize our HSA
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.400]   through payroll tax withholding, right?
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.360]   So the money that we take out of our paycheck
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.320]   to put into the HSA, not tax, it's excluded, right?
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.840]   That's fantastic.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.640]   Not only is it excluded from our taxable income,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.560]   it doesn't show up in our FICA income.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.040]   So we don't pay FICA tax on that at all, right?
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.640]   We don't pay Social Security.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.880]   We don't pay the Medicare tax on that.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.880]   That's only, if we're well above that 142,800 FICA cap
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.480]   on the Social Security cap, this is only a minor benefit,
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.640]   but you still get that Medicare benefit.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.800]   And if we're below the 142.8, we get a big benefit
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.920]   because we don't have to pay the 6.2 on Social Security
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.400]   on what we put in to our HSA.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.840]   That's really cool.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.360]   One caveat about that though,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.200]   it has to be through payroll withholding
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.280]   for this payroll tax benefit.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   You can just not do it through payroll withholding
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.040]   and write a check to your HSA.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.120]   You take a tax deduction on your tax return.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.680]   That's perfectly fine.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.280]   But if you can do it through your payroll withholding
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.360]   and get that FICA tax benefit, I say, why not?
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.440]   So it's tax excluded on the way in, right?
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.480]   So we get a tax benefit the year we put it in.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.040]   The tax, the investment income grows
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.120]   inside that HSA tax-free.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.400]   So HSA is a great place to have investment growth.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.480]   And then if we withdraw it
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.000]   for qualified medical expenses at any time,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.400]   it's tax-free there.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.280]   So it's tax-free on the way in,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.040]   it's tax-free while it's in there,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.080]   and then it's tax-free on the way out.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.800]   That's a really powerful tool.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.960]   One thing for my fellow Californians,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.240]   California does not recognize the HSA.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.720]   Same thing with New Jersey.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.840]   So in California and New Jersey,
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.240]   the HSA is a taxable account.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.800]   No deduction on the way in
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.160]   and the interest and dividends and capital gains
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.960]   that are generated on your HSA, taxable in California.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.800]   So it's a little bit of a drawback
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.040]   for California and New Jersey residents,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.640]   but again, you get this federal tax benefit,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.240]   which is so powerful.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.600]   So I still recommend them
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.320]   even for those in California and New Jersey.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.560]   In most cases, right?
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.280]   Again, when I say recommend,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.600]   I mean that in a general sense,
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.720]   not for anyone on this particular meeting.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.640]   Well, okay, great.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.720]   We work, we have our high deductible health plan,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   we have our HSA,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.640]   we're building up this money in this tax sheltered account.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.480]   When the heck do I withdraw it, right?
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.360]   You're saying it's tax sheltered.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.640]   I should keep it in there as long as possible.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.600]   When do I withdraw it?
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.320]   I would argue it's best to withdraw it at age 65 and later.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.360]   A few reasons.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.920]   One, we wanna keep it in there as long as possible
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.080]   to generate as much tax free wealth as possible.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.560]   But the second thing is the HSA has a time limit
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.400]   and it's basically the later of your death
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.000]   or your spouse's death.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.400]   So let's talk about that for a second.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.000]   An HSA can be left to a spouse, no problem,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.720]   just becomes their HSA.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.680]   But what if I leave my HSA to my parent,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.040]   my sibling, my friend, anybody, not my spouse,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.320]   they can inherit the HSA, they'll take the money,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   but the money becomes taxable income in the year of my death
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.280]   and it's also no longer an HSA.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.920]   So an HSA is a really bad asset to leave behind.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.080]   So essentially there's this sort of pressure
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.680]   and we're talking about tax free estate planning
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.200]   a little later, or tax efficient, I should say,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.520]   estate planning a little later,
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.880]   but there's a bit of a time clock there.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.200]   And so it's this delicate balance of, okay,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.080]   I'm 65 versus how long am I gonna live?
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.640]   Am I only gonna live to age 70,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.480]   in which case I probably should start spending it
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.880]   in my late 60s, or am I gonna live to 95?
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.080]   And why am I gonna start spending it down now, right?
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.520]   In my late 60s, if I'm gonna live to 95,
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.440]   I wanna have it enjoy tax free growth into my 80s
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.840]   and maybe even my 90s, and then I'll spend it down.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.320]   So there's a little bit of a tension there.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.440]   One thing you should do though,
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.200]   is before age 65, pay your medical expenses
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.800]   out of your checking account, right?
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.240]   And then track it, right?
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.760]   Just track all your medical expenses.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.600]   And then at age 65 and later,
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.640]   you reimburse yourself tax free
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.840]   for the weekend warrior injury you had at age 53.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.640]   You're playing Frisbee golf,
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.120]   sprained ankle, $300 medical bill.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.960]   Keep that, Google Sheet, whatever you gotta do
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.840]   to keep a record of all that.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.000]   And then bam, in your 60s, 70s, or 80s,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   reimburse yourself for that old medical expense.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.320]   Fantastic tax-free distribution out of your HSA.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.960]   That's some nice little tax planning.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.240]   And generally speaking, before age 65,
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.840]   if you're not in a dire situation,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.760]   just let the money grow in that HSA.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.800]   HSAs also can pay Medicare premiums.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   They generally, they can't pay Medigap premiums,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.080]   but they can be used to pay Medicare premiums tax free.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.640]   But then this becomes, well, wait a minute,
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   do I really wanna pay my first and second
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.920]   and third premiums out of my HSA?
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.840]   Maybe I wanna just keep records, right?
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   So I pay my Medicare premiums in my 65, 66, 67, 68,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.360]   just keep these records and then reimburse myself
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.440]   in my 70s or my 80s for my Medicare premiums
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.840]   from my late 60s and early 70s, right?
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.560]   This is a bit of an art and more than it is a science.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.040]   We don't, we neither know the time nor the place, right?
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.920]   So we gotta be a little artistic here.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.980]   And then I've mentioned some of these concepts here.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.520]   Definitely start at age 65
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   to let that tax-free growth accumulate.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.560]   And then when exactly after age 65
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.560]   is really gonna depend on your circumstances
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.520]   and just how long you think you're gonna be around.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.520]   And basically HSAs are great to leave to your spouse.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.960]   They're actually a good asset to leave to a charity
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.520]   because the charity ain't gonna pay
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.560]   a dime of income tax on it,
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.240]   but it's not a good asset to leave to anybody else
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   because anybody else, any other individual
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.920]   is gonna, your estate, a trust,
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.280]   they're gonna pay income tax like crazy on that thing.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.520]   So leave it, generally speaking, leave it to your spouse.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.240]   If you don't have a spouse, well, look,
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.880]   if you have someone in your life
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.000]   you just need to leave money to, fine.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.320]   But if there's a situation where there's some optionality
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.600]   and you're leaving it to an heir
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.480]   who perhaps doesn't need the money as much
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.400]   and you have a charitable intention,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.480]   the HSA is sort of where I look first
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.040]   for where to leave money.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.800]   Okay, Roth conversions.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.180]   This is a real hot topic.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.720]   And we're gonna talk about Roth conversions
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.480]   while we're working and then Roth conversions
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.960]   once we've retired, right?
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.440]   So while we're working, to my mind,
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.200]   there are two big planning techniques, right?
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.100]   While we're working, the first planning technique
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.140]   is the so-called backdoor Roth IRA.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.840]   This is the two-step transaction, right?
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.960]   So we do two independent steps.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.880]   The first step is a non-deductible contribution
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.440]   to a traditional IRA.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.680]   And then the second step,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.640]   I like to do this in the following month,
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.020]   the second step is we convert the money
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.600]   we contributed to that non-deductible traditional IRA
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   to a Roth IRA.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.520]   And we do this though, generally speaking,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.800]   only if we have no other traditional IRAs,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.240]   SEP IRAs and simple IRAs.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.880]   That's a big thing here, right?
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.600]   So I like to say the backdoor Roth IRA
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.320]   is a great planning technique,
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.920]   but it's profile dependent, right?
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.640]   For those of us who make too much
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.900]   to make a direct contribution to a Roth,
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.580]   we do this backdoor Roth IRA,
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.520]   but if and only if we have no other traditional IRAs,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.640]   SEP IRAs and simple IRAs.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.160]   And when do we determine whether we have that?
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.400]   It's by 1231 of the year of that second step,
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.260]   the Roth conversion step.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.160]   If we have other traditional IRAs,
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.000]   SEP IRAs or simple IRAs on that December 31st date,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.600]   most likely our backdoor Roth was not a smart transaction.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.280]   We're gonna pay some tax on it, not the end of the world.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   And the big thing I like to say is get clean by 1231.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.560]   So if we have other traditional IRAs
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.380]   and we wanna do a backdoor Roth,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.680]   move those out in a direct trustee to trustee transfer
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.760]   to our workplace retirement plans or 401Ks, 403Bs.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.280]   But we only do that if we like the investment options
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.480]   inside those plans.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.200]   If we do, great, it's a great way to get clean.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.880]   The other thing is the trap for the unwary.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.520]   I do my backdoor Roth in January, right?
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.880]   New Year's day, I make my 6,000 or 7,000 contribution
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.960]   into my non-deductible IRA.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.880]   A few weeks or at the end of the month
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.040]   or beginning of the next month, February,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.960]   I do my conversion step.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.080]   Great, backdoor Roth IRA, isn't this great?
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.160]   Oh, but wait a minute, in September, I left my job
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.720]   and in October, I rolled my old 401K to a traditional IRA.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   That creates a problem for your backdoor Roth
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.160]   because at 1231, you're gonna have another traditional IRA.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.520]   I've blogged about this.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:01.080]   So you can go to my fitaxguy.com blog.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.440]   I've written about it.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.840]   So that's the first Roth conversion idea for the working.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.440]   The second one is the so-called mega backdoor Roth.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.960]   This is using your workplace retirement plan
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.700]   to make after-tax 401K contributions.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.160]   And then shortly thereafter, could be automatic.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.440]   What you do is you convert the after-tax contribution
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.560]   into the Roth 401K, or you roll it to a Roth IRA.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.480]   Great little planning technique.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.240]   The thing about the backdoor Roth
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.560]   and the mega backdoor Roth,
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.200]   you need to think about it is that the choice is,
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.880]   I either invest that money in a taxable brokerage account
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.800]   or I invest it in a Roth account.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.720]   This is not a deduction versus Roth,
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.480]   traditional versus Roth question.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.860]   This is, am I gonna invest that money
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.560]   into a brokerage account that'll have a 1099,
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.940]   that'll have interest dividends
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.800]   and later capital gains taxes,
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.660]   or can I get that money in the Roth, right?
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.640]   So generally speaking, for those who make too much,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.480]   backdoor Roth IRA is a great thing.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.920]   The mega backdoor Roth has no AGI limits.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.640]   So you can be at the lower end of the income spectrum,
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.600]   you can be Patrick Mahomes,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.000]   you make whatever Patrick Mahomes makes, $40 million
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.240]   as the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.120]   If the Chiefs 401K has this option,
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.600]   he can do the mega backdoor.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.920]   Okay, well, all right.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.760]   That's like the mostly non-taxable Roth conversions
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.800]   while working.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.180]   If it works for you, great.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.920]   What about while I'm working, right?
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.840]   So I'm working and I have an old traditional IRA,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.040]   should I do Roth conversions?
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.840]   And I'd say in many cases for the "early retiree",
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.280]   I'd say no, right?
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.660]   The idea would be, look,
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.120]   if you're gonna be an early retiree
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.280]   and I have an old traditional IRA
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.760]   and I'm gonna have to be fully taxable
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.000]   on the Roth conversion while I'm working,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.360]   I probably should hold off.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.760]   Now, your mileage may vary,
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.480]   but I would generally hold off
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.280]   because there's gonna be this opportunity,
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.240]   hopefully in early retirement,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.900]   and I'll let you define that.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.280]   You're hopefully gonna have artificially low taxable income.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.340]   And so why not do those Roth conversions
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.400]   while you have artificially low taxable income
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.880]   as opposed to now?
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.600]   So that's Roth versus traditional while working.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.200]   Now, while we're retired, okay.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.960]   Now we're retired, hopefully early, but we'll see.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.120]   But if now, if we're retired,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.400]   the planning changes in terms of,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.520]   backdoor Roth isn't on the table anymore.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.360]   Mega backdoor Roth isn't on the table
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.700]   'cause we don't have earned income.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.080]   So don't worry about that.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.000]   Those are off.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.160]   But what we can do is we have old 401k, old IRA.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.200]   We can do Roth conversions that are fully taxable.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.600]   And we have two goals here, right?
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.720]   One of them is just the artificially low tax rates, right?
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.580]   We're before age 70.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.640]   So we don't have any,
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.400]   and maybe we're delaying social security hopefully, right?
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.300]   So we may not have much taxable income.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.360]   We have a little bit of interest,
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.140]   but we know it's a low yield environment.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.640]   So low dividends, low interest.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   So you look at our tax return
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.080]   and it looks like at least initially that we're poor.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.440]   All it is is that we're living off assets
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.960]   and we're not generating
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.160]   a lot of traditionally taxable income.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.600]   So we take advantage of the progressive tax rates, right?
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.660]   So we do Roth conversions
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.980]   where our income is maybe only taxed at 10%
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.100]   or 12% for federal tax purposes,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   maybe even 22% or 24%, right?
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.340]   So that's the first goal is just to take advantage
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.100]   of the luck of the draw before age 70.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.540]   We're not getting social security.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.660]   We're only getting a little bit of interest in dividends.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.980]   Let's throw some Roth conversion income,
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.540]   move money from our traditional account to our Roth account
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.760]   where it's tax-free while we're at a low tax rate.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.780]   The second thing we're trying to do is at age 72,
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.940]   you're probably aware,
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.260]   you have to take taxable requirement distributions
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.100]   from your traditional IRAs,
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.220]   traditional 401Ks, 403Bs, et cetera.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.420]   So we want those to be lower, right?
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.940]   Because if we can get that money
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.540]   from the traditional side of the ledger
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.260]   to the Roth side of the ledger,
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.180]   we're gonna have lower RMDs in our future.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.660]   We're happy with that outcome, right?
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.320]   The exercise here is to right-size those conversions.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.480]   People sometimes don't understand this.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.980]   You can convert a dollar or you can convert every dollar
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.760]   or anything in between, right?
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.660]   There's no income limit on the ability
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.160]   to do a Roth conversion.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.880]   Everybody, every American
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.920]   with a traditional retirement account
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.480]   can do a Roth conversion regardless of their income,
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.800]   but you wanna right-size it, right?
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.300]   And this is a subjective exercise, right?
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.080]   Because you have to coordinate,
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.800]   well, how much tax do I wanna pay now?
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.500]   'Cause I'm gonna have to pay tax later,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.800]   either me or my heirs.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.640]   Somebody's paying tax on this IRA at some point.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.720]   And I only wanna pay so much tax today.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   Maybe I'm, you know, I might be thinking,
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.880]   boy, they're gonna raise tax rates
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.520]   and my RMDs as I get older are gonna start killing me.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.240]   So what do I care?
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.360]   24%, go for it, right?
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.640]   Other people are gonna be a little more conservative, right?
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.180]   This really does depend on your circumstances.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.520]   So that first bullet,
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.580]   marginal federal and state income taxes rates,
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.460]   so important to consider in terms of
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.700]   whether you're doing these Roth conversions.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.420]   Could also be, hey, I live in California today
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.340]   and in three years, I'm moving to Florida.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.220]   Well, maybe I wanna hold off a little bit
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.260]   because maybe I don't wanna hit California income tax.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.540]   I wanna hit Florida where there is no income tax, right?
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.220]   So there could be plenty of considerations in this regard.
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.060]   And then the other thing to think about
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.220]   is coordinating with tax gain harvesting, right?
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.740]   Tax gain harvesting, which we talked about earlier,
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:50.740]   is dependent on keeping my taxable income low.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.340]   Well, my Roth conversions could blow me out
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.340]   so now my capital gains are taxed at 15%.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.540]   If I'm only motivated by tax
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.420]   and I can either do tax gain harvesting or Roth conversions,
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.780]   I'm generally gonna tell you to do Roth conversions.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.100]   And here's why.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.860]   The tax on the traditional IRA is coming due,
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.020]   period, end of discussion.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.980]   I might pay it during my lifetime
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.580]   or my heirs are gonna pay it.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.620]   We'll talk about the inherited IRAs in a little bit.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.540]   Somebody's paying that tax, right?
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.620]   The government's getting their piece.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.620]   My tax gain harvesting, on the other hand,
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.980]   maybe that tax is gonna get forgiven
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.820]   with the step-up in basis, right?
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.660]   So if my only consideration is tax,
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.060]   I'm gonna favor Roth conversions.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.820]   Now, it might be that I have
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.100]   an investment allocation consideration.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.060]   So I might have an old cat or dog.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.540]   I invested in some tech startup years ago.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.100]   It's got a huge capital gain.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.020]   I want a tax gain harvest out
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.100]   versus in my traditional IRA,
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.500]   I've got mutual funds that I really like.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.820]   Maybe in that case, I say no,
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.420]   I'm gonna do my tax gain harvesting
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.300]   instead of my Roth conversions
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.580]   and get a 0% rate on the tax gain harvesting
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.900]   and get my old tech stock,
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.860]   which I'm a little leery about now,
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.580]   into mutual funds that I like better
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.700]   from an investment perspective, right?
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.420]   So this is a tax planning presentation.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.820]   Of course, no investment advice in this presentation,
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.180]   but we always have to consider
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.140]   all sides of our financial life,
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.740]   and this is where tax and investment
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.220]   really can intersect.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.460]   Another thing to consider
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.220]   when we're doing Roth conversions
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.860]   is the Affordable Care Act premium tax credit.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.620]   This is if you're on an ACA plan, right?
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.660]   So maybe I'm on TRICARE or have other private insurance.
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.420]   I'm not on an ACA plan.
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.660]   Maybe I don't care about the premium tax credit.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.860]   What you wanna do is think about
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.420]   without Roth conversions,
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.260]   do I qualify for a premium tax credit?
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.100]   And where this really is gonna come into play
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.420]   for a lot of folks is in 2023,
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.500]   where you get a premium tax credit
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.340]   up to having adjusted gross income
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.860]   of 400% of your federal poverty level.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.580]   And the second you're a dollar over it,
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.460]   you lose the entire credit.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.500]   So this is, it's something to consider
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.300]   in terms of managing your taxable income
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.740]   so that you optimize the premium tax credit.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.660]   It only applies in those situations
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.580]   where you have an ACA plan.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.740]   And by the way, once you go on Medicare,
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.180]   you're not gonna have an ACA plan.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.740]   So this is not gonna be that big a deal
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.100]   for those already going on a Medicare.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.700]   You do wanna think about IRMA, right?
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.540]   So that's the increase in Medicare premiums
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.180]   that results from increasing your taxable income.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.860]   This is a bit of a marginal concern
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.740]   because yes, this exists.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.020]   And yes, if you blow through one of these,
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.060]   it's a little bit of a cliff,
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.900]   but it really only matters if you're right there.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.380]   I believe the first IRMA bend point is 176,000
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.980]   of adjusted gross income for a married couple.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.460]   So you don't want a Roth conversion
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.460]   to ever take you from $175,999 over the line, right?
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:11.340]   But before the line, and even within the line,
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.140]   it's a relatively modest increase.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.980]   And it does go up progressively,
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.940]   but so it's something to consider,
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.980]   but I wouldn't be losing too much sleep over it.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.140]   And then qualified charitable distributions.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.020]   Well, what the heck is a qualified charitable distribution,
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.780]   a QCD, and what does it have to do with Roth conversions?
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.460]   All right, qualified charitable distribution
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.820]   for the charitably inclined,
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.740]   another great planning technique.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:39.740]   The idea here is you donate to charity up to $100,000 a year
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.860]   with your traditional IRA,
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.020]   instead of with your taxable accounts,
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.180]   your checking account, Roth IRA.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.540]   And why do we do this, right?
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.180]   If we're 70 and a half and older,
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:54.780]   we can transfer up to $100,000 every year
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:59.780]   from our traditional IRA, and the money is not taxed, right?
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.380]   The whole point of doing Roth conversions
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.460]   is to get money out of traditional IRAs,
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.820]   so it's taxed where we want it to be taxed,
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.740]   as opposed to later when we may not be able
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.260]   to afford that tax, or that tax might be very high,
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.820]   or whatever it is, okay?
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.820]   The cool thing about the QCD is it's a way
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.940]   to bail money out of a traditional IRA and not pay tax.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.860]   Now, look, you gotta be charitably inclined, right?
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.100]   But I might be saying, look, in my 70s,
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.900]   I'm gonna give a certain amount to my church,
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.940]   no matter what, might as well do it
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.460]   out of your traditional IRA,
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.060]   because what it does is it bails that money
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.500]   out of that traditional IRA fully tax-free,
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.480]   up to $100,000 a year.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.820]   You don't get charitable deduction for it, but who cares?
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.780]   You're getting that big standard deduction anyway.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:50.080]   And, oh, by the way, QCDs do a couple things.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.660]   They satisfy my RMD, right?
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.340]   So, starting at age 72,
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.660]   I'm gonna have requirement distributions.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.500]   Guess what?
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.340]   If my RMD from my IRA is just, let's say, $50,000,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.540]   and I do a qualified charitable distribution out of my IRA
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.540]   to my favorite charity for $50,000,
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.180]   I don't have to take my RMD.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.260]   That satisfies it, right?
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.180]   It's a way to bail money out of a traditional IRA
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.580]   without taxes, and if I'm gonna be giving
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.100]   that $50,000 to charity anyway,
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.980]   might as well do it out of my traditional IRA
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.940]   instead of taking my RMD myself, paying tax on it,
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.140]   and then giving money to the charity, right?
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.460]   So, this is just a great idea.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.300]   And, oh, by the way, so the reason I bring it up,
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.020]   if you're before age 70 and a half,
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.220]   you definitely wanna think about this
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:46.060]   in terms of right-sizing your Roth conversions.
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:50.740]   Why convert every last dollar to a Roth
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.940]   if I'm gonna be making some substantial
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.140]   charitable contributions in my 70s and 80s, right?
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.780]   And then a little disclaimer,
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.660]   just don't accept any remuneration
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.100]   or trinket from the charity.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.780]   That can blow QCD treatment.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.220]   Very powerful planning technique.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.940]   I'm very fond of it.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.220]   Only applies if you are age 70 and a half, right?
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.980]   But you need to be thinking about it
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.420]   before you're age 70 and a half
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.380]   to right-size those Roth conversions.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:22.620]   All right, tax-efficient estate planning.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.460]   What are we talking about?
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.660]   What are we not talking about?
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.620]   We are talking about mostly income tax here.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.020]   For most people, the estate tax is not gonna bite.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.540]   Now, that could change.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.100]   I tend to doubt it.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:38.100]   Right now, your lifetime exclusion is $11.7 million.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.020]   So, most of us are not gonna die
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.340]   with $11.7 million worth of wealth.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.140]   Hate to break it to you.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.220]   But that said, pretty much everybody
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.980]   with any sort of substantial assets
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.580]   needs an estate plan.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.260]   And we'll talk about some reasons why.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.220]   First thing is the elimination of the stretch IRA, right?
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.220]   The whole, the idea in the past was,
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.940]   oh, I've got an IRA.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.020]   My heirs have to take or require minimum distributions.
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.820]   I'm gonna leave it to the two-year-old grandchild.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.660]   He or she has to take and require minimum distributions,
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.500]   but it's based on them being two years old
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.740]   and then three years old and then four years old.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.220]   So, they have to take a pittance out of it every year.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.460]   And meanwhile, it grows either tax-deferred for an IRA
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.780]   or tax-free for a Roth IRA.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.260]   They used to call that the stretch IRA.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.540]   My grandchild could have like 90 years
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.460]   of tax-efficient income because of the stretch.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.180]   Boy, isn't that powerful.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.980]   Congress, you know, this was all over the news.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.860]   People knew about the stretch IRA.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:42.980]   And Congress said, no, we want some more revenue.
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.820]   So, here's what we're gonna do.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:49.300]   For most beneficiaries, we're gonna get rid of these RMBs
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.740]   other than this one rule.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.260]   We're gonna say for most beneficiaries,
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.580]   you're gonna now have to take the money out over 10 years.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.540]   There's no required minimum distribution
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.500]   other than at the end of the 10th year
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.860]   following the original account owner's death.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.700]   But otherwise, it has to come out in 10 years.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.740]   So, there's no more stretch IRA.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.980]   There's no more, I leave it to my grandchild
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.420]   and they get 90 years of tax deferral or tax-free growth.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.860]   Not doing that.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.300]   You gotta take it out in 10 years,
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.420]   whether it's a traditional or a Roth.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.900]   To my mind, this makes Roth conversion planning
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.460]   for those thinking about their heirs even more impactful.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:30.100]   There's not a lot that could be done to avoid this.
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.740]   You should leave it to your spouse.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.660]   There are things that could be done.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.060]   But if you happen to inherit an IRA,
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.220]   you now have a real financial planning issue
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.700]   that you either have to tackle or you need professional help
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.860]   because here's what you don't wanna do.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.140]   You don't wanna inherit an IRA, a traditional IRA.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.340]   Roth is different.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.340]   You don't wanna inherit a traditional IRA,
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.100]   do nothing, wait 10 years
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.700]   and then have to take out the entire amount.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.900]   That's gonna be painful.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.580]   You don't wanna plan your distributions every year.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.660]   One little potential planning technique here
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.420]   is get the inherited IRA
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:07.060]   into a properly titled inherited IRA account
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.220]   in the year of the original owner's death.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.660]   That is the function of giving you,
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.540]   instead of 10 years, you actually have 11 years,
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.460]   the year of death plus the next 10 years
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.700]   to empty that thing out.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.500]   It's a way to spread out the tax hit just a little more.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:25.340]   But anyway, we'll talk about IRAs a little more
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.060]   in terms of who you wanted to leave them to.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.140]   Two important things from a tax
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.300]   and an estate planning perspective,
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.980]   beneficiary designation forms, payable on death forms,
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.580]   make sure at all times you have up to date,
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.220]   on file beneficiary designation forms,
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.740]   absolutely critical in terms of just the estate planning
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.500]   in general and tax efficient estate planning in particular
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.260]   and then revocable living trusts.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.020]   I've blogged about this.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.180]   I'm a big fan of revocable living trusts
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.180]   in the right circumstances
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.060]   and they are great for real estate
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.820]   and they can be good for retirement accounts,
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.580]   but if and only if one of these two things applies,
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.460]   the intended beneficiary is a minor
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.980]   or the intended beneficiary
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.340]   has credit or protection issues, right?
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:16.340]   So if I'm 70 years old and maybe I'm a widow, right?
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.820]   I'm 70, but I'm a widow and or widower
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.460]   and I have three adult children, right?
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.900]   And they're in their thirties and forties
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.780]   and they're just regular people.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.660]   They're competent.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.900]   They don't work in high risk occupations.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.180]   They're just regular people.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.140]   I'm not gonna use, generally speaking,
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.460]   I'm gonna try to not use a revocable trust
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   to leave the retirement accounts.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   I'm just gonna name them directly as the beneficiaries,
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:51.420]   but in certain cases using a revocable trust can be good.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.460]   For the real estate though,
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.340]   the revocable trust can be very powerful.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.340]   Think about your beneficiaries.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.540]   Is it my elderly parents?
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.980]   Is it an out-of-state beneficiary, right?
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.100]   'Cause you could leave the house
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.260]   maybe through a will or through a trust.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:12.060]   The trust can sort of provide a lot of benefit
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:15.060]   to your loved ones when you leave it through the trust.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.700]   Let's just say, I'll just give you one example.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:21.180]   You own your house and maybe you're single
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.220]   and you leave it to your elderly parents.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.780]   And maybe somehow you die early.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.700]   Your elderly parents live out of state.
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.380]   Now your elderly parents have to come into your home state
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.740]   where they don't live.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.180]   They have to get your will probated
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.180]   so that they can get the house
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.780]   and then get the house retitled all out of state.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.220]   That is not a recipe for success.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.180]   It's gonna probably work a lot better
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.380]   if you put the house in the revocable trust
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.420]   and there are clear directions
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.260]   about how it should be disposed of.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.300]   It's gonna make your beneficiary's life a lot easier.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.700]   Gotta work with a lawyer, right?
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.820]   This is not a DIY type thing,
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.980]   but I definitely think there's some real advantages
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.860]   to the revocable living trust.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.660]   And then let's think about,
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:10.500]   let's think about our type of account
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.340]   and our beneficiary, right?
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.580]   So let's start off spouses, right?
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.580]   Spouses are the law's most favored beneficiaries.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.420]   They can inherit these days all types of assets
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.420]   in a tax efficient manner, right?
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:26.020]   So for most people,
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.980]   leaving most assets to the spouse in today's environment,
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.580]   I think makes a lot of sense, right?
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.460]   So, look for the ultra wealthy, yes,
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.900]   there can be absolutely be planning around spouses,
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.940]   but for most people who would not be stars
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.100]   of reality television,
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.820]   it's gonna generally be spouses
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.380]   the tax favored beneficiary
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.980]   and generally speaking how you might wanna go.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.860]   Let's talk about Roths, right?
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.740]   Roths are great assets to leave
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.220]   to any non-charitable beneficiary, right?
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.060]   Spouse, they're particularly good
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.140]   for your upper income beneficiaries.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:08.260]   So, if you have a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA,
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.460]   and you've got one child who's a teacher
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.660]   and another child who's the quarterback
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.500]   of the Kansas City Chiefs,
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.220]   the Roth would be great to leave to the quarterback.
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.660]   The traditional would be great to leave to the teacher
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.620]   because the teacher's at a lower tax rate, right?
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:27.020]   Just some little nickel dime planning like that.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.500]   Roths are not great to leave to charities.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.060]   Look, if you wanna be charitable,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.140]   don't have me tell you not to be for tax reasons,
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.020]   but if you're looking to be charitable and tax efficient,
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.660]   why waste the benefit of a Roth on a charity, right?
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:46.100]   Most beneficiaries today have 10 years of tax-free growth
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.580]   when they inherit a Roth IRA.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.300]   Even without the stretch, that's pretty good, right?
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.020]   If I inherit a Roth IRA,
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.940]   I can leave that in there for 10 more years
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.860]   of tax-free growth, at the end of the 10th year,
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.140]   take it out, and now, yes,
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.540]   the money will now generate interest and dividends
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.260]   in my taxable brokerage account,
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.260]   but for 10 years, it grew tax-free,
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:11.460]   and I get a full step-up in basis when it comes out, right?
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:15.420]   So, Roth is a great asset to leave
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:20.260]   to not, don't waste that tax attribute on a charity, right?
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.020]   Where you might wanna start thinking about charities,
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.660]   the traditional retirement accounts, right?
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.740]   So, if you're thinking about,
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:28.140]   I'm gonna leave a bunch of stuff to my adult child
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.380]   and a bunch of stuff to charity,
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.260]   and I have a Roth and a traditional,
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.300]   leave the Roth to the adult child,
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.660]   leave the traditional to the charity.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:39.420]   And traditionals are great for lower-income beneficiaries
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.580]   because they pay less tax
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.020]   than your higher-income beneficiaries.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.300]   And then, like I said earlier on the HSA side,
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:51.780]   HSAs are great assets to leave to a spouse,
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.860]   and they're great assets to leave to charities
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.940]   because those are basically the only two categories
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:00.340]   of beneficiary that doesn't immediately pay tax on your HSA.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.580]   Everybody else is pretty much paying a lot of tax
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:05.100]   when they inherit your HSA.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.380]   So, just some things to be thinking about
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.820]   from an estate tax plan.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.140]   Basically, a lot of what you're thinking about
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:15.180]   is your beneficiary's income tax situation,
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.340]   that bites, in today's environment,
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.780]   that bites much, much, much harder
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.500]   than any estate tax is gonna bite for 99.9% of Americans.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:29.660]   But here's one thing that should be on your radar.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.180]   And maybe in our audience,
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:35.260]   we have folks who are having parents now pass away, right?
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:36.340]   These things happen.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.540]   Essentially, we all have one tax planning opportunity
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.380]   in our life.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.220]   It's our death, and it's coming.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.460]   But one thing you do wanna think about,
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.780]   if you or your parents, your spouse,
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.700]   dies with any sort of affluence,
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.620]   even though they don't owe any estate tax, right?
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:59.260]   So, they owe much less than $11 million today.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.140]   Today's exemption is 11.7 million.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.260]   You still might want to, if they're married,
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.140]   you may wanna file an estate tax return.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.980]   That's a Form 706.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.300]   And the reason is this, portability.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.100]   So, what the heck is portability?
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:19.020]   Portability means that if the first spouse dies,
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:23.660]   the second spouse can get their lifetime exemption, right?
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.380]   So, spouse one dies in 2021.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:31.820]   He or she has this 11.7 million estate tax exemption.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:33.980]   They leave everything to the spouse,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.260]   so they don't even use the estate tax exemption.
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:42.260]   The surviving spouse can get that 11.7 million
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:44.500]   from the first spouse,
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:49.500]   if the first spouse's estate files this Form 706.
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.020]   So, and the Form 706 is just gonna report,
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:57.020]   hey, Joe Smith died in February, 2021.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.700]   He had $3 million worth of assets.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.060]   He left it all to his spouse.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.380]   Check a box.
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:08.380]   The spouse inherits an $11.7 million estate tax exemption.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:13.060]   30 years from now, spouse two dies, right?
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.300]   This happened in my own life.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.900]   My grandparents on my father's side died 40 years,
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.660]   yeah, about 40 years apart, right?
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.260]   So, these things happen, right?
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:26.220]   Who knows what that $3 million is gonna grow to
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.780]   by the time the next spouse dies.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:30.460]   Maybe it's 10 years, 15 years.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.980]   And, oh, by the way, they're thinking about
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.700]   lowering the estate tax exemption.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.140]   It's actually in the law right now,
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.220]   I think in 2025 or six, it lowers.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.060]   But it's only to the upside
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:47.060]   to leave the estate tax exemption to the surviving spouse.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.220]   The way you do that, though,
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:52.700]   you can't do that unless the Form 706 is timely filed.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.940]   So, just a little thought there.
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:59.820]   And then the last slide I've got is just,
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.380]   when you approach your tax situation,
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.700]   I think more and more people are getting this,
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.740]   but it's just something that is sort of,
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.660]   people haven't really locked into this.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.420]   There's a real distinction
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.340]   between tax planning and tax preparation.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.660]   And I think some people go to their tax return preparer,
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.180]   they say, okay, I'm engaging you to prepare
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.620]   my federal and state tax return for 2021.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.380]   And they expect that they're gonna get all this tax planning.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.580]   Well, I actually don't even think that's really that fair
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.900]   to the tax return preparer.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.980]   It's just, they're distinct exercises, right?
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.980]   Preparing one's own tax return is,
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.900]   it should be done correctly, but it's not tax planning.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.020]   And then I do have a blog post here
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.220]   that actually talks about,
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:48.660]   hey, I just did my tax return for 2020.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.020]   Could I use this as a tool
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.020]   to help facilitate my own tax planning?
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:57.300]   This little, this blog post has some tips and tricks
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.060]   to take out your old tax return
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.980]   and use it as a springboard to do some tax planning.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.900]   So I think that's it.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:09.580]   I hope, I'm gonna stop sharing.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:15.820]   So I hope we've got everybody still here.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.900]   I hope that didn't,
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.500]   hope we didn't lose too many in the battle.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.660]   So, Carol, I think there are some questions
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.540]   that have already come in.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.620]   - Yeah, thank you so much for that presentation.
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.940]   That was very informative
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.340]   and just the kind of information we're looking for.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.380]   Yeah, I'm gonna read a few of the questions
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:38.300]   that we have pre-submitted from the RSVP survey.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.500]   And then we'll have Jim and Miriam
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.940]   read a few of the questions from the chat.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.340]   And then after about 15 minutes of that,
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.900]   we're gonna open up to interactive Q&A
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.460]   where people can raise their hands.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:53.300]   I think you did cover quite a few of the questions
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.860]   that people had pre-submitted, like with Roth conversions.
[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.660]   Somebody did ask,
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.820]   discuss distribution strategies from inherited IRA
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.220]   subject to the 10-year rule.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.340]   So as if you're the person that got the inherited IRA.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.620]   - Great question.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.020]   And let's start with, upon death,
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.620]   you wanna work with the executor,
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.980]   whoever's running the estate around properly tidying,
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.980]   and/or the financial institution
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.180]   around properly tidying an inherited IRA.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.820]   Generally speaking, there's a little magic language
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.140]   around, you know, it's, you know, Joe Smith,
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.460]   decedent, you know, decedent, deceased,
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.860]   you know, 12/31/2021,
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:42.180]   IRA for the benefit of beneficiary name, right?
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.260]   There's, don't use that exact language,
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.860]   but there are resources to find that.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.820]   So you wanna get that inherited IRA
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.380]   properly titled as an inherited IRA,
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.460]   you know, sooner rather than later.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.020]   And then you wanna think about your distribution strategies.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.860]   And basically what you need to do
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.060]   is you need to say, all right, you know,
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.580]   I have a 10-year spread on this.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.300]   What was, what's my income this year?
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.660]   Did I sell a business?
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.020]   Did I have a big capital gain?
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.580]   Are there things that happened in my life
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:12.900]   where I'm gonna have more or less income this year
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.660]   versus other years in that 10-year window?
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.060]   And by the end of the year,
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.380]   take that right size, that distribution,
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.460]   so that you get the distribution in those 10 years
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.420]   in the right, you know, marginal tax bracket.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.700]   So you need to be thinking,
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.180]   once you've inherited an IRA with this 10-year rule,
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.980]   you now have a lot more tax analysis to do
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.420]   than most Americans, 'cause you gotta say,
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.380]   oh, I sold a business this year.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.660]   I had a big capital loss this year,
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.740]   whatever it is, and then take the right way.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.900]   The one thing you don't wanna do
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.940]   is just ignore the issue on a traditional IRA.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.060]   And then in year 10, you gotta take all of it,
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.260]   'cause that's gonna be a tax time bomb, so.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:58.140]   - Okay, thank you for that.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.420]   And now there are two questions on minimizing taxes
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.260]   that are kind of related,
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.820]   so I'm gonna read them together.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.100]   How to minimize taxes
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.500]   on a mostly fixed income stream during retirement,
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.780]   and how do you determine a tax-efficient order
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.020]   to withdraw assets in retirement?
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.500]   - Yes, great questions.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.900]   So on our fixed income in retirement,
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.180]   there's not a whole lot you can do around,
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.980]   I'm assuming the fixed income's like a pension, right?
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.860]   If that's true, there's not a whole lot we can do
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.740]   to minimize tax there.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.060]   Where we need to then shift our focus
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.060]   is deduction planning, right?
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:37.620]   So that could be things like doing a donor-advised fund
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.980]   so that we maximize our itemized deductions in one year,
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.420]   and then go back to the standard deduction in later years
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.980]   as opposed to just only being
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.660]   in the standard deduction every year, right?
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.500]   So deduction planning,
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.580]   that person might have a traditional IRA,
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.740]   so we might do like QCDs and those sorts of things.
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.620]   I will say fixed income is a little bit of a tough one
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.860]   because it's just a little more difficult.
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.980]   The other thing you could do is delay, right?
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:07.980]   So to the extent you can delay your pension,
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.500]   I tend to like that for clients because it does two things.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.580]   One, it buys us some early retirement years
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.020]   where we could do tax planning like Roth conversions,
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.340]   and two, it gives us more longevity insurance
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.180]   on the pension.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.180]   Now, pension's gonna have credit risk, right?
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.500]   So the more you delay your pension,
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.140]   the more credit risk you take on,
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:30.500]   but there is the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.300]   That's not gonna fully replace your pension.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.300]   But anyway, so that's sort of my thoughts on fixed income.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.180]   And then, oh, order of operations
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:41.140]   in terms of retirement distributions.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:44.540]   To my mind, it depends on when you retire, right?
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:48.580]   If you're retiring early,
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.580]   I actually like taxable distribution.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.340]   Living off the taxables early is something I tend to like
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.740]   because that limits us to interest dividends,
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.860]   capital gains from a tax perspective,
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.020]   and then we could do Roth conversions, right?
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.660]   So we sort of use the taxable accounts
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:09.140]   early in an early retirement as our life raft
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.580]   while we're doing Roth conversions.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.700]   And then we get, you know,
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.940]   maybe we spend down those taxable assets.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.060]   And what we do at that point
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.940]   is we've got a lot more in Roths,
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.660]   and then we sort of toggle between Roth and traditional
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.140]   managing our tax rate.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.700]   So that, I will say, this is one of those,
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.860]   your mileage may vary.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.940]   It really depends on your particular circumstances.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.300]   I mean, it happens, and I would say
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.340]   it's gonna happen less and less,
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.420]   but it certainly happens
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:39.500]   that there are plenty of Americans who get to age 56.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.700]   They're done with work mentally, maybe.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.700]   And, oh, what do you have?
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.980]   I have 2 million in IRA or 401(k),
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.580]   and I've got my house,
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.860]   and I've got 10,000 in my checking account.
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.700]   Well, you're basically gonna be
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.140]   taking taxable distributions.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.740]   And we can talk about 72(t),
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:59.740]   we can talk about separation from service at age 55 or after.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:02.300]   I mean, there are things we can do,
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.700]   but definitely your planning landscape
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.260]   is a lot more limited.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.140]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.340]   Is there a better way to handle
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.460]   estimated income tax payments
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.740]   instead of just doing the 110%,
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:20.100]   especially when there's uneven investment returns,
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.940]   which makes planning difficult?
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.300]   - Yeah, so great question.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:29.060]   For the year 2021, I'm actually very fond of the 110%.
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.460]   Here's why, for retirees.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.220]   So 110% for the uninitiated, right,
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:37.300]   is as long as I make equal estimated tax payments,
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.260]   get 110% of last year's tax,
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:43.060]   so the 2020 tax liability in for 2021,
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.820]   I can win the lottery, no problem.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.380]   I pay no, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.700]   I can make all the money in the world in 2021.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.500]   I make that 110% of 2020 estimated tax payment.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.580]   I'm in, like, I'll have to write a big check in April.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.860]   No penalties.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.260]   I like that for this year.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.380]   Here's why.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.980]   Last year, think about it.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.340]   I've seen this on clients' tax returns.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.220]   Dividends, interest, way, way down.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.020]   Capital gain distributions, way, way down, and no RMDs.
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.260]   So we have a lot of taxpayers out there
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.820]   whose income was artificially low in the year 2020.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:21.100]   So let's do that 110% in 2021,
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.860]   and then we write our big check in April of 2022 for 2021.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.780]   I will say, you know, outside of that,
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.540]   you have to go into that 90% safe harbor
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.700]   and you just have to be a little,
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.900]   you have to be a lot more precise
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.220]   because you have to estimate this year's taxable income
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.260]   as opposed to last year's,
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.620]   which I just grab off my tax return.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:45.580]   So 110% is not, especially in a low-yield environment
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.260]   where, all right, maybe I gave the government
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.780]   a little bit of an interest-free loan,
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.660]   but it's a low-yield environment.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:53.020]   It's not that bad of an outcome.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:57.220]   So for this year, I really like the 110%.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.980]   And then in the future, the only alternative is the 90%,
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.580]   or if you have W-2 income, right,
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:06.060]   you can use your W-2 to get those payments in.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.500]   Yeah, there's no real magic bullet
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.140]   other than if I can really well estimate my 90%.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.100]   Is there a second question that I missed?
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.500]   - No, no.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.420]   Now let me do one more from the pre-submitted questions
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.740]   and we'll go on to the chat questions.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.820]   The last one I have is,
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.340]   do you have any suggestions for retirement tax planning
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.860]   software for consumer use?
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:30.780]   - I actually don't.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.940]   So a couple of things on this piece, and I get it.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.100]   Folks love analytical tools.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:41.740]   So I believe projections are sort of a necessary evil
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.100]   of the financial planning world and the tax world.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.300]   That said, if we're doing the right things,
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.020]   we don't need to worry about projections so much, right?
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.500]   I just think about, you know,
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.540]   Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.100]   Now, yes, they have some analytics people
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.900]   predicting behavior and predicting
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.900]   what will happen on third down,
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.500]   but what they're doing is they're doing the right behaviors,
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.180]   the right preparation.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.940]   You know, Bill Belichick's not in his office
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:07.540]   agonizing over whether the Patriots are gonna be 14-3
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.180]   or 13-4, 12-5 this year.
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.780]   Do the right things and the projections
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.700]   become a lot less meaningful.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.540]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.580]   Okay, now we're gonna move on to some of the questions
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.860]   that were submitted during the chat.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:22.340]   Miriam, do you have any from the chat?
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.140]   - Yes, we have one question from Ben.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:30.140]   He said, "I have a former employer, traditional 401(k),
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:35.540]   a personal Roth IRA, and also a simple IRA.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:41.500]   Can I partially convert my traditional 401(k)
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.540]   to the Roth IRA?
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:49.420]   Does the ownership of a separate simple IRA cause any issue?"
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:54.180]   - So if you're looking to convert a traditional IRA
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:59.180]   or traditional workplace plan, a 401(k) to a Roth IRA,
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.700]   it's possible, but you're gonna have to work
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.500]   with your plan administrator, right?
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.500]   So one thing you could do is if the plan has a Roth 401(k)
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.900]   and you, you know, if it has a Roth 401(k)
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.180]   and allows Roth conversions,
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.060]   which I believe they generally do if they have a Roth 401(k),
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.540]   probably gonna be easier to do an in-plan conversion, right?
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.740]   The other option would be, right,
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740]   so you could do an in-plan conversion.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:28.780]   You might be able to do a partial, all right,
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.260]   401(k), send this to a Roth IRA.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.100]   You'd have to look at your plan rules
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:36.060]   to see if they'll allow a partial withdrawal like that.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.980]   Depends on your age, depends on their rules.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:43.260]   The other option would be roll over the old 401(k)
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.980]   into a traditional IRA.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.580]   Now you wanna be careful about that, though.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.020]   If you have employer stock in there,
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.700]   that may not be a good idea.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.580]   If you're relying on the separation from service
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:55.540]   at age 55 exception, that may not be a good idea.
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.740]   So you wanna be careful about that.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.300]   That's not just a slam dunk,
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.540]   but that could be an option as well.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.300]   And by the way, the simple, maybe the other option
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.220]   is convert the simple IRA to a Roth IRA.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.900]   Don't do that if the simple is only two years old or younger.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.100]   But once that simple is over two years old,
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.780]   generally speaking, you can convert the simple IRA
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.540]   without a penalty into the Roth IRA.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.980]   And to answer the question, no,
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.900]   having a simple IRA is no impediment
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.740]   to doing a Roth conversion.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:30.260]   It's just a little tricky when you have traditional 401(k)
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.580]   into a separate Roth IRA.
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.740]   That's where it can get a little tricky,
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.220]   but maybe an in-plan conversion
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.540]   would be a potential answer there.
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:39.860]   - Two points on that.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:44.260]   Could you explain the two years on the simple
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.420]   for those who may want to know that?
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:51.020]   And second, what about the pro rata with the simple IRA?
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.260]   - Yep, so a couple of things on that.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:59.460]   So simple IRAs have this nifty little rule
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:04.180]   that says if within two years of creation,
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:09.620]   you move it to any other account other than a simple IRA,
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.820]   you pay a 25% penalty.
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:14.180]   It's just this onerous rule out there.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.860]   It's a trap for the unwary.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:20.380]   So it's just, oh, I don't like, that's just annoying.
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.100]   Look, if you had the simple for 10 years,
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:22.940]   don't worry about it.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:25.580]   But yeah, so you don't want to be doing Roth conversions
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.780]   out of a simple if it's under two years old.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.100]   Be careful there.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.940]   And then the other question was the pro rata rule.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.740]   And the answer there is pro rata rule,
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.300]   if you have a simple IRA,
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.500]   you generally don't have non-deductible contributions
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.260]   inside a simple IRA.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.900]   So there would be no pro rata only actually,
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.100]   well, I take that back.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.220]   So if we had a simple IRA and only a simple IRA,
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.220]   no SEP, no SEP and no traditional IRA,
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.180]   then there is no pro rata rule.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.260]   Every dollar you convert or take out is just 100% taxable.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:05.860]   But let's say we had an old IRA
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.060]   with non-deductible contributions.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.060]   The simple IRA would actually attract
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.700]   some of that historic basis.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.300]   So I'll give you an example.
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:18.700]   You contributed 10 years, 5,000 a year
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.020]   to a non-deductible IRA.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:23.180]   So you have 50,000 in basis in the non-deductible IRA.
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.180]   And that's now worth 100,000.
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.740]   And then you have a simple IRA that's worth 100,000.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.460]   So 200,000 total.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.500]   Every dollar that comes out of the simple IRA,
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.100]   25 cents of it will be non-taxable under the pro rata rule.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.900]   So this illustrates how complicated this can get.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.460]   But basically, if you only have a simple IRA,
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.820]   don't worry about the pro rata rule.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.740]   It's just all taxable.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:48.100]   But if you have other traditional IRAs or SEP IRAs,
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.100]   the pro rata rule could come into play,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.340]   generally in a favorable way.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.500]   It'll attract some of that old basis
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.900]   and some of the simple IRA distribution
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.380]   or conversion will be non-taxable.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:02.340]   - Could you explain in one or two sentences
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.780]   what a simple IRA is?
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:07.980]   That's not the same as a traditional IRA.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.820]   - That's right.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:12.740]   A simple IRA is a employer-sponsored plan,
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.500]   self-employed or actual worker,
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.780]   where it's an IRA that you can defer money into.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.380]   I believe the limit is 13,000 right now
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:25.420]   and then a 3,000 step-up or additional contribution,
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.340]   catch-up contribution if you're 50 years old.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.580]   So it's almost like a hybrid
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.700]   between a 401(k) and a traditional IRA.
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.820]   You need an employer,
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:37.380]   whether it's self-employment or another employer,
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:41.340]   and it's 13,000 a year is, I believe, the current cap,
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.620]   and then 3,000 a year additional catch-up contributions.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.820]   It's only deductible, no raw simples,
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.380]   and it's for small employers
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.540]   where it's just an easy plan to maintain.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:54.420]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:58.500]   - Does Jim have any questions
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.060]   or do you have any more from the chat, Miriam?
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.660]   I'm not sure if Jim has any.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.180]   - One just came up about what are your thoughts
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:07.540]   about using a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.820]   for high-income earners targeting an early retirement?
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.060]   - Yeah, it can be a really good thing.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.860]   I mean, those things usually have a 10-year payout.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.500]   Sometimes I think I've seen a five-year payouts.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.420]   So the idea is basically what you're doing
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:24.900]   is you're moving income from a high-earning year
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.260]   to what is hopefully a lower-earning year, right?
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:31.620]   I mean, it's really that, especially for the early retiree,
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.380]   hopefully that's what you're doing.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:38.460]   And generally speaking, I think for the very high earners,
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.300]   yeah, why not?
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.460]   Why not defer while you're very high-earning?
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:45.780]   I mean, you may then come into some not so pleasant surprises
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.980]   with things like premium tax credit,
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:52.340]   but it may be, I mean, I've done the analysis.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:56.540]   I think premium tax credit is like a 13 or 14% tax.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.980]   That's what's coming to mind.
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:00.380]   If you blow through that,
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.220]   maybe you wouldn't have qualified anyway,
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.820]   and then it's not really a tax.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.460]   So I have to look at any one particular
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.900]   deferred compensation arrangement and plan.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.140]   The other thing you want to think about
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.220]   is creditor protection, right?
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:19.220]   So this is a bit of a, it's not that big a deal,
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.180]   but on the deferred comp,
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.900]   sometimes there could be some issues.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:25.260]   If your creditor, or I'm sorry,
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:28.060]   if your employer was to ever have a credit issue,
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.500]   they get sued for something.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.500]   Theoretically, it depends on the nature of the plan.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.740]   There are some plans where that could be an issue
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.060]   where the creditor could actually access it.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.980]   So you just want to be a little careful with that,
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.500]   understand what you're getting into,
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.580]   but otherwise they can be good plans.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:50.460]   - We probably have time for one more question from the chat.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.540]   Is there a good one?
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:52.380]   - Yes.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.220]   - Okay, great.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.060]   - There is.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:59.420]   - This is from M.A.R.
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.020]   In the tax harvesting example,
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:03.820]   I guess that you gave, Sean,
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:06.620]   does the 40,000 taxable income
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:10.540]   include the income from the sales of the stock?
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.580]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.660]   And generally speaking, yes, right?
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.380]   So it's not like, oh, I had no income, right?
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.660]   I have no interest, no dividends.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.140]   I'm early retired.
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:23.260]   Oh, I'm in the 0% capital gains bracket.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.780]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell,
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.860]   I'm going to trip a $200,000 capital gain.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.540]   No, you've got to manage the gain
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:30.780]   with all your other income.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:33.060]   And that's why, that is a bit of a governor on it.
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.860]   But look, if you're married and 80,000,
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.460]   you have $10,000 capital gain,
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.180]   you're looking to wash away,
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.500]   you know, it can be very powerful.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.820]   But yes, it is not a mechanism
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.540]   to be washing away $500,000 worth of gain.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.340]   - Maybe time for one more?
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.380]   - One more.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:51.220]   - Yeah.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.900]   Any suggestions for a consumer version
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.180]   of tax forecasting software to use
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.540]   to optimize the Roth conversion
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.700]   and other tax planning issues?
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:00.740]   - Yeah, like I said,
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:04.140]   I don't endorse any particular product in that.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:06.180]   You know, I think, I mean,
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:10.140]   some of it is quite mechanical, right?
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.740]   I mean, literally what you do
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.100]   is you pull out the tax brackets for the year,
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.660]   and then you look at,
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:20.740]   are you in the itemized deduction or standard deduction?
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:24.140]   By the way, 90% of Americans are standard deduction, right?
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.860]   So that's a great guidepost.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.300]   And then I just say like, be a little conservative.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:32.020]   The other thing too, is people sort of misunderstand this.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.020]   This is an issue of degree, right?
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.460]   So what I mean by that is,
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:40.020]   let's say I've got $9,000 left in the 12% tax bracket.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:43.700]   And I think I have 10 or 12,000 left.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:46.100]   So I do a $10,000 Roth conversion.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:50.380]   Okay, the first nine is taxed at 12% federal.
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:55.380]   And then the last 1,000 is taxed at 22%.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.620]   Yeah, to my mind, that's not that big of a miss, right?
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.900]   Okay, I went a little over.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:03.780]   Some of it got into the 22%.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:04.620]   By the way, I mean,
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.100]   this is another thing to keep in mind too,
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:10.340]   is your future self is never gonna be annoyed at you
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.100]   that you paid a little too much tax on a Roth conversion.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.540]   Your future self is gonna be thrilled
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:18.660]   that they have a ton of tax-free income
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.540]   to draw on retirement.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.580]   And they are not going to be angry that,
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.140]   "Oh, you did some Roth conversions
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:27.360]   "that weren't 100% optimized.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.220]   "You paid a little bit of tax in the 22% bracket.
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.260]   "How dare you?"
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:35.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:37.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.260]   you
