[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Pastor John, last time on Wednesday,
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.440]   I played an old sermon of yours
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.040]   and we talked about healing.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.700]   God has promised to heal our bodies.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.240]   He could heal us today if he wants to,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.240]   but he has a timeline for that healing.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.680]   And until then, for most of our ailments,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.900]   we groan inwardly, awaiting the redemption of our bodies.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.840]   This waiting is what we saw in Romans eight.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.840]   But you balance that waiting with a faith-filled eagerness
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.880]   for God's healing mercy to be experienced today as well.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.280]   And that point leads us to consider how much trust
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.600]   we should put in faith healers
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.560]   and healing ministries today.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.320]   And if we avoid them, are we doing so
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.600]   because those ministries are fraudulent
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560]   or because we simply lack faith that God heals today?
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.800]   The perceptive question comes from Dana,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.940]   a woman who listens to the podcast.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.460]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.000]   I would certainly call myself a skeptic
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.200]   toward healing ministries,
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.000]   but I'm left wondering if this is unbelief in me.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400]   Jesus said to his followers,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.440]   "Whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.080]   "and greater works than these will he do,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.480]   "because I am going to the Father."
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.160]   That's John 14, 12.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.140]   After the ascension, this amazing promise
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.960]   carries over to every single believer, you said, in APJ 63.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.580]   That's amazing.
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.960]   But how does this promise of Christ
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.880]   relate to healing ministries today?
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.800]   I could attend a healing meeting in a church in my area
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.240]   and I'm in need of healing and deliverance,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.880]   but I cannot do this until my skepticism is addressed.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.660]   And if these people, these faith healers,
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.100]   are really doing the work of God,
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.920]   I don't want to disobey Him by my skeptical unbelief.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.580]   Pastor John, can you help me?
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.760]   As you can imagine, it is difficult to give counsel to Dana
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.760]   when I don't know the nature or the degree of her skepticism
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.840]   and I don't know anything about the healing ministries
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.600]   that she is thinking about going to.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   So let me speak more generally about first the text,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.960]   John 14, 12, and then the possible legitimacy
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.800]   of the healing ministry and the kinds of questions
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400]   you might want to ask about that.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.280]   In John 14, 12, Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   "whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.640]   "And greater works than these will he do
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.140]   "because I am going to the Father."
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.040]   Now, she alluded to the fact that in APJ number 63,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.480]   we gave a whole session on this text.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.360]   So I'm not gonna defend my interpretation again.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.080]   There's a whole sermon on it, by the way,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.160]   at Desiring God called "Doing the Works of Jesus"
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.400]   in my series on the Gospel of John.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.480]   So let me just give my summary here.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   This text is not about people who have the gift of healing.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.000]   We know that because Jesus said, "Whoever,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.080]   "whoever believes in me will do the works that I do
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.120]   "and greater works."
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.920]   This is true of every believer.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.200]   But 1 Corinthians 12 says that only some
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.080]   have the gift of healing.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.480]   Are all teachers, do all work miracles,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.440]   do all possess gifts of healing, do all speak in tongues?
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.640]   The answer is no.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   So what makes John 14, 12 so puzzling
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.760]   is that it's true of every believer.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.220]   Every believer does the works of Jesus.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.100]   That's scary, right?
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.080]   Every believer does the works of Jesus
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   and every believer exceeds the works of Jesus.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.800]   That's what the verse says.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.280]   It's not like there's a select group.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.320]   Well, somebody attained to it finally.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.960]   The second thing that makes this so puzzling
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.720]   is that nobody, underline nobody,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.960]   has ever in the history of the world
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.320]   exceeded the works of Jesus.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   If the supernatural wonder of the miracles
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.040]   is what's meant, turning water into wine,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.560]   healing everyone who comes to you without fail,
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.360]   feeding 5,000 with five loaves and two fish,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.320]   walking on water, raising the dead,
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.240]   casting out demons with a word,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.920]   infallibly, nobody has ever come close
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.640]   to this kind of consistency and awesomeness
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.360]   of miraculous work.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.360]   So how do all Christians exceed the works of Jesus?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   That's what is perplexing about this verse.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.460]   And my answer, defended in that number 63
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.480]   and in that sermon, is this.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.600]   We exceed the works of Jesus.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.280]   We go beyond the works of Jesus
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.480]   by living in the power of the Spirit,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.820]   the Spirit of the risen glorified Christ
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.480]   that Jesus himself poured out
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.800]   and thus pointing people to the glory
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.160]   of the crucified and risen Christ
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.680]   so that through faith in that risen Christ,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.080]   their sins might be forgiven
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.600]   by believing in the crucified and risen one.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.000]   That's my answer.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.240]   In other words, what's greater
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.940]   is that Jesus has now died for sinners
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.440]   and risen from the dead,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.720]   and he is reigning at the right hand of God
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   so that by the power of the Spirit,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.240]   we can point people to the risen and glorified Christ
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.440]   where they can find forgiveness of sins.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.380]   Jesus never did this.
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.100]   This is greater.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.640]   He had not died or risen from the dead.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.940]   He didn't point people to have specific faith
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.620]   in his crucified self or risen self.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.160]   We get the superior ministry of pointing people
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.320]   by our lives and by our words
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.760]   to the risen and glorified Christ.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.240]   So I don't think Dana should make her decision
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.360]   about the validity of a healing ministry
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.960]   on the basis of this verse.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.800]   I don't think they're connected.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   There are better ways for her to assess
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.920]   this healing ministry than to use
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.120]   the controverted John 14, 12.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.240]   I would suggest five kinds of questions
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.120]   to ask about the people she calls faith healers.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.580]   First, what do they believe?
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.320]   What's their theology?
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.080]   Are they doing their ministry in the service of truth
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.640]   or in the service of error?
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.600]   What do they believe about the nature of God
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.960]   and the way he saves sinners
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.040]   and the way he sanctifies the church?
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.400]   What do they believe about Christ
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.780]   and what he accomplished on the cross?
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.880]   What do they believe about the Holy Spirit
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.440]   and about the ultimate purpose of God in the world?
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.720]   And if they are hesitant to talk about these things
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.280]   or to provide written materials, that's a problem.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.480]   Lots of people want spiritual power these days,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.920]   they always have, without loving biblical truth.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.100]   Give me the power.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   I don't care what's true.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.040]   I just wanna be able to heal people or raise the dead
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.780]   or make something amazing happen.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.160]   But power without truth will almost certainly
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.480]   damage the cause of Christ in the end,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.360]   even if miracles are happening.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.200]   And yes, miracles happen a plenty
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.360]   in the hands of unbelievers.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.800]   And they will at the end of the age,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.000]   Paul says in 2 Thessalonians 2.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Second, is healing the body the goal of their ministry
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.760]   or is healing a means to the end of glorifying Christ
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.680]   and sanctifying human life
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.540]   and building up the local church?
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.240]   I've attended healing services
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.400]   and it seemed to me in some of them
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.760]   that it became quickly clear
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.600]   that the word of God was subordinate
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.940]   to what they consider power encounters.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.240]   Wherever the word of God was simply used
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.280]   as a kind of brief priming of the pump,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.960]   in fact, that language was even used,
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.040]   the priming of the pump of power.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.300]   So I'm gonna use a little bit of a homily here
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.040]   to prime the pump of power that we can all enjoy at the end.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.360]   My trust level in those situations went way down.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.200]   All the physical miracles of the New Testament
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.880]   serve to confirm the word of truth
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.040]   and the glory of the saving word of God.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.440]   If these get turned around,
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.480]   the long-term effect is going to be unhealthy.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.320]   Third, do the faith healers believe
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.280]   that God's will is for every sickness
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.000]   of every believer to be healed
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.980]   and that the reason they're not is because of lack of faith?
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.580]   That's a hallmark of many faith healers.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.640]   They believe that faith will always heal
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.240]   and that if you're not healed,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.080]   it's because you are defective in your faith.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.560]   And I would say this simply does not fit
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.260]   with the Apostle Paul's teaching about the suffering
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.760]   and groaning of this age
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.600]   as we wait for the redemption of our bodies.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.560]   God can heal and he does heal
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.480]   and we should pray for healing always when we get sick
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.380]   or we love somebody who's sick,
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.060]   but he does not teach us that we are God
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.360]   as if healing lay decisively in our hands.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   If we can just muster enough of this so-called faith.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.560]   Fourth, do these faith healers rank physical wholeness
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.380]   above treasuring Christ through pain?
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.960]   That is, do they think that the miracle of physical healing
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.960]   is a greater miracle than the miracle of strong, joyful,
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.400]   unwavering faith through sickness and pain?
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.300]   Do they see that both of these are wonderful miracles?
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.180]   Do they see that the miracle of faith
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.120]   in the face of suffering may be a greater miracle
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.100]   than the removal of suffering?
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.220]   Medicine can remove suffering,
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.520]   but no human medicine can produce Christ-exalting faith
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.780]   in the face of suffering.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.420]   How do they think about this?
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.940]   Finally, number five is just a personal question to Dana.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.260]   Have you asked the elders of your church to pray for you?
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.820]   James 5, 14 says, "Is anyone among you sick?
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.420]   Let him call for the elders of the church
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.500]   and let them pray over him,
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.740]   anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.860]   I say this not only because that may be the way
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.740]   God gives you healing, Dana,
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.340]   but also because in those encounters
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.580]   with the leaders of the church,
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.100]   God may give them wisdom
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.940]   as to whether a healing ministry is advisable
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.080]   or not in your case.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.340]   So let me end with this.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.800]   When 1 Corinthians 12 says that the Holy Spirit
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.320]   gives to one faith to another gifts of healing,
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.500]   to another the working of miracles, and so on,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.820]   in verses 7 to 11,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.820]   don't assume that the Spirit's giving those gifts
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.120]   is locked in to specific people.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.860]   It doesn't say that,
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.580]   which means you don't know through whom
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.420]   you might receive healing when a person prays for you.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.980]   They may be given, anybody may be given a gift of healing.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.260]   The word is always plural, gifts of healing.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.980]   They may be given a gift of healing.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.940]   Therefore, perhaps the question before you
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.020]   is not only whether you should go to a so-called
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:31.020]   faith healer, but also whether you should go to a trusted,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.120]   spiritually-minded friend,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.020]   and very seriously and earnestly ask them
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.580]   to put their hands on you and pray
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.440]   that they would receive a gift of healing
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.020]   that they could impart to you.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.540]   - So good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.140]   And as I sit and listen to you,
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.420]   I'm reminded of a previous APJ episode we released earlier
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.380]   on this connection between faith and healing.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.020]   I'm thinking of APJ 1425, an episode we titled
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.460]   "Did My Dad Die Because I Lacked Faith?"
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.860]   Great content here.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.260]   If you want more on the relationship of faith and healing,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.060]   you can find that episode, APJ 1425,
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.020]   and you can find about 1,800 other episodes
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   all at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.100]   Well, on Monday, we have a pair
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.380]   of really good Bible questions
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.080]   that at first don't really seem related.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.020]   Namely, what does it mean that Christ is all and in all?
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.260]   And what role does racial difference play
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.300]   in the church today?
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.020]   Those questions are not unrelated
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.140]   because they both come to us
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.860]   from Colossians 3, verses 9 to 11.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.860]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.700]   See you then.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.180]   (Thanks for watching)
