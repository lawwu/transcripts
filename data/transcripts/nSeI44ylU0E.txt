[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   We are engaged at the moment, as most of you will remember, in studying verses 9 and 10
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.400]   in the tenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.440]   The tenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, verses 9 and 10.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.880]   That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.080]   heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved; for with the heart men
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.200]   believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.320]   Now we've spent a number of Friday evenings on this statement because it is such a crucially
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.840]   important one, which as we've already seen, affects evangelism, affects our understanding
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.640]   of salvation, affects probably the whole course of our Christian life.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.240]   That's why we've had to spend this time.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.640]   We've divided it into three sections.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.000]   First of all, what is the content of saving faith?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.320]   What we've got here is a definition of saving faith, the faith by which a man is saved.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.320]   What is the content?
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.020]   We've considered that.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.440]   We must believe that Jesus is the Lord and that God hath raised him from the dead, and
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.520]   all that is included in those two statements.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.680]   But then, having considered that, we've gone on to consider in the second place what we
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.600]   may call the character or the nature of saving faith.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.440]   And here we have seen that the emphasis is upon the heart.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.180]   The apostle repeats it, "Shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.420]   the dead.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.240]   With the heart men believeth unto righteousness."
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.040]   And it's obvious, as we've shown, that the great apostle not only uses the term heart
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.980]   but repeats it in order to underline it because it is of very vital and crucial importance
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.620]   that we should realize that the heart enters very vitally into this whole matter of believing
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.620]   unto salvation.
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.020]   Or, in other words, the heart is a vital part, plays a vital part in saving faith.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.140]   Now we've approached it like this, that the trouble with men is never really in his
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.780]   mind but in his heart.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.980]   And belief, we were able to show, is rarely not a matter of the mind but of the heart.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.100]   And in the same way, we began to show last Friday night how belief also is essentially
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.300]   a matter of the heart and that we must reject teaching such as that of the Roman Catholic
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.780]   Church, which makes it purely intellectual, and certain others who teach at the present
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.540]   time who say the same thing.
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.060]   We saw indeed that we all have got to be very careful, that the Church has been led astray
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.380]   many times in our history by failing to understand this and by making belief something purely
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.380]   intellectual.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.060]   It's a danger that confronts many of us who are interested in Bible study and in theology
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.060]   and doctrine.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.340]   Very well, so we ended last Friday night by adducing a large number of statements from
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.900]   the Scripture in which we see so clearly that the heart is rarely central in this whole
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   matter.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.940]   Very well, then, we are now in a position to ask a question.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:40.700]   What then does true belief or a saving belief rarely include?
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.980]   We've been pointing out negatively so far that it isn't merely a matter of the intellect,
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.900]   that the apostle takes up this word "heart" in order to bring out that point and in order
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.700]   to emphasize it.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.980]   What then does a true saving belief rarely include?
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.140]   You see, what we are doing is we are showing the difference between a mere intellectual
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.740]   assent to a number of propositions and what the Bible rarely means by believing on the
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.820]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.780]   This has been a great snare always, that we substitute merely accepting or agreeing with
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:33.740]   our minds an intellectual assent for what the Bible means by faith and by a true belief
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.220]   in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.260]   So we are now able to ask this question.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.940]   What does a saving faith, a true belief, rarely include?
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.220]   Well, now, of course, we've got to start by saying that it obviously and clearly starts
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.220]   with the mind.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.460]   Now it starts with the mind because, after all, what we are dealing with is truth.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.420]   And truth is something that comes to the mind and to the understanding and should be addressed
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.420]   to that.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.540]   There's a statement that we have already considered in the sixth chapter of this epistle
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.140]   to the Romans and in the seventeenth verse, which puts the whole thing very perfectly
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.140]   in one verse.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:20.980]   "God be thanked," says the apostle, "that you were the servants of sin, but you have
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:29.540]   obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.660]   You see, the apostle says, "Your position, you Roman Christians, once upon a time was
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.860]   this.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.820]   You were the servants of sin.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.100]   You are no longer the servants of sin."
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.420]   "Well, what are you?"
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.580]   "Well, you've become quite different," he says, "and for this reason.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.180]   The truth was delivered you.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.460]   You heard the preaching of the gospel.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.900]   The facts concerning our Lord and their meaning were put before them."
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.940]   And the gospel was preached to them.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.100]   And obviously that is something to which one listens with one's mind.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.580]   We are told constantly in the book of the Acts of the Apostles that the apostle would
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:16.620]   go into a synagogue on the Sunday and there he would reason out of the scriptures, reason,
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.700]   proving and alleging, demonstrating, arguing it out.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.340]   He would take Old Testament scriptures and their prophecy and then he would show their
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.020]   meaning and how all this had been fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.900]   Now all that is a process that is addressed to a man's mind.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.860]   So that the first thing that is involved is the mind, the intellect, the understanding.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.460]   That I take it now then is quite clear to all of us.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.460]   It isn't clear to everybody, of course.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.100]   There are people who go to meetings just to get a feeling.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.300]   And they don't bother to listen really, they want a feeling.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.060]   And they're always looking for feelings and sensations.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.740]   That's not the Christian way.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.820]   The first thing always is the mind, the intellect, the understanding.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.740]   It is God's greatest gift to man.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.220]   And therefore it is the first thing which is addressed by the truth, by the preaching,
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.340]   by the presentation of the gospel.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.060]   But having been clear about that, and I trust we all are perfectly clear about that, we
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.620]   should be because we've been spending all these nights in working out the connotation
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.660]   and full significance of the terms "Jesus is Lord" and that "God raised him from
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.660]   the dead."
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:34.420]   We go on to say that it doesn't stop at the mind, that it doesn't end with the intellect,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.540]   that it isn't only a matter of the understanding.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.540]   What else?
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.140]   Well, our very term "heart" really tells us all we need to know.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.100]   It means that the whole person is included.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.740]   The entire person.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.140]   When a man becomes a Christian, every part of him is involved.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.020]   Very well, so that we can divide it up like this.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.820]   The truth is, we've listened to the truth and we've heard it and we've been able
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.620]   to receive it with our minds.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.860]   But that doesn't go far enough.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.780]   With the heart, men believeth unto righteousness.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.980]   So there's something else that is involved.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.980]   What is that?
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.180]   Well, there is an element of conviction.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.700]   Now, what is conviction?
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:32.260]   Well, conviction means that the truth has come to us with power.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:38.380]   We've not merely been aware of it and not only been able to see what it is.
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.900]   We don't remain in that position, we don't remain as we were.
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.220]   So there is this element of conviction which means that the truth has come to us very powerfully.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.380]   Now, truth doesn't always come powerfully.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.060]   You can listen to a man speaking, take an obvious illustration from the realm of politics
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.980]   in these days of by-elections.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.980]   You can listen to a man speaking on behalf of a party to which you don't belong and
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.780]   with which you don't agree.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.740]   Well, you can apprehend intellectually what he's saying, but it doesn't touch you.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.380]   He doesn't convince you.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.660]   He doesn't move you.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.060]   You do nothing about it.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.940]   You found it quite interesting.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.140]   You were able to follow him quite intelligently and you can tell what he said.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.140]   But it's nothing more than that.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.980]   You haven't been caused to change your position from one party to another.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.860]   It's left you exactly where you were.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.540]   It was a kind of entertainment, if you like.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.340]   You've got an intellectual apprehension of what the man's been saying.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.620]   Now, there are many people who listen to the gospel like that and it never goes further
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.620]   than that.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:48.140]   Indeed, it is possible for a man even to have a certain amount of enjoyment in that,
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.860]   but it never does anything in the matter of conviction.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:57.700]   But when the heart is involved, there is always an element of conviction.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:04.100]   In other words, the truth comes to us and we're not only aware of it, but it challenges
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.500]   us.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.060]   It disturbs us.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:15.540]   It not only allows us to think in a passive and a detached manner, we become engaged in
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.740]   it.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:23.260]   We have the feeling that it is speaking to us directly and speaking to us as persons.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:29.260]   Now all this is involved in what is called conviction.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.980]   We are no longer merely spectators, taking our seats and looking on and being aware of
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.980]   what is happening.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.660]   We are involved in it and it's doing something to us.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.980]   It is speaking directly to us.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.780]   And it is rarely convicting us.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.300]   By that I mean that it is making us examine ourselves.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.120]   It causes us to question everything that we've hitherto believed.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:05.040]   We may have been actively and militantly opposed to the truth, or we may have been quite indifferent.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.180]   It's never meant anything at all to us.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.980]   But when the truth comes with conviction, it affects us and involves us.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.780]   If we've been militantly opposed to it, we begin to query whether we've been right.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.500]   We begin to feel uncomfortable.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:27.020]   Or, if we've just been quite passive and unaffected at all and uninterested, it now
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.740]   begins to make us think, "Well, how can I have been guilty of neglecting this for so
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.740]   long?
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.020]   How is it that I've never realized before that this is something that's got to do with
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.020]   me?"
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.320]   Now, that is what's involved in this process of conviction.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.600]   We begin to realize that this is something that is of vital concern to us, of vital import
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.480]   to us, and that we have rarely got to pay attention, because it is speaking to our whole
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.640]   condition as human beings and as persons.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.160]   That's what's meant by conviction.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.480]   The reality of the thing suddenly takes hold of us.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.840]   Now, I don't know your background, but there are probably many here who've been brought
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.560]   up from childhood to go to a place of worship and to listen to the gospel.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.880]   At a certain age, you didn't even listen.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.120]   You spent your time amusing yourself in various ways.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.040]   You got over that, you got a bit older, and then you began to listen in a very general
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.760]   sense.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.520]   But you may have gone on like that for years.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.360]   It is only when suddenly you have a feeling, "But this is tremendously important to me."
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.920]   You'd never realized that before.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.120]   You thought, "Oh, well, that's for people who are interested in it.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.120]   That's for the older people."
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   And it had never come to you as an individual and as a person, giving you the idea that
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.040]   it was of great concern to you yourself.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.720]   But at last you begin to listen for yourself, and you find that the truth is challenging
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   you and making you think and making you reconsider all your ideas and your whole position.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.480]   Then of course, you come to the next step, which is involved in this engagement of the
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.400]   heart in this matter.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:15.040]   And that is that you come to what is called repentance.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.720]   Now conviction is not repentance.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.240]   Conviction leads to repentance.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.880]   But you can even be convicted without repenting.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.840]   While you're convicted, you may be annoyed by the truth.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.400]   You may resent it because it's disturbing you, because it suggests that you're wrong,
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.480]   because it suggests to you that you ought to change and you don't want to.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.720]   You're under conviction, but you may be intensely miserable, most unhappy, most antagonistic
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.400]   to the truth.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.000]   And still you can't leave it alone, and it won't leave you alone.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.600]   But then you go on, I say, to repentance.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:59.520]   Now repentance means, at any rate, two main things.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.160]   And the first is that you change your mind.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.340]   Repent.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.200]   It means, that's a Latin word, which means think again.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   So it's obvious that a man whose heart is involved in this, is a man who, as I say,
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.720]   under the conviction, is not only made to think again, and to think more seriously,
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:30.960]   and to think in a more personal manner, and on a deeper level, he's made to think until
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.160]   he sees that he's wrong.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.040]   And he changes his mind.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.120]   Now there is a classical illustration of this in one of our Lord's own parables.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.600]   So perhaps the briefest and the best thing we can do is to read our Lord's parable
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.840]   about the two sons.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:57.440]   It's found in Matthew's Gospel, chapter 21, beginning at verse 28.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.200]   What think ye?
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.520]   A certain man had two sons.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.960]   He came to the first and said, "Son, go work today in my vineyard."
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:13.960]   He answered and said, "I will not."
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.260]   But afterward, he repented and went.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.280]   He came to the second and said likewise, and he answered and said, "I go, sir," and
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.480]   went not.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.560]   Which of the father of them twain did the will of his father, they say unto him, "The
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.560]   Father."
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.320]   Jesus saith unto them, "Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.520]   into the kingdom of God before you.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.000]   For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.480]   But the publicans and the harlots believed him, and you, when you had seen it, repented
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.940]   not afterward that ye might believe him."
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.120]   But this is the interesting one.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.080]   The first son, we shall have to come to the second one, I hope, next Friday night.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.600]   Take the first son tonight.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.160]   He said to his first son, "Son, go work today in my vineyard."
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.760]   He answered and said, "I will not."
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.760]   He refused.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.800]   He resented his father's interfering with his plans.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.840]   He didn't want to do this.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.200]   He had arranged to do something else.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.440]   He said, "I won't."
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.520]   But afterward, he repented.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   What happened?
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.240]   Ah, he thought again about it.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.120]   Instead of going away with his friends to spend the day, he stopped.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.720]   And he began to ask himself questions.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.440]   He thought again, repented.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.720]   He said, "Was I right in speaking to my father like that?
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.000]   Was I right in saying, 'I will not,' to my father?"
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.320]   You see, he stops and re-examines the whole thing.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.560]   He didn't just leave it.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.960]   He thinks again.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.600]   And not only that, he came to the conclusion that he was wrong.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.520]   Afterward, he repented and went to the vineyard.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.320]   He did the thing he said he wouldn't do.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:04.600]   So he not only thought again, he changed his mind, didn't he?
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.480]   At first he didn't agree with this.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.080]   Then he did agree with it and he went.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:16.240]   So you see, the second element in this process of repentance is a change of mind.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.440]   And that is the Greek word for repentance, metanoia.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.000]   You don't only think again, but you think in such a way that you change your mind about
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.560]   the thing, come to a different conclusion.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.000]   And that is a very vital part of believing with the heart.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.560]   Unless there's a change in the opinion, change in the outlook, change in the point of view,
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.480]   there's no repentance and there's no true belief.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.040]   Being aware of what the gospel says without it having any effect upon you doesn't mean
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   saving faith.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.440]   That's of no value at all.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.760]   It must affect the person, it must challenge us, it must question us.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.000]   We must know this, fight this opposition.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.840]   Then we come to the point when we change our minds, take another entirely different view.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:11.580]   So that is a vital part of this engagement of the heart in this whole matter.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.960]   But even that isn't enough.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:25.080]   You cannot change your mind and change your opinion with regard to the things of God,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.440]   God's whole plan of salvation and your whole relationship to him.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   You can't change your mind about all that without feeling sorrow for ever having held
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.760]   the wrong view.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.920]   There's no question that this first son in the parable, when afterward he thought again
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.200]   and went over the whole thing and saw that he was wrong, that he shouldn't have spoken
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.360]   to his father like that.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:55.080]   He was sorry, he was grieved, he was hurt with himself that he could possibly have spoken
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.560]   like that to his father.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.480]   And he feels it so much that he goes to the vineyard.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.160]   Sorrow.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.720]   There is always this element of sorrow in repentance.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.520]   You see the heart, as we saw in our definition, includes the mind, the seat of sensations,
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:18.240]   the feelings, what we commonly call the heart, and as well as we shall see, the will.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.680]   But the heart, the feelings, are of necessity involved.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.080]   Now let me give you again the best statement that I am aware of in the whole of the New
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.300]   Testament on this particular aspect.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:38.420]   The Apostle Paul himself, in 2 Corinthians chapter 7, he deals with this very matter.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.460]   Let me start reading at verse 8.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:47.900]   He says, "For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:54.940]   For I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:03.620]   Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:11.140]   For you were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:19.340]   For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.300]   world worketh death.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.700]   For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.300]   What carefulness it wrought in you!
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.900]   Yea, what clearing of yourselves!
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.300]   Yea, what indignation!
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.820]   Yea, what fear!
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.820]   Yea, what vehement desire!
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.820]   Yea, what zeal!
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.900]   Yea, what revenge!
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:45.420]   In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.460]   Now this is very important.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:58.420]   No man can come to see that his whole relationship to God has been wrong, that his attitude to
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:05.100]   God has been wrong, that he's been rebellious, that he's been defiled, that he's brushed
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.020]   aside God's greatest act in giving his only begotten Son to the death of the cross, meant
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.020]   nothing to him.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.340]   No man can suddenly realize that he's been guilty of all that without feeling intense
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.180]   sorrow, godly sorrow.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.180]   It's essential.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.420]   So you see my dear friends, if you and I have listened to these great truths all our lives,
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:32.980]   and we've never had any sorrow in our hearts because of our failure to see these things
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:39.420]   and to be moved by them, well I say we have no right to think of ourselves as saved people.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:46.380]   You can't have saving faith without knowing something about godly sorrow, the sorrow that
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:54.180]   you've ever grieved God, the sorrow that you've ever treated God, who's been so kind and gracious
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.380]   in the way that you've done.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.060]   You can scarce forgive yourself.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.340]   What indignation, says Paul, indignation with yourself.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:10.900]   And if you've never felt that you're unworthy, if you've never hated yourself, well I think
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.620]   you'd better examine the foundations again.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:23.660]   The Christian is a man who hates himself because he sees that he's a miserable, vile, rebellious
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:32.380]   sinner against a holy, loving God, his maker and his creator, godly sorrow.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.060]   It's an essential part of it.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.060]   The heart is engaged, the feelings and the sensibilities are involved.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.860]   But then we go even beyond that.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:50.580]   You notice the apostle uses there the word fear, and fear comes into it.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.900]   You remember we've got a classical example of this again in the preaching of the apostle
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.140]   Peter on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, the first sermon ever delivered in a sense
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.180]   under the auspices of the Christian church.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.780]   Peter is preaching to them, this is what I read in Acts 2.37.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:12.620]   Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:17.420]   the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   Fear.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:24.660]   They've been convinced, they've been convicted, they've been convinced, they've seen how wrong
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.660]   they've been.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:30.580]   He says, "Look here," he says, "you've crucified the Messiah."
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.380]   Peter puts it to them quite plainly.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:39.460]   "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken and
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.140]   by wicked hands have slain him."
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.340]   He brings it home to them, and they see it's right.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.860]   These were the people who cried away with him, "Crucify him, give unto us Barabbas."
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.940]   Now they suddenly realize what they've done.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.580]   Peter makes the same point later on when he preaches to them in connection with the men
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.580]   healed at the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.380]   And you see in their agony, in their fear, in their terror, they cry out saying, "Men
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.500]   and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.260]   And of course, exactly the same thing happened with the Philippian jailer.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:20.940]   The earthquake and all contributes to it, and then he comes and sees Paul and Silas
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.500]   and the other prisoners still there, and he's on the point of committing suicide.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.780]   Paul cried with a loud voice saying, "Do thyself no harm, for we are all here."
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:36.140]   Then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.940]   Silas and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.940]   That's how he said it.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.940]   He was filled with terror.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.540]   Now, let's be clear about this.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.180]   I'm not saying that there must be the same amount of terror in all cases.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.100]   That's not what I'm saying at all.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.700]   But what I am saying is this, that there is no such thing as saving fear, a saving faith
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.140]   without an element of fear in it.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:10.420]   I'm not postulating what amount of fear, but I am saying that I cannot possibly regard
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.300]   a man as a Christian unless he's ever had this element of fear.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.620]   Fear because he's sinned against God.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:23.340]   Fear because he realizes that he's in the hands of God and that God is a holy and a
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:28.260]   just and a righteous God and that he's got to stand before God in the judgment.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.820]   If a man knows nothing about the fear of death and of the judgment, I cannot see how he can
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.980]   be a Christian at all.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.980]   Fear.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:41.860]   Oh yes, it's a vital part of saving faith.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:48.380]   A man begins to realize, as he's never done, the holiness of the Lord, the absolute character
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:55.860]   of its demands, and that he and all others are unrighteous and unworthy and unclean.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.500]   In some way or another and to some extent or another, to some intensity or another,
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:06.660]   he cries out to the apostle Paul, "Whom shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:11.740]   He's afraid of the destruction that comes upon the ungodly.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.740]   The Bible is a terrifying book.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:21.260]   It's meant to be, because we all of us are sinners and we need to be awakened.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:30.580]   You remember how the Puritans of three hundred years ago used to emphasize this a great deal.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:36.780]   Joseph Allen's book, "Alarm to the Unconverted."
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.460]   You can't be a Christian unless you know something, in some degree, some measure of
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.340]   this very element of alarm.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.100]   "Sinners in the hands of an angry God," preaches Jonathan Edwards.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.100]   Why?
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:57.740]   Well, because it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, as Hebrews
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.740]   10 tells us.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.540]   It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.660]   I have a feeling that what is the matter with so much of Christian life today is that men
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.180]   and women have never known anything about this element of fear.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.100]   It's made so easy, so quick, so glib.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.180]   You just repeat a formula, you're in, they say.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.780]   Where's the fear, my friends?
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.420]   Where is the godly sorrow?
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.300]   I've even heard men boasting about the absence of fear.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.340]   They say, "You know, the wonderful thing was in that campaign, people went forward.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.740]   There were no tears, they had got smiles on their faces."
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.740]   Where was the fear?
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:40.780]   Where was this godly sorrow, this element of fear?
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:48.960]   You cannot have any glimpse of an understanding of the holy character of God without feeling
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   an element of fear.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:57.340]   Isaiah, who was a very godly man, when he had the glimpse, you remember, he says, "I
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.820]   am undone, I am a man of unclean lips."
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.940]   John fell down as one did when he had his vision.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:12.540]   The sight of holiness must be alarming to sinful creatures.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:18.700]   If we know nothing about fear and alarm, it is just a measure of our ignorance of the
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.220]   being and the character of God.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.620]   Oh, yes.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:29.220]   It is with the heart that men believeth unto righteousness, and the heart knows this fear,
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.340]   this alarm, sometimes acute and terrible terror.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.380]   John Bunyan knew it for eighteen months.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.460]   I'm not saying you need be eighteen months in that state.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:46.940]   All I'm asking is that the element of fear must have come in, must be there still.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.500]   Very well, we go on beyond that.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.260]   The next thing, obviously, is this, desire for deliverance.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.180]   "Who shall deliver me?
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.180]   Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.900]   Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   Desire for deliverance.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.420]   You see, the man who just sits and listens intellectually, he never feels any desire
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.420]   to be delivered.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.020]   He's not being convicted.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.100]   There's nothing to be delivered from.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.300]   He says, "What's that man getting so excited about?"
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.700]   People come here on Sunday nights, and I'm told at times they say that, "Well, it just
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.380]   means they've not been convicted.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.900]   Their hearts haven't been engaged.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.700]   They can give an account of what I've said, but it hasn't penetrated.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.980]   They haven't felt it.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.380]   The spirit hasn't applied it to them."
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.220]   So they don't see any need of deliverance.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.440]   You see how important all this is?
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:47.020]   This is one of the factors that controls whether you call for immediate decisions or not.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.820]   If you have the true view of saving faith and belief, you will know this, that when
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:58.100]   a man is convicted by the Spirit of God, he is going to seek out help.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.660]   You needn't force him to.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.660]   He'll have to.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.660]   He'll be so miserable.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.660]   He'll be so frightened.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.100]   He'll be so alarmed.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.980]   Do you remember reading that account of the revival in the Congo?
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:16.820]   That book that was published a few years back by the World Evangelization Crusade?
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.740]   There was nothing more striking in the whole of that book to me than this.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.900]   One of the men wrote, one of the missionaries wrote, and this is what he said.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.000]   He said, "I'd been there 20 years, and I'd been preaching, he said, I'd been preaching
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.620]   my heart out and appealing to people to come forward, and I couldn't get anybody to come
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.620]   forward."
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:37.340]   Then while he was away doing something else, the revival came and broke out.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.640]   And when he got back, this is what he found.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.380]   Not only did they not have to ask people to come forward, they had to restrain the crowd
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.940]   that was coming forward.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.660]   The difficulty was to deal with all these people who, in their agony of conviction,
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.460]   were demanding help and release.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.020]   And you'll find that frequently in the accounts of revivals.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:02.060]   I remember, as I'm speaking of that great occasion at Kirk of Shots in Scotland, when
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:07.540]   John Livingstone preached that one sermon which led to the conversion of so many.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.180]   And that was the thing that could be heard all over the countryside, people groaning
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.940]   in agony, asking for release, knocking at the door of the minister, keeping him up all
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.300]   night, because they were frantic.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.300]   Desire for deliverance.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:25.620]   Again, don't put too much emphasis upon the degree or the amount of feeling, but unless
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.300]   you've ever had a feeling, "Who shall deliver me?
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   I can't.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.300]   I've tried.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.820]   I've taken my resolutions and my vows.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.820]   I can't keep them.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.820]   I'm a failure.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   I can't save my...
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.820]   Who can save...
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.900]   Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.900]   Desire for deliverance.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.900]   It's an inevitable part of believing with the heart.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:48.340]   And then it leads to the next thing.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:56.180]   The trust and the confidence in our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.740]   You see, I'm not saying believing in him only.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.740]   I started with that.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.460]   That's the intellectual part.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.260]   I'm now dealing with the heart.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.980]   It's the mind that sees the truth intellectually.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:14.620]   I'm now dealing with this other element, trust, confidence, reliance upon him.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:22.020]   Now this is a really vital part of the definition of what is meant by belief, by faith in the
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.020]   New Testament.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.420]   Let me give you a quotation.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:29.340]   Some of you may use the Amplified New Testament, which is a very good translation, and I commend
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.340]   it once more.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.900]   The Amplified New Testament.
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.700]   I think you can get it in the book room.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:39.060]   Now, the Amplified New Testament, in translating this very passage we are dealing with, and
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.420]   in the introduction to the whole of the book, says this.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.860]   This is its definition.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.740]   It says that the Greek meaning, the original Greek meaning of faith is this.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:59.580]   To believe means to adhere to, to cleave to, to trust, to have faith in, to rely on.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.580]   That's it.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.180]   And that's exactly what it is.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:10.180]   You see, in your fear, in your alarm, in your desire to be relieved, and you can't do
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.740]   it yourself, you can't find anybody, suddenly you see this one, and you believe the truth
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.700]   about him that he is the Lord, that God has raised him from the dead, and you come to
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.380]   this conclusion, "He is able to do it for me.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.380]   Who shall deliver me?
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.660]   I thank God through Jesus Christ my Lord."
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.400]   You trust him.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.740]   You cleave to him.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.100]   You adhere to him.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.500]   You rely upon him.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.100]   You have faith in him.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.100]   All that is involved.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:41.540]   I'll take the same kind of definition which is given by Professor Burkhoff in his systematic
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.980]   theology or reformed dogmatics, whichever they call it now.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.260]   He defines it like this.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:53.940]   Faith, he says, saving faith, is a certain conviction wrought in the heart by the Holy
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:34:03.780]   Spirit as to the truth of the gospel, and a hearty reliance, in brackets, trust, on
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.340]   the promises of God in Christ.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.580]   That's it.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.380]   It is a certain conviction wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit as to the truth of
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:21.980]   the gospel, and a hearty reliance, trust, on the promises of God in Christ.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.100]   It's more than being aware of the truth.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.260]   It is a reliance upon it.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.620]   It is a committal of yourself to it.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.060]   It is an abandonment of yourself to it.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:36.980]   It is a casting yourself utterly and entirely upon it.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.660]   Now, let me give you a statement which really says all that.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.660]   Take Hebrews 11.6.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:54.820]   "He that cometh unto God must believe that he is, yes, but also, and that he is a rewarder
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.220]   of them that diligently seek him."
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.220]   That's it.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   It's included in that.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:08.300]   He's got this reliance, this confidence, and therefore he trusts himself to it, he
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.260]   commits himself to it.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.700]   Now, this is an essential part of saving faith.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.100]   You can believe with your mind that Jesus is the Son of God, you can have your head
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:24.280]   packed with theology, but unless you've ever felt your need of a Saviour, and unless
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:29.180]   you've committed yourself utterly to him, and you rely only upon him, and give yourself
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.740]   to him that he may save you, you haven't got saving faith.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.700]   With the heart.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.380]   And this is an essential part of it.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:45.260]   And that in turn, of course, leads to this.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:55.660]   That one is conscious of a sense of rest, and a sense of peace.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.100]   This is quite inevitable.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.420]   You can't have had this conviction and the fear and all I'm talking about, and then
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:09.940]   see that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one appointed of God and sent of God in order
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:17.860]   to do for you everything you need, you can't believe that without immediately feeling rest
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.460]   and peace.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.900]   Being justified by faith, as Paul has already told us in the fifth chapter of this epistle
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:30.940]   to the Romans, and in the first verse, being justified by faith, we have peace with God
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.940]   through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.380]   There is an element of rest in faith.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.100]   The seeking has come to an end.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.340]   You have found him.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:46.420]   Oh, happy day that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.500]   'Tis done.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.820]   The great transaction's done.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.380]   I am my Lord and he is mine.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.020]   The rest of faith.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.220]   It's always there.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.740]   It must be there.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:06.660]   One element of rest and of peace, and added to it, of course, the element inevitable of
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:13.940]   thankfulness, of gratitude, and of prayers.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:19.900]   How can anybody believe that the Son of God has left the courts of heaven and come on
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:27.060]   earth and endured all he did, even to the extent of dying in agony upon the cross, and
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.220]   to be buried in a grave and rise again?
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:35.580]   How can one believe that he's done all that for me and not feel thankfulness to him?
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:41.780]   And gratitude and praise and thanksgiving.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.540]   With the heart men believeth unto righteousness.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:50.980]   You see, the character of this truth is such that once a man realizes what it is and his
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.940]   relationship to him, all that I've been saying is inevitably involved.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.020]   You can't help yourself.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:03.060]   And what the apostle is saying is this, that this is therefore the test which we apply
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   to ourselves.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:11.140]   Now, once more, the epistle to the Hebrews gives us quite a good exposition at this point.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:16.860]   In the eleventh chapter and the thirteenth verse, where he's talking about these great
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.740]   giants and heroes of the faith.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:25.180]   These all, he says, died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.220]   afar off and were persuaded of them.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.340]   And here's the word I want, embraced them.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:37.660]   They embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.780]   And the word embraced really means greet them, welcome them.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:47.100]   And that's the ultimate of greeting, isn't it, and welcoming, that you embrace the person
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.100]   whom you are greeting and welcoming.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   That's what these men did with the promises.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.500]   And that is what made them the men they were.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.260]   And that is what believing with a heart rarely amounts to, that you don't do it in cold
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:04.020]   blood, you don't do it unmoved, you don't do it undisturbed, you don't sit on in a
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.580]   detached manner and say, "Well, I accept that doctrine and therefore I'm a Christian."
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.580]   Not at all.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:14.100]   You've been through these steps and stages, conviction, fear, alarm, desire for deliverance,
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:19.500]   recognition of him, casting yourself upon him, thankfulness and praise, glorying in
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.940]   him, greeting this truth, desiring to know more and more about it.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:30.860]   Now that is what the apostle means then when he tells us that if thou shalt believe in
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:35.700]   thine heart that God has raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.580]   For with the heart men believeth unto righteousness.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:49.260]   Now let me give you a quotation which will perhaps sum up all this for us.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:56.020]   Many people think of John Calvin, the 400th anniversary of whose death is celebrated next
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:01.820]   year, as a cold, harsh, intellectual theologian.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.180]   But listen to what he says about this.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:12.940]   He says, "The seat of faith, it deserves to be observed, is not in the brain, but in
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.940]   the heart.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:19.540]   Not that I wish to enter into any dispute concerning the part of the body which is the
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.500]   seat of faith.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:30.060]   But since the word 'heart' generally means a serious, sincere, ardent affection, I am
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:39.660]   desirous to show the confidence of faith to be a firm, efficacious and operative principle
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:52.500]   in all the emotions and feelings of the soul, not a mere naked notion of the head."
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.260]   That's very good, isn't it?
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.900]   And that is the simple truth.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.020]   That's exactly what the apostle Paul is trying to tell us here.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.580]   Well you see, the final conclusion we come to about it is this.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:12.020]   That saving faith is not a natural quality which everybody possesses.
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.300]   I've heard people teaching the truth about faith like this.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.900]   They say, "Everybody's got faith.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.900]   Everybody's born with faith."
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.140]   I remember a man using this illustration.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.660]   He was preaching in the provinces.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.100]   He'd come down from London.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.100]   I was in the meeting.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.780]   He said, "I'll tell you what faith is."
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.780]   He said, "Now when I finish here next Thursday night, I shall travel back on the train to
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   London.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.780]   I've already booked my sleeping berth."
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.820]   He said, "How do I put myself down to rest on that bed in that sleeping berth?"
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.380]   Well, he says, "I've got faith in the engine driver."
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.380]   That faith.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.220]   So he says, "What you need to do is to take that faith which you've got and everybody
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:54.380]   else has got, and you apply it, you turn it in the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.340]   There's nothing to stop you doing it.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.660]   If you only accepted this testimony, then turn your faith to it.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.660]   That's saving faith.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.020]   But it isn't.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.660]   Saving faith is a matter of the heart.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:14.920]   And as the heart of man is desperately wicked and deceitful by nature, and as we have already
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:22.700]   seen that the natural mind, which means heart, is enmity against God, is not subject to the
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:28.540]   law of God, neither can be, when you realize that it's true to say of us all that we
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:36.500]   were dead in trespasses and sins, that we must be born again, that the natural mind
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.860]   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.420]   can he, because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.340]   It's not you saying we've all got the faith we need.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.340]   We haven't.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.340]   None of us have got it.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:56.940]   By grace are we saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.980]   It is the gift of God.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:11.860]   Saving faith is something that is wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:17.020]   This natural man was supposed to have the gift of faith.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.940]   How can he believe in the Son of God?
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.220]   He doesn't believe that he's a sinner.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.220]   He doesn't know that.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.220]   He knows nothing about God.
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.300]   He's utterly opposed and antagonistic to the truth.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.140]   He needs to be changed before he can believe it.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:41.660]   Faith is the first active positive demonstration that the soul gives that it is born again.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.740]   Before a man can believe, his heart must be changed.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:55.220]   The natural heart is dead, rebellious, antagonistic, regards all this as foolishness.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:02.620]   It is only the man who has become spiritual who can believe these things, nobody else.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:08.380]   "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered the heart of men the things which
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.180]   God hath prepared for them that love him."
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.820]   He's already said the princes of this world didn't know it and they rejected it, but
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.700]   God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:24.180]   "For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:29.340]   We have received, he says again, I'm quoting 1 Corinthians 2, 12, we have received not
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:36.820]   the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit that is of God, that in order that we might
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:43.700]   know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:55.900]   Romans 9 and 10 are inevitable in view, Romans 10 verses 9 and 10 are inevitable in the light
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.080]   of the argument of Romans 9.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.500]   It is with the heart that men believeth, and before he can, the stony heart is to be taken
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:11.180]   out and he must have a heart of flesh.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.740]   It's not merely an intellectual matter, it's not taking this natural faith we all
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.700]   have and switching it to Christ.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.540]   We haven't got this faith.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.240]   It is the gift of the Spirit of God.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:29.140]   It is the work that he does in the soul, in the heart of men.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:41.660]   And without that, saving faith is a sheer and an utter impossibility.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.220]   Men believeth unto righteousness.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:51.820]   He's a new man and he's not only been aware of the truth, he has felt its power.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.460]   It has changed him.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.380]   And so he has gone through the steps and the stages which I've been trying to indicate
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.380]   unto you.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.300]   God willing, we'll continue with this next Friday night.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:10.380]   O Lord, our God, we come unto thee once more and lift up our hearts in praise and in thanksgiving
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:17.660]   and in humble acknowledgement that we are saved by grace and that not of ourselves.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.620]   It is the gift of God.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.800]   We acknowledge, O God, freely, that it is all of grace.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.080]   We are aware of our unworthiness.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:32.620]   We say with him who wrote, "And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Saviour's
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:33.620]   blood?
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:40.700]   Died he for me who caused his pain, for me who him to death pursued amazing love?
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:44.580]   And can it be that thou, my God, hast died for me?"
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.140]   'Tis mystery all.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:54.680]   O Lord, we leave ourselves in the grip of this glorious mystery.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:47:03.280]   We humbly thank thee and praise thy great and holy name that we are what we are solely
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.840]   by the grace of God.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:13.800]   Thou hast indeed taken away the stony heart and given us a heart of flesh to know thee
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.520]   and to love thee.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:26.120]   Lord, it is my chief complaint that my love is weak and faint, yet I love thee and adore
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:31.360]   all for grace to love thee more.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:38.120]   Now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:44.120]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:52.440]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.880]   Amen.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.800]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
