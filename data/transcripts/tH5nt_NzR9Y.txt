[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Another week is upon us here at the Ask Pastor John podcast and we start the week on a somber note
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.140]   Rodrigo from Brazil writes in to ask of this Pastor John
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.680]   Hello, I've seen your effort to combat the terrible abortion policy that has literally ripped apart thousands of precious lives
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.000]   Jesus says let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.640]   So my question is do aborted babies go to heaven
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.260]   Even not having the chance to be born and to piggyback on this question in recent online debates
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.720]   Critics of the pro-life movement say that if aborted babies do go to heaven
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.220]   Then why is abortion really a big deal in the end for Christians? What would you say Pastor John?
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.560]   Well, I have argued
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.400]   numerous times
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.560]   that
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.520]   infants who die
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.120]   Do go to heaven and the articles and sermons can be found at Desiring God by simply searching to infants who die go to heaven
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.840]   I do believe they are in a sinful condition when they die. I don't believe
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.760]   Believe that they're saved because there's no original sin. That's not what I'm arguing
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.320]   My view is not based on how cute or innocent they are
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.640]   It's based largely on God's apparent commitment to a kind of public justice in which
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.500]   He makes the rejection of observable
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.760]   evidences of truth the basis for his final condemnation
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.840]   Romans 1 20, but that's that's not what I'm arguing for now in this answer
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm just going to assume that Rodrigo can go to
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.080]   The website and get more on that. I'm gonna tackle. Why would you oppose abortion?
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.280]   If you thought you were sending many many babies
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.960]   wonderfully to heaven
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.880]   To put it the way Rodrigo put it in recent online debates
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.160]   critics of pro-life say if aborted babies go to heaven
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.480]   Then why is abortion really a big deal in the end for Christians?
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.400]   And my answer is it is a big deal for six reasons at least
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.240]   Number one, it's a big deal to kill babies in the womb because murder is a big deal
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.560]   We know it's a big deal because the reason capital punishment was inaugurated by God after the flood
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.600]   Was because of how big a deal it is to murder someone
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   Who's in the image of God?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.120]   Genesis 9 6 whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed for God made
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.080]   Man in his own image. That's what makes it such a big deal. You don't kill
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.280]   Beings uniquely created in the image of God number two
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   It's a big deal to kill the unborn to try to justify
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.560]   murder by the
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.760]   heavenly destination of of the one being murdered because the same
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   Justification could be used for a one-year-old or a two-year-old who are incapable still of processing and construing
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.520]   God's revelation. So if Christians were to buy the argument sure, that's fine
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.720]   you can go ahead and take the lives of of
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.040]   Infants in the womb because they're gonna go to heaven then we can just go around kill all the one-year-olds and guarantee they go
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.840]   To heaven kill all the two-year-olds and guarantee that they go to heaven and and we'll draw the line maybe around
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.800]   I don't know three or four. That's a horrific
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.000]   Position to take and is it a big deal number number three?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.360]   It's a big deal to justify murder that way by the heaven-bound
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.640]   Destination of the one being murdered because the same thing would be used in to justify killing Christians
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.080]   Let's just let's go out and convert people then kill them quick before they can commit apostasy or backsliding
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.040]   it's a
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.000]   Horrible logic number four. It's a big deal to kill those who committed no crime
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.760]   Just in order to dispatch them to heaven because the Bible addresses this very kind of twisted thinking
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.840]   When it says shall we sin that grace may abound?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.280]   In other words somebody was trying to use the logic
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.160]   against Paul that
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.880]   Grace would abound wherever sin abounds. And so well goodness gracious. Let's do some more sin and
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.800]   Paul
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.040]   Responded shall we do evil that good may come God forbid. So his answer is no. No, it's it is a wrong
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   Logic to sin in order that some good might come from it. We're dealing with God here. Not just pragmatics
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   Number five it is a big deal because life on earth is good and wonderful
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.080]   It is a right thing to want to be alive on the earth and the Apostle Paul when he weighed
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.840]   dying and going to be with Jesus and
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.680]   Staying alive and serving the church. He opted to stay alive. Here's what he wrote
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.920]   For to me to live as Christ and to die as gain
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.800]   If I'm to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me at which I shall choose. I cannot tell I'm hard-pressed
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.920]   Between the two my desire is to depart and be with Christ for that is far better
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.200]   Okay, so that that would you well then just choose death for goodness sakes, but he says verse 24
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   but to remain in the flesh is
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   More necessary on your account
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.280]   Convinced of this. I know I will remain and
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.120]   Continue with you all for your progress and joy in faith
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.240]   So it is far better
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.720]   He says to be with Christ in one sense if it's just me and my sufferings that are being taken into account
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.920]   Please Lord, I would rather be home
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:20.040]   But if I take into account my ministry my relationships the good I might do in glorifying God and serving
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   People for the season that he gives me here on the earth
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:31.480]   Larger purposes are in mind and we ought not to to take that a possibility away from anyone
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.400]   So if there's an unborn person, we shouldn't say oh, well, they get to go to heaven
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.040]   So don't give them any chance to serve God on the earth that that doesn't follow from biblical
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.200]   Reasoning and lastly it's a big deal because it is
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.320]   presumption to step into God's place and
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.560]   Try to make the assignments to heaven and to hell
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.520]   God is the judge not us our duty is to obey God not play God
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.240]   So yes, babies do go to heaven I believe and no don't kill them
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:12.000]   because they're in the image of God and because earth is their home on the way to heaven and
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.960]   Rightly, so and because we are not God
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.720]   Amen, very good. Thank you pastor John and tomorrow
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.480]   We return to the abortion topic and talk about whether or not Christians can in good conscience
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.000]   Pay taxes to a government that subsidizes the abortion industry
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.560]   It's an important question on the table and for everything related to this podcast
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.520]   You need to know go to desiring God org forward slash ask pastor John. I'm your host Tony Reinke
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.920]   I'll see you tomorrow on the ask pastor John podcast
