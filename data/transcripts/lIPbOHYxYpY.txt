[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.140]   This podcast launched nine years ago yesterday on
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.420]   John Piper's 67th birthday.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.220]   Amazing.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.600]   I'm so grateful to God for his sustaining grace over these nine years.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.740]   Uh, someone recently alerted me to the fact that I have now been the host of
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.220]   this podcast for exactly 20% of my life.
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.800]   Amazing.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.300]   The years have flown by.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.320]   Pastor John is no longer 67.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.520]   He's now 76 as of yesterday and still at it.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.640]   Uh, to celebrate his birthday, we look back on his life today through the lens of
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.840]   a question when we get a lot, should I become a preacher?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.080]   It's a question we get from many men who are thinking about vocation, calling,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.400]   and whether ministry is the path laid out for them and in making such a big
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.360]   decision, many factors must be weighed in.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.320]   Of course, a true in Pastor John's case as well.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700]   He shared the story of his path into the pulpit in a new series of preaching
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.320]   videos we released on YouTube.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.180]   Uh, those videos were filmed back when Pastor John was 71 years old.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.460]   The videos though are now online and you can find them all on YouTube.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.320]   Just go there and search for the preaching class.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.860]   Uh, you'll find a playlist comprised of 31 videos.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.760]   But today I want to feature the audio from one of the early episodes in that
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.400]   series, a lecture, lecture number one titled the making of a preacher.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.920]   It gets at this question.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.960]   Should I become a preacher?
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.680]   Here's Pastor John's story.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:51.840]   The longer I live and I'm age 71 right now, the longer I live and think about
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.480]   ministry, the more I believe in the power and the preciousness and the necessity of
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.160]   preaching in the life of the church.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:12.800]   Some of you are watching this maybe age 40, 50 as a businessman, wondering if you
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.000]   should become a preacher.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.320]   Others of you might be 15 years old, others in school, in college or seminary.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.240]   And what I thought might be helpful to do immediately in this series on preaching is
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.520]   to tell my story.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.960]   You might call it the making of a preacher because it's a story of quite significant
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.640]   improbabilities and you may feel that way about yourself.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.720]   And so let me give you the short version of the things in my background that stand
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.320]   out to me as difficult and obstacles to preaching and yet which turned out to be, I
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.920]   think, the very forge in which God fired and made a preacher.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.080]   So let's start at seventh grade.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   Right around seventh grade, I discovered the fact that I couldn't speak in front of a
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.520]   group without freezing.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.600]   Now, this is not your ordinary butterflies that everybody jokes about.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.200]   It's not your funny knocking of the knees and, oh, you'll get over it.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.080]   This was a paralysis.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.640]   This was really deep.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.200]   I, to this day, do not understand what it was, where it came from, why it was there in
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.600]   its entirety anyway.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.600]   The full explanation, I think I know part of why God did it.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.120]   But there I am now entering junior and high school, junior high and high school, and
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.280]   terrified in a paralyzing kind of way of any kind of public speaking, like in front of
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.360]   six people at church or a class at school.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.120]   So, for example, ninth grade science class, we all had to read a one paragraph.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.560]   You're talking one paragraph description of our project.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.800]   And she, the teacher, was just going down the row.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.120]   We'd walk up to the front, read the paragraph so the class knew what you were working on.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.760]   And as it was coming down my row toward me, I looked down.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.720]   I could see, I could see my heart beating through my shirt here.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.960]   And when it got to the person just behind me as he was going up to speak, I stood up
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.440]   and walked out of the class and went to the bathroom and cried.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.160]   I wasn't going to do it.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.200]   I couldn't do it.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.160]   And I told her afterwards I couldn't do it.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:05.600]   Tenth grade, Mr. Vermillion was my civics teacher, and he announced on the first day
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.960]   of class that there would be an oral book report that everybody had to give.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.160]   And my heart absolutely sank.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.880]   I felt my throat and my shoulders freezing up.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.720]   So I walked up to him afterwards and I said, Mr. Vermillion, I can't do that.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.720]   And he said, well, Johnny, you can't get better than a C in this class if you don't do it.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.920]   And I said, that's fine.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.240]   I'll take a C. And I got a C because I wasn't going to do it.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.120]   I couldn't do it.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.080]   I never ran for any class office, you know, president of the class, vice president, secretary,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.160]   anything like that, because I knew you had to give speeches.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.680]   When I was in the 10th grade, my mother, now this was before any Christian psychology at all.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.040]   We're talking what, 1961 or two.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   She took me to a psychologist because it was so painful and difficult and felt like it was just a
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.160]   pall over everything in my life.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.280]   And the psychologist had me look at these, today I think I'd call them Rorschach charts, and just say what I saw.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.640]   And after an hour of this, I could tell that this psychologist was suggesting my mother was the problem.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.520]   Well, you could believe this is not making me happy because there was one person in the universe under God who
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.760]   understood me, loved me, was patient with me, helped me work through this.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.600]   And it was my mother.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.080]   And there was no way I was going to blame her.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.320]   So we never went back to that.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.960]   So I come to the end of high school, having skipped every possible way of speaking in front of a group and at
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.160]   church and headed off to college with the most dreadful fear and trembling because I knew at Wheaton
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.880]   College, there was a required speech class.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:15.880]   In 1966, between my sophomore and junior year, Evan Welch, the chaplain, came up to me during summer school
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.160]   when I was taking chemistry to catch up with a pre-med plan.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.600]   And I was all excited that maybe God was making clear my life plan to be a medical doctor.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.720]   And I was going to catch up with my science prerequisites and take chemistry.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.000]   And he said, "Would you pray in chapel tomorrow?"
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.920]   And I found myself saying, "How long does it have to be?"
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.960]   Now, there's about 500 people come to summer school chapel, as I recall.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.080]   And he said, "30 seconds, a minute."
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:05.360]   And I do not know how or why it happened, but I said, "Yes."
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.640]   Then I remember walking out on front campus alone and dealing with God.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.080]   I haven't made many vows in my life, but I made one.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:26.800]   And I said this, "Father, if you would just get me through this, just get me through it so that I don't
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:38.760]   freeze and my voice doesn't stop, I will never turn down a speaking opportunity for you again out of fear."
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.960]   That was a really scary vow.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.800]   He did get me through.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:54.080]   I think I've kept the vow and something broke.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.280]   I went to seminary.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.240]   Well, let me give you one more piece at college.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:09.000]   That fall, I got mono and spent three weeks in the infirmary.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.560]   And during those three weeks, I was listening to Harold John Ockengay preach in the chapel a couple hundred yards away.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.640]   And everything in me wanted to handle the Bible like that.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.840]   And after three weeks, I knew I couldn't catch up in organic chemistry.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:37.600]   And God basically said in his way, "I don't want you to do medical anyway.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.120]   You should go to seminary and know my word."
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.720]   That's what I did.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:49.640]   Married Noel, went off to seminary, spent three years loving, studying the Bible, knew that my call was to the word.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.000]   I didn't know what I'd do with it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Didn't know if I could ever preach.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.920]   I won the Clarence Roddy Preaching Award my senior year.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.080]   You can listen to this 18-minute sermon at the Desiree God website.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.080]   I listened to part of it.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.040]   Can't believe it.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.960]   I was 28 years old.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.480]   No, no, 25 years old, I suppose, when I gave it.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:20.200]   And I used "Big Bad John," which was a song popular in those days, to illustrate Ephesians 1.6.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.680]   And I was just amazed.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:32.200]   I was absolutely amazed that I was standing in front of several hundred seminary students and faculty preaching this senior sermon.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.480]   I went off to graduate school because I didn't know what else to do.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.600]   I didn't feel any particular call to any avenue of ministry.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:49.040]   And six years into teaching, which I loved, something rumbled inside me I could not resist.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.360]   I was being pushed by a kind of disillusionment with the romance of academia.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:02.880]   And I was being pulled by every sermon I heard because I said, if it was a good sermon, I'd love to do that.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.840]   And if it was a bad sermon, I'd say, we got to do better than that.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:16.920]   And on October 14, 1979, late at night, writing in my journal, I could resist this desire no longer.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.120]   And I said to Noelle in the morning, what would you think if I resigned my teaching and looked for a church?
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.000]   And she said, I could see that coming.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.040]   And that's what I did for the next 33 years, I preached.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:41.920]   So as I look back over that story that brings me today, it's not the kind of story I would have planned.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   I wouldn't want to live my teenage years over again at all.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.680]   They were not very happy years, at least not at one level.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:58.640]   And as I look back, all I can say is that all the sorrows as well as the happiness, God was making a preacher.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.760]   Not at all the way you would expect him to make a preacher.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.600]   And so for you, the implication is you have no idea.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.240]   You have no idea what he's doing in your life.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.800]   And so trust him and then walk through the open doors where you feel called.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.120]   Amen. That was the audio taken from Lecture #1, The Making of a Preacher.
