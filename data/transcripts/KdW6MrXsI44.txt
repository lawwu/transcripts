[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560]   - We hear from grieving parents a lot,
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.160]   and I suppose that to parent in this broken world
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.480]   is pretty much a guarantee of parental grieving.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.440]   I mean, we are going to grieve to some extent.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.200]   And so what do you do when your children
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.480]   grow up in the church, but then they leave the faith,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.600]   and you're left with the lingering question
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.640]   over how you have failed them?
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.920]   Today's email comes from a father.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.220]   Pastor John, does God promise to save my children?
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.080]   Some teachers say that I need to have faith
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.100]   and that I should claim it and that God would save them.
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.160]   I have four children, all raised in the local church,
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.140]   all walked away from the faith.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.000]   Two seem to be returning,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.380]   but both struggle with sinful lifestyles.
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.040]   The other two are very far from God.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.760]   I'm so depressed over my children's spiritual condition
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.720]   and have asked the Lord to forgive me for being so depressed.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.680]   Do you have any advice for me?
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.120]   So two painful questions.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.820]   Does the Bible promise to save our children?
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.840]   What do I do if I feel like I have failed
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.940]   or I'm just depressed 'cause I don't know?
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.040]   First, does God promise to save my children?
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.200]   That's the way some people construe Proverbs 22.6,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.840]   train up a child in the way he should go,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200]   and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   I doubt that it is an absolute promise that way,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.320]   but a generalization as it stands
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.240]   that we can hope for, pray for, work for.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.280]   In fact, however, there is another vying,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.160]   possible translation of this verse.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.320]   Bring up a child in his own way,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080]   that's the literal translation,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.160]   and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.480]   And his own might be bad,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.760]   which means it's a threat, not a promise.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.620]   Bring up a child in his own way and you're gonna lose him.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.040]   So don't bring him up in his own way,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.680]   bring him up in God's way.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.160]   But in either case,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.760]   I'm not gonna argue for that translation.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.400]   I'm just saying in either case, warning or promise,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.120]   I don't see the nature of Proverbs
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   or the rest of the Bible
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.480]   suggesting that this is an absolute guarantee
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.920]   of believing children to believing and faithful parents.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.800]   And I've got three reasons for that and more,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.360]   but here's three.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.040]   One, in Isaiah 1, 2, God says,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.720]   "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.400]   for the Lord has spoken.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.440]   Children I have reared and brought up,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.700]   but they have rebelled against me."
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.040]   Now, if it were true that good parenting
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.560]   always resulted in faithful children,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.320]   that would be a very strange thing for God Almighty,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.060]   who is the perfect parent, to say.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.900]   That's number one.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.040]   Number two, I'm just reading right now,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.120]   I'm just coming to the end.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.360]   I read this every year as I read through the Bible,
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.040]   I read this long, sorry history of the kings of Israel
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.840]   with bad kings being followed by sons
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.520]   who turn out to be good kings.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.040]   And good kings who are followed by sons
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.840]   who turn out to be bad kings.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.760]   And it is a simply stunning mixture of good and evil
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.520]   and gives me great pause
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.920]   not to make quick and easy assumptions
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.700]   that the bad always produce bad kids
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.520]   and the good always produce good kids.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.920]   It's simply not true.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.440]   It's not so simple, not in the Bible.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.040]   And the third is the most important for me.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.800]   Jesus said about family relations
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.720]   and the effect his gospel has on them, Luke 12 51,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.760]   "Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth?
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.400]   No, I tell you, but division.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.840]   For from now on, in one house,
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.160]   there will be five divided,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.280]   three against two, two against three.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   They will be divided, father against son,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.080]   son against father, mother against daughter,
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.420]   daughter against mother.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.160]   And even more strikingly, Matthew 10 21,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.880]   brother will deliver brother to death,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.120]   father, his child,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.160]   and children will rise up against parents
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.760]   and have them put to death."
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.000]   Now, all in all, as I look at those
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.920]   and lots of other things,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.400]   I don't think the Bible gives any absolute promise
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.600]   to parents that faithful parenting
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.200]   will result in faithful children.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.620]   It's likely to,
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.920]   and we should pray that it will,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.340]   hope that it will,
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.040]   but an absolute promise, I don't think so.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.900]   Which leads now to the last part of the question.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.840]   What am I gonna do with the horrific discouragement?
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.960]   I mean, he's talking about depression here
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.600]   that is undoing him over the unbelief
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.160]   of all four of his children.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.480]   What are we to do?
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.600]   The first thing I would say is that
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.760]   none of us can pass final judgment on our own parenting,
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.560]   and neither can our children.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.760]   Memories, their memories and our memories are fallible.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   Situations were very complex.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.720]   We can know for sure that sins we remember,
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.480]   and there will always be some,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.000]   sins against our children should be confessed to God,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   confessed to them,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.040]   and made right as far as they will allow us
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.740]   to make it right.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.720]   But that is no final judgment about how we did.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.680]   That will only come to light at the last day.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.100]   And that's true for our children and their assessment,
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.840]   as well as our own assessment.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.780]   Which means that the possibilities of peace and joy
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.680]   and hope and love in the present moment cannot,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.120]   must not depend decisively on our assessment
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.720]   of how we did as parents.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.280]   We all sinned.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.720]   We all did less than we could.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.440]   None of us prayed as much as we could.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.920]   None of us fasted as much as we could.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.000]   Did you fast at all?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.720]   None of us humbled ourselves as much as we could.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.880]   None of us were as consistent in our life
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.840]   as we could have been.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.200]   None of us were as faithful to the Word of God
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.160]   as we could have been.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.400]   None of us in exhortation or kindness or meekness
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.200]   or gentleness were as good as we could have been.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.680]   It is hopeless to base our present peace and joy
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.880]   on the assurance that we did a good job as parents,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.000]   that is building a house on sand.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.960]   Our hope in the present moment to survive emotionally
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.520]   and even thrive amid the profound,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.980]   gut-wrenching disappointments of life
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.120]   is the fact that Jesus Christ came into the world
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   to save sinners, to save parents from their sins,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.400]   and to save children from their sins.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.360]   We must build our present lives on the gospel
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.800]   and not on parenting successes
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.480]   and not be undone by parenting failures.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.200]   That's a denial of the gospel.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   The key is to seek, to ask God by the Holy Spirit
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.760]   to give us the faith and the wisdom
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.080]   to weave together three passages of Scripture
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.560]   and walk in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.760]   And here they are, and these seem utterly impossible,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.320]   but hear me out.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.520]   First, he said in Romans 9, 2,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.520]   "I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart,
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.320]   for I could wish that I myself were accursed
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.280]   and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.040]   my kinsmen, according to the flesh."
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.840]   So we do have anguish over those we love
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.280]   who are not believing.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.400]   Second, Paul says in chapter 10, verse 1,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.080]   is that they may be saved."
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.560]   So we do devote ourselves unstintingly,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.520]   morning and night, day after day, to earnest prayer
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.960]   that those we love will be saved.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.220]   And we engage in special seasons of focused prayer.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.160]   We draw friends into that,
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.680]   and we, as led by the Lord, fast for our children.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.220]   And third, we hand over our souls
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.500]   and the souls of our children
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.580]   to the sovereign goodness and wisdom of God
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.260]   and forsake anxiety, according to Philippians 4.7.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.780]   "Do not be anxious about anything,
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.660]   but in everything, by prayer and supplication,
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.740]   with thanksgiving, let your hearts be made known to God,
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.660]   let your requests be made known to God,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.660]   and the peace of God, which passes all under sin,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.840]   understanding, will guard your hearts and minds
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.800]   in Christ Jesus."
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.720]   Now, in the natural human heart,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   this combination of emotions is impossible.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.840]   It certainly seems so to me from time to time.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.360]   Number one, unceasing anguish in your heart
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.820]   because of the lostness of your loved ones.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.400]   Number two, daily, earnest intercession to God
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.240]   on their behalf.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.580]   Number three, peace that passes all understanding
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.220]   because we entrust ourselves and our loved ones to God.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.780]   I suppose that's precisely why Paul calls it
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.780]   peace that surpasses all understanding.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:14.780]   It isn't based on rational deduction.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.940]   The peace of God in these kinds of situations,
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.940]   painful situations, that peace is a miracle.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.280]   It is a gift.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   It cannot be produced by the natural reasoning mind.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.600]   So, may the Lord give us,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.240]   give our friend who wrote this painful note,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   may the Lord give us grace to live in this kind of peace
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.540]   in spite of all our troubles
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.300]   so that our children can see it
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.740]   because that's what they need more than anything.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.660]   - It's heavy stuff.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.860]   Thank you, Pastor John, for addressing it with us.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.140]   I really appreciate you putting the thoughtful time
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.060]   that you do into answers like this one.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.780]   Well, three times per week, we publish
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.300]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds to keep up
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.260]   and you can search our episode archive to look back
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.500]   and you can even reach us by email
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.820]   with a question you may be facing inside the darkness
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.500]   of the pain of parenting in this broken world.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.940]   You can do all that through our online home
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.500]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.180]   Well, speaking of earnest prayers for the souls of the lost,
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.100]   when Jesus talks about fruitfulness,
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.500]   he is not afraid to throw around numbers,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.700]   numbers like 100-fold and 60-fold and 30-fold.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.100]   So, very practically, does this mean that pastoring
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.500]   a small church that's not growing numerically
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.740]   is less fruitful than pastoring a large, growing church?
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.700]   It's a good, honest question from a discouraged pastor
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.780]   and it's on the docket for Wednesday.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.580]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:13.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
