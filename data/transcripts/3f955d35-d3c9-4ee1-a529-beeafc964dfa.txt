[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.160]   in the right direction.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.400]   For episode number 8, I wanted to continue our journey into Marxism.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.200]   I last left off by quoting to you various portions of the 1963 US Communist Party goals.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.760]   That was relevant because you were able to see how Marxism had influenced and fleshed
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.840]   out its principles into explicit goals.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.660]   I'm going to quote to you some of them which were already quoted in the last episode, but
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.200]   just to kind of start us off.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.160]   And I quote, "Get control of the schools.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.320]   Use them as transmission belts for "socialism" and current "communist" propaganda.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.040]   Soften the curriculum.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.800]   Get control of teachers' associations.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.400]   Put the party line in textbooks.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.440]   Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.240]   Discredit the Bible and emphasize a need for intellectual maturity which does not need
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.760]   a religious crutch.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.280]   Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.160]   it violates the principle of separation of church and state.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.880]   Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:12.920]   with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis."
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   At the last episode I left off with two questions.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:29.920]   In the event that you're thinking to yourself that 1963 is somehow outdated, I wanted to
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.300]   quote from the U.S. Communist Party of today, of today.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.900]   This is from their website, quote, "The roots of the Communist Party extend deep
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.320]   into our nation's soil, even far beyond our founding in Chicago in 1919.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.360]   We build on the legacy of those who fought against slavery for the right to organize
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.680]   unions, for civil rights, and for women's vote and reproductive rights.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.760]   We apply the scientific outlook developed by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and others in the
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.120]   context of U.S. history, culture, and traditions.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.160]   The need for the Communist Party is as great as ever.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.640]   Capitalism has cast billions of people around the world into poverty.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.400]   It afflicts humanity with endless wars.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.160]   It institutionalizes racism and women's oppression, denies youth the hope of a future,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.880]   and fuels discrimination against gay, lesbian, and transgender people, religious minorities,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.040]   immigrants, and people with disabilities.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.440]   Capitalism pits worker against worker in a global race to the bottom.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.520]   Corporate interests wage a never-ending campaign to roll back people's hard-won democratic
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.080]   rights.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.660]   Capitalism's insatiable drive for profits has poisoned the earth's land, sea, and air.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.880]   Capitalism treats people and nature as disposable commodities in order to transfer the wealth
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.120]   of the planet to a handful of multi-millionaires.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.400]   Our basic principles are rooted in today's struggles, informed by our history and experience,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.160]   and guided by our scientific outlook and vision of socialism.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.800]   Our bedrock principles include the leading role of the working class in the struggle
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.400]   for social change.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.420]   That working class unity is essential, and the fight against racism and for immigrant
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.340]   rights are essential to build that unity.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.200]   In solidarity with working people around the world, we stand in opposition to U.S. imperialism,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.540]   the system by which U.S. corporations use their economic power, along with the political
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.340]   and military power of our government, to exploit workers, pillage the environment, and corrupt
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:59.660]   governments around the world, just as they do here at home."
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:11.260]   Much of the language that I quoted to you just now, do you see that in politics today?
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:20.260]   Do you see that in politics today?
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:34.260]   And what I quoted to you, an ever-present dialogue in politics today.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:49.100]   Now you can see, by connecting the dots, Marxism is much more present than we have been led
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.500]   to believe.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.740]   It is not benign, it is not even neutral.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:09.140]   This is an all-encompassing worldview that is completely at odds with what most people
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.140]   believe to be good.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:23.020]   It is completely at odds with the worldview of the scriptures.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:31.760]   Socialism and communism share very little differences, if at all, if at all.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:43.040]   It is for that reason, it is for that reason that one of the Communist Party's goals was,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:51.160]   and I quote, "get control of the schools, use them as transmission belts for socialism
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.960]   and current communist propaganda," unquote.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.520]   That's one of the goals.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.560]   And then I quoted to you today's goals.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:16.720]   And in today's goals, that has become the marching beat of what you hear on the news.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:24.640]   And no, Nordic countries like Denmark and Sweden are not socialist countries.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.880]   They are capitalist countries with a high safety net.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.720]   There's a huge difference.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:40.480]   As I make these statements to you, I'm not trying to convince you to become a good Republican.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.560]   That is not my goal here.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:49.080]   As I stated to you earlier in the last episode, the dialectic that is presented, communism
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:58.040]   or socialism versus capitalism, that's the dialectic that is typically pushed on us by
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.760]   the culture.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:07.800]   And because that dialectic is pushed on us by the culture, many well-intentioned yet
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:17.280]   naive Christians believe that entering the discussion is not a prudent thing to do because
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.640]   Christians should not be overly engaged in politics.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:31.880]   But I've embarked in this discussion, not necessarily for politics per se, although
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:40.360]   of course all of life touches some political arena to some degree.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:50.880]   But the reason I embarked on this discussion is because of what the Communist Manifesto
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:09:01.520]   explicitly states with respect to morality, not just mere politics.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:11.120]   When that worldview espouses to destroy, to abolish the nuclear family, to take children
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:21.080]   away for indoctrination, that is far beyond just mere politics.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.720]   Also, I'm just giving you the truth of the matter.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.080]   I am just giving you the truth of the matter.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:41.120]   So as we approach this discussion, do not let the culture's version of what the culture
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:52.940]   wants you to believe the dialectic is to cast the picture of the framework that we should
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.120]   have.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.160]   Let me quote to you again from Karl Marx, from the Communist Manifesto to prove my point.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:10.640]   "Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a socialist tinge.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:17.260]   Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the state?
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:23.420]   Has it not preached in the place of these charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.820]   of the flesh, monastic life and mother church?
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:34.880]   Christian socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heartburnings
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.520]   of the aristocrat."
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:46.840]   Karl Marx makes absolutely no qualms about wanting his ideology to infiltrate and blend
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.080]   it with Christianity.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:55.600]   No doubt, just like as he was stating, by playing on the Christian's desire to be compassionate
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:02.520]   and in most cases, to be intentionally ignorant.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:11.540]   As I alluded to in the last episode, interestingly enough, Karl Marx and C. H. Spurgeon, Charles
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:18.240]   Haddon Spurgeon, the Prince of Preachers, these two figures occupied the same time and
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.000]   the same place.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.520]   They lived during the same time and at the same place.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:33.240]   Did Charles Haddon Spurgeon have anything to say about socialism?
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.840]   Let me read to you a couple quotes by C. H. Spurgeon.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:47.400]   "Did I hear a whisper that ministers are nowadays very broad and have given up the
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.840]   old gospel?
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.360]   I know it and I am not surprised.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.920]   The builders are the first to reject the chosen stone.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.560]   Christ owes little to preachers, and some of his worst enemies are found in their ranks.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.240]   Unconverted men are in too many pulpits and are seeking out many inventions to set aside
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.720]   the pure gospel, which exalts Christ Jesus.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.660]   Let them alone, the ditches gaping for these blind guides.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.400]   Our Lord can do without them.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:21.040]   He owes his victories to himself and to himself alone, and therefore he let the faith of his
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.640]   people rest in peace, for if they will have patience they shall see greater things than
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   they have yet beheld.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.480]   Our text saith that it is not only the Lord's doing and marvelous, but it is marvelous in
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.800]   our eyes, which it could not be if we did not see it.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.080]   We shall see and we shall marvel.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.040]   Some of us may have passed away, but you who are younger may live to see modern thought
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.320]   obtain supremacy over human minds.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:55.800]   German rationalism, which has ripened into socialism, may yet pollute the mass of mankind
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.760]   and lead them to overturn the foundations of society.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.480]   Then advanced principles will hold carnival and free thought will ride with the vice and
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.040]   blood which were years ago the insignia of the age of reason.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.280]   I say that it will be so, but I should not wonder if it come to pass, for deadly principles
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.720]   are abroad and certain ministers are spreading them.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.040]   If it ever should be so, do not, O believers, for a single moment despair, but rest certain
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.080]   that the Lord is about to do a marvelous thing on the earth, and that he will lift up once
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.000]   again the stone which the builders have again refused and cause it to become more than ever
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.160]   the headstone of the corner.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.400]   Never dream of defeat; be calm amid all the din of controversy, for the hand which holds
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.080]   the gospel must win the victory.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.340]   This is the Lord's doing, and we shall see it.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.320]   In the early days of Christianity, multitudes of Christians were tormented to death because
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.120]   of their faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.880]   There was no excuse for it, for they had done no harm to the state.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.280]   Christianity does not come into a nation to break up its arrangements or to break down
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.520]   its fabric.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.260]   All that is good in human society it preserves and establishes.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.500]   It snaps no ties of the family.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.640]   It dislocates no bond of the body politic.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.700]   There are theories of "socialism" and the like which lead to anarchy and riot.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:22.460]   But it is not so with the mild and gentle teaching of Jesus Christ, whose every word
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.260]   is love and patience.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:42.980]   Charles Spurgeon saw beyond the dialectic that socialism/communism was merely political.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.740]   It is not just merely political.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:58.340]   This worldview is antithetical to Christianity.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.620]   I fear, less than any of you, there should be even the least measure of despising the
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.280]   one lost sheep.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.540]   Because of the large and philosophical methods which are now so loudly cried up, I would
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:15.620]   not have you exchange the gold of individual Christianity for the base metal of Christian
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.980]   socialism.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.700]   If the wonders are to be brought in, in vast numbers, as I pray they may be, yet must it
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.540]   be accomplished by the bringing of them in one by one, to attempt national regeneration
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:34.660]   without personal regeneration is to dream of erecting a house without separate bricks.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.940]   In the vain attempt to work in the gross, we may miss the practical result which would
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.000]   have followed working in detail.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.720]   Let us settle it in our minds that we cannot do better than obey the example of our Lord
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:57.040]   Jesus given us in the text and go after the one sheep which has gone astray.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:04.200]   I would not have you exchange the gold of individual Christianity for the base metal
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.600]   of Christian socialism.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:17.560]   "For many a year, by the grand old truths of the gospel, sinners were converted and
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.080]   saints were edified, and the world was made to know that there is a God in Israel.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.040]   But these are too antiquated for the present cultured race of superior beings.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.960]   They are going to regenerate the world by democratic socialism, and set up a kingdom
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.360]   for Christ without the new birth or the pardon of sin.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.080]   Surely the Lord has not taken away the seven thousand that have not bowed the knee to Baal,
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:55.160]   but they are, in most cases, hidden away, even as Obadiah hid the prophets in a cave."
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:00.800]   They are going to regenerate the world by democratic socialism, and set up a kingdom
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.680]   for Christ without the new birth or the pardon of sin.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   C.H.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:18.800]   Spurgeon saw beyond the mere dialectic that is Marxism versus capitalism.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:30.040]   He saw socialism, communism, Marxism for exactly what it was, and he spoke out against it.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.760]   Spurgeon saw that it wasn't just a mere economic philosophy.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:45.160]   Even Karl Marx, even he himself, stated that it wasn't just a mere economic philosophy.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:55.600]   Even he wanted to embed this within Christianity, and he wanted to fool the unsuspecting, or
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.680]   the ones who just don't care.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:07.280]   And out of a very naive desire to do good and to be compassionate, one could easily
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.920]   fall sway to this deceptive philosophy.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.840]   The very fact that I have more quotes by C.H.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:22.680]   Spurgeon that I'm not sharing with you should tell you something.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:30.960]   If this isn't enough for you, take a look back upon history.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.920]   What has been communism's history?
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.560]   What is it?
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:45.280]   Despicable Nazi Germany was responsible for the death of at least six million, probably
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.800]   six to nine million Jews, between 11 to 25 million people total.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:58.120]   And they are rightfully denounced for their despicable and heinous acts.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.720]   But what about communism?
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   What about communism?
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:08.160]   What has been communism's track record in the same plane of thought?
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:17.600]   Well, Kim Il-sung's North Korea resulted in the deaths of 2 million from 1972 to 1994.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.400]   Pol Pot's Cambodia resulted in the deaths of 2 million in the 1970s.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:29.720]   Lenin's Stalin resulted in the deaths of 20 million between the 1920s and the 1950s.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:38.000]   Mao Zedong's China resulted in the deaths of 65 million between 1943 and 1976.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.560]   And I haven't even mentioned Ho Chi Minh or Fidel Castro or anyone from the country of
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.640]   Venezuela.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.680]   Some have it at 100 million total.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:04.760]   100 million total died as a result of Marxism, communism.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.960]   They are AKAs, believe me.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.120]   They are AKAs, as I've just demonstrated.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.000]   If you're ever interested in this subject a little further, I would suggest to you the
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.160]   Black Book of Communism, the Black Book of Communism.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:33.880]   A benign or neutral worldview does not end in the deaths of millions of people.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.760]   It just doesn't.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:46.760]   Now perhaps you're listening to this and you're not a huge fan of C. H. Spurgeon or history.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:52.720]   I'm going to read to you another rather extensive quote, and I'm not going to tell you who said
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   it.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:21:01.960]   But at the end of the long quote, I will tell you who said it.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:09.100]   And internally, judge for yourself whether or not you believe this person before I tell
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.400]   you who said it.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:18.640]   "I elicit your undivided attention as I attempt to discuss with you one of the vital issues
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   of our day.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.360]   It is a rather controversial subject, and yet I think it is the responsibility of the
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.120]   preacher to keep his congregation informed on the major issues of the day, to bring the
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.680]   kind of tenets of our gospel to bear on these various issues.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.000]   Now, this will not be the traditional sermon with a text, and you may feel when it's over
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.200]   that it's more of an academic lecture than a moving sermon, but I think it is important
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.180]   for me to discuss the question of communism with you, and so I am using as a subject from
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.800]   which to preach, "Can a Christian be a communist?"
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.640]   Now, there are at least three reasons why I feel obligated as a Christian minister to
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.360]   talk to you about communism.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.600]   The first grows out of the fact that communism is having widespread influence in the contemporary
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   world.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.560]   Like a mighty tidal wave, it has moved through China, Russia, Eastern Europe, and now has
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.440]   ruled within 90 miles of the borders of our nations.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.160]   More than a billion of the peoples of the world believe in communism, and many of these
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.220]   people have accepted it as a new religion, and they are willing to surrender their total
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.800]   being to this system, a force so potent cannot be ignored.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.280]   A second reason that I feel compelled to talk about communism this morning is that it is
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.040]   the only serious rival of Christianity.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.800]   The other historic and great religions of the world such as Judaism, Muhammadism, Buddhism,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.840]   and Hinduism may stand as alternatives to Christianity, but for the most formidable
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:43.560]   competitor that Christianity faces in the world today, we must look to communism.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.400]   No one conversant with the hard facts of modern life can deny the truth that communism and
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.500]   Christianity's most serious rival.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.880]   The third reason that I feel compelled to talk about communism this morning is that
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.680]   it is unfair and certainly unscientific to condemn a system of thought without knowing
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.120]   what that system of thought says and without knowing why it is wrong and why it is evil.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.480]   So for these reasons, I choose to talk about this troubling issue.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.840]   Now let us begin by answering the question which our sermon topic raises, "Can a Christian
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   be a communist?"
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.200]   I answer that question with an emphatic "no."
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.060]   These two philosophies are diametrically opposed.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.200]   The basic philosophy of Christianity is unalterably opposed to the basic philosophy of communism
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.120]   and all of the dialectics of the logician cannot make them lie down together.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.300]   They are contrary philosophies.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.320]   How then is communism irreconcilable with Christianity?
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.960]   In the first place, it leaves out God and Jesus Christ.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.580]   Communism is avowedly secularistic and materialist.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.040]   The great philosopher of communism, Karl Marx, based his total philosophy on what he called
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.980]   dialectical materialism.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.680]   There was a philosopher by the name of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel who had used what
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.280]   he called a dialectical system to analyze concepts and Karl Marx was willing to take
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.740]   Hegel's dialectic.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.720]   And then he studied another man by the name of Feuerbach, a German philosopher.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.360]   This man was a materialist.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.360]   And so he took the materialism of this man and added it to the dialectic that he got
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.400]   from Hegel and this is why his system is called dialectical materialism.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.840]   Now what is materialism?
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.520]   It says in substance that the whole of reality can be explained in terms of matter and motion.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.880]   In other words, it says that the basic stuff of reality is the material stuff.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.760]   Materialism says, in substance, that idealism is wrong when it talks about the ultimate
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.600]   reality of mind and spirit and all of that.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.960]   Karl Marx was a materialist and he believed that the whole of human history moved on driven
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.640]   by economic forces.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.120]   This was his idea.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.560]   There was no place in that system for God.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.040]   And so from that moment on, communism became an atheistic system.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.440]   And to this very day, it is atheistic.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.360]   It denies the existence of God.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.760]   And if one goes to Russia, even today, he will find many of the churches filled on Sunday
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.760]   morning.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.480]   And he will know that in spite of that, the Russian government has had a campaign against
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.540]   religion and against God and belief in God ever since the revolution in 1917.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.760]   So that no Christian can be a communist because communism leaves out God.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.760]   It regards religion psychologically as wishful thinking, regards religion intellectually
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.600]   as a product of fear and ignorance, and it regards religion historically as an instrument
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.720]   serving the ends of exploiters.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.240]   This is what communism teaches about religion.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.080]   And so in a real sense, we disagree with this because we believe that history is moved not
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.240]   by economic forces, but by spiritual forces.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.920]   We believe that there is a God in this universe, a God who loves his children and a God who
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.680]   works through history for the salvation of man.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.040]   Consequently, we can't accept communism at that point.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.840]   A second reason that we can't accept communism is that its methods are opposed to Christianity.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.800]   Since for the communists, there is no divine government or no absolute moral order.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.280]   There are no fixed immutable principles.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.920]   So force, violence, murder, and lying are all justifiable means to bring about the millennial
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   end.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.200]   Lenin, the man who was something of the technician of communism, putting the philosophy of Karl
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:14.560]   Marx into practical action, said on one occasion, "We must be ready to employ trickery, deceit,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.120]   and lawbreaking, withholding and concealing truth."
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.400]   That the followers of Lenin have been willing to act upon these instructions is a matter
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.840]   of history.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.440]   For communism, the end justifies the means.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.680]   There again, we can't go along with this.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.400]   We believe that there are certain moral principles in this universe that are eternal and absolute.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.680]   We believe that there are some things right and there are some things wrong.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.800]   It's wrong to lie.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.240]   It's always been wrong to lie and will always be wrong.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.600]   It's wrong to hate.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.080]   It has always been wrong and will always be wrong.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.320]   It's wrong to throw away the precious lives that God gives us in righteous living.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.480]   It was wrong in 1800 BC and it's wrong in 1962 AD.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   It's wrong in Russia.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   It's wrong in China.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.480]   It's wrong in India.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   It's wrong in New York.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.840]   It's wrong in Atlanta.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.400]   We believe that there are some things right, eternally and absolutely so, and there are
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.880]   some things wrong.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.000]   Then, we don't believe that the end justifies the means if those means happen to be bad.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.280]   For we know that the end represents the means in process and the ideal in the making.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:24.000]   The end is preexistent in the means, and so destructive means cannot bring about constructive
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.360]   ends.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.200]   Immoral methods cannot achieve moral goals.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.440]   And so, we disagree with the ethical relativism of communism.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.920]   In the third place, we have to disagree with communism because the end of communism is
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   the state.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.400]   I should qualify this by saying that the state in communist theory is a temporary reality,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.840]   an interim reality, which is to be eliminated when the classless society emerges.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.080]   Karl Marx talks of that day when there will be a classless society.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.640]   The ruling class, or rather the workers, what he called the proletariat, will through the
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.680]   revolution take power from the ruling class, which were the producers or the capitalists.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.120]   And finally, they will come to power and through their power, they will establish a classless
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.480]   society.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.880]   He says that while you are on the way to this classless society, that the state is the end.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.760]   Man becomes only a means to that end.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:24.680]   And if any man's so-called rights or liberties stand in the way of that end, they are simply
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.720]   swept aside.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.240]   And so in the communistic system, you do not have freedom of the press.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.280]   You do not have freedom of speech.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.000]   You do not have freedom of assembly.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   All these things are under the scrutiny of the state, which is manipulated through the
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.040]   party.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   And whatever the party says, that must be done.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.000]   All the freedoms that are dear to us are denied.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.200]   Man has to be a servant, a dutiful and submissive servant of the state.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.760]   The state is omnipotent and supreme, and so if one lived in Russia today, he couldn't
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.180]   just get up and make a speech against the communist party.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.120]   If one lived in Russia today, he could not write a book saying certain things without
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   the condemnation of the party.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.640]   He may be searched and even killed.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   You remember the great book that Pasternak wrote, and you remember the problems that
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.560]   he faced because there were within that book some things that they didn't like in Russia.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:24.980]   It had criticisms of the system."
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:36.380]   If you are not convinced by what C. H. Spurgeon said, if you are not convinced of communism's
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:48.240]   objective historical record, will you perhaps be convinced from a sermon from Dr. Martin
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.940]   Luther King, Jr.?
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.020]   That was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:11.000]   Now, let me say, theologically, I don't agree with many points of Dr. King's.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.280]   My point in quoting him was this.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:32.440]   There have been many people across the spectrum that have accurately diagnosed and explicitly
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:49.160]   called out Marxism, Socialism, Communism for exactly what it is, and they are all the same.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:31:00.320]   I'm going to say it again, the dialectic that's pushed, that it's Marxism versus capitalism,
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:12.240]   and therefore, we need not care as Christians, we need not care, that is completely false.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:32.400]   Marx himself wanted to push that dialectic so that well-intentioned Christians would
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   be fooled.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.400]   We need to be sober.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   We need to be discerning.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:48.140]   I want to read to you 1 John 4, verses 1-6, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:56.920]   test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.900]   out into the world.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.640]   By this you know the Spirit of God.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.840]   Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:13.240]   spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:19.780]   This is the spirit of the Antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.080]   it is already in the world.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.640]   You are from God, little children, and have overcome them, because greater is He who is
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.320]   in you than he who is in the world.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.480]   They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.560]   them.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.040]   We are from God.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.000]   He who knows God listens to us.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.200]   He who is not from God does not listen to us.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:52.600]   By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:33:00.760]   Test every spirit to see whether they are from God."
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:09.480]   Colossians 2 says something similar, "We are not to be beholden by deceptive philosophies,
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.720]   the elementary principles of this world."
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:25.600]   And let me tell you, communism, socialism, Marxism, does not confess that Jesus is God.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.160]   In fact, it does the exact opposite.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:44.720]   It is antagonistic to the Christian worldview, which is why they want to abolish the family,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:56.080]   abolish organized religion, and embed themselves and masquerade around as some form of Christianity.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.360]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.760]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:34.240]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Harno.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:41.720]   Amen.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.300]   (upbeat music)
