[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.780]   You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.320]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.480]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.000]   about search engine optimization, or SEO.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.960]   Now, dangerous question.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.400]   What was the last thing you searched for on Google?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.980]   Mine was, and I'm gonna look at my phone here,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.880]   can dogs eat grapes?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.760]   The answer is no, you should not let your dog eat grapes.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.780]   They're part of the nightshade family,
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.120]   very poisonous for pups.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, that answer came from a website,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.320]   and that top result in Google means that page
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.080]   will likely get the most visits,
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.520]   possibly converting that visit into a sale.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.960]   So SEO is the practice of optimizing your webpage
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.660]   so that it is more easily discoverable
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.760]   by search engines like Google or Bing,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   and your goal is to rank at the top.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.540]   Simply put, it doesn't matter how beautiful your website is
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.920]   if nobody can find it, right?
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.420]   So how does SEO work?
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.140]   Imagine you're walking into a library
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.320]   with a specific book in mind.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.840]   You notice right away that all the books sit on shelves
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.440]   that are neatly organized into rows.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.200]   Above each row are signage that cleanly label
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.880]   different genres categorized by age group.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.280]   Each book has a visible title,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.800]   and in the cover is a short description
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.300]   that gives you a clear idea of what the book is about.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.280]   Now, in this analogy, the well-organized library
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.120]   is your website, and you play the role of the search engine.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.380]   The organized rows represents your site structure,
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.080]   and the hanging signage represents
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.360]   a website's navigation menu and categories.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.240]   The book's stocked shelves represents
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.040]   your website's content, and the words that make up
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.440]   the title of the book you're looking for,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.200]   those are the keywords.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.320]   So if I'm looking for a book
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.280]   that's about safe diet for dogs,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.120]   I'm going to zero in on the book title
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.880]   that most closely represents that.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.320]   Now, the full book title itself and a description
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.640]   represents your page's title tags and meta descriptions.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.360]   The more optimized all of this is,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.800]   the easier it is for a search engine to find you,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.320]   deem you relevant, establish you as an authority,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.160]   and that pushes you up into search rankings
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.480]   so someone can find you on organic search.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.160]   So it's safe to say that search engine optimization,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.000]   in my opinion, is one of the most important functions
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.340]   of marketing.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.800]   It also happens to be a job function
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.280]   that is always high in demand,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.440]   as the ROI can be high when done correctly.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.040]   So today, we'll be joined by Mike Shaw.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520]   He's an SEO manager at Lego Education.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.240]   He also comes with years of experience
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.920]   on the agency side of the business,
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.440]   so he has a very broad and deep perspective
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.360]   into the business of SEO.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   In this video, he's going to cover topics
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   such as how search engine optimization works,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.320]   how to get your keywords onto page one,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.680]   and where do companies typically struggle
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.080]   when it comes to SEO?
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.320]   All right, let's get started.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.140]   - Hey, guys.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.440]   Today, we're talking about
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.240]   how to be a search engine marketer.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.440]   Joining us is Mike Shaw.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.000]   Mike, how you doing?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.120]   - Good, how are you, Tim?
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.960]   - Good.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.720]   Mike, I may be biased.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.040]   No, that's not true, right?
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.080]   I'm absolutely biased.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.200]   But SEO, especially for digital marketers,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.700]   is probably one of the most important disciplines today.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.440]   Like, it doesn't matter how wonderful
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.840]   or beautiful your website is,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.640]   if no one can find it, right?
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.680]   So can you tell us a little bit
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.880]   about what you're doing today
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.040]   and how long you've been doing it?
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.120]   - For sure.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.680]   So I've been doing SEO for about eight to nine years now.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   Kind of hard to keep track.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.080]   Started back in 2014.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.940]   Worked at agencies pretty much across the country.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.660]   And today, I'm working for a fully remote agency
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.020]   that's out of Irvine, California.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.840]   And they focus mostly on B2B SaaS.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.320]   That's kind of their niche.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.800]   So I'm working with a bunch of different clients
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.880]   that are into mobile DevOps.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.200]   Some of it is freight and logistics transportation.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.560]   Just across the gambit,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.080]   and I've done even more than that into e-commerce.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.480]   And finance and everything like that in the past.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.160]   So yeah, that's kind of in a nutshell,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.200]   the verticals I'm working in,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.600]   where I'm working at now.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.100]   Outside of that, just in the day-to-day,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.760]   trying to get things done.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.600]   - That's obvious.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.880]   So let's just set some kind of foundational work
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.800]   for our viewers.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.680]   Can you just tell us from your point of view,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.800]   what is SEO and why should it
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.780]   and why does it matter for businesses?
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   So I like to,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.100]   SEO is constantly changing over time.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.040]   So I feel like as more things get added in,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.160]   the definition gets more and more vague.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.240]   So I was trying to think of a good one
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.120]   before we got on here.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.560]   And I kind of came up with,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040]   it's the art and science of helping websites
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.800]   improve their visibility in online spaces
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   that are accessed through in-brand keyword searches.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.520]   If that makes sense.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.560]   - That's actually really solid.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.440]   That's good.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.280]   Tell us about that.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.840]   - Yeah, I agonized over that one.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.760]   So essentially just encompasses
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.160]   pretty much the entire concept of,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.700]   we're trying to get these websites seen by more people
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.100]   in areas that people are already looking for them in,
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.580]   but they might not necessarily be there.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.620]   So one good thing,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.420]   and this is a skill that you'll wanna think about too,
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.460]   if you wanna get into the career,
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.660]   is think about how you'd explain it
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.300]   to your aunt at a Christmas party,
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.840]   which is obviously a real thing
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.100]   that I've had to do multiple times,
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.100]   probably with the same aunt.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.940]   So if you wanna break it down into more simple terms,
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.860]   most people understand what Google is.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.820]   Google has 86% of the market share.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.100]   So it's not too far off to say,
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.180]   this is what we do anyways.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.760]   We work mostly in Google,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.280]   but we're saying, okay,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   you search for something on the first page of Google
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.600]   and you don't see it.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.800]   Are you gonna go to the second page
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.360]   or are you gonna search again?
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.460]   Everyone searches again.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.780]   No one goes to the second page.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.200]   So there you're demonstrating the value of,
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.180]   we want people to be on the first page.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.560]   You wanna help websites get there
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.440]   'cause if they're not there,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.140]   they might be down in the other eight pages
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.920]   where they're not getting any visibility.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.400]   There's just no value there.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.620]   So through us helping them improve the quality
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.740]   and optimization of their site
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.920]   through a bunch of different levers,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.080]   you can help them raise their rank and get to that point.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.660]   And that is essentially what we're trying to do through SEO.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.280]   - That's an awesome description.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.480]   I've had conversations with probably the same man.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.760]   So we need to have another conversation with her together,
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   team up on this one.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.680]   I love how you talk about being art and science.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.840]   That's absolutely true.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.960]   So let's maybe focus on maybe the objective piece first.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.680]   It's like, there's like the discipline
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.360]   if you wanna get really tech, like technical,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.320]   like there's on-page, there's off-page
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.860]   and there's technical SEO.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.240]   Can you maybe break it down for us?
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.360]   Like when you're looking at an SEO strategy
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.440]   that's all encompassing, like what do you need to do?
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.840]   - For sure.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.960]   So, I mean, I think, you know, when you're starting off
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.360]   and even now I really do like to break things out
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.680]   into pillars like that technical on-page and off-page
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.360]   where, you know, you think of technical,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.880]   like your site and your content has to be accessible.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   The search engine has to be able to see it
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.160]   in order to get into the search results in the first place.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.680]   So if you don't have that, the other two don't matter.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.980]   And then after that, it's like, okay,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.900]   they can see your site and you go to on-page.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.940]   That's about what's the content in your site.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.540]   Does it say the right things that are related
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.860]   to the keywords that you wanna be showing up for?
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.940]   If you don't have that, how are you gonna rank
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.500]   for those keywords you wanna see?
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.460]   And lastly, authority is more of, you know,
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.720]   proprietary search engine Google type thing
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.180]   where we're saying, you know,
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.020]   how much authority do other sites give this site?
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.020]   And that's essentially external linking.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.780]   You know, do other sites link to you?
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.880]   Google uses that kind of as like an unofficial voting method
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.320]   say like, all right, you know, these two sites,
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.600]   really good technical, pretty much the same content.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.960]   One of them has 50,000 linking root domains.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.600]   The other one has two, 50,000 linking root domains.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.360]   Everyone is saying this is more authoritative.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.380]   We like this best.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.080]   It helps their robot decide what's the better result
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.080]   when it can't do it on its own.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.000]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.680]   I remember like when you're looking
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.960]   at your back linking strategy,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.400]   when someone who may be uninformed,
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.640]   they're like, hey, increase our off pay strategy.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.540]   And it lists all these websites that link to it.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.600]   It's like, look, they're not gonna link to us
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.160]   if our content doesn't read right,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.320]   or if it doesn't have authority,
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.500]   or we don't sound credible.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.900]   And so a lot of it has to do with coaching
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   our content creators on writing something that's memorable,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.940]   that's meaningful and actionable to our viewers.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.980]   A lot of times I feel like they do
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.240]   the most convenient, right?
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.060]   They just kind of write something out there,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.300]   maybe it's 500 words, if at all,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.780]   and they just hope it sticks.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.140]   And just no one's gonna link to that.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.740]   I like your analogy where if you're trying
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.840]   to explain to somebody, and if you're trying
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   to refer them to a credible source of article,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.680]   like you would want to send them somewhere that's meaty,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.040]   right, that they're actually gonna learn something.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.160]   If it's just high level, like no one's gonna read that.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.000]   And for the same reason,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.240]   like no one's gonna want to back link to you.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.700]   So I love that description.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.440]   Can you tell us a little bit about the on-page keyword
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.120]   kind of strategy piece of it, right?
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.720]   'Cause there's like, how do you go around
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.080]   identifying the keywords?
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.320]   How do you prioritize them?
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.980]   And then what does it take to even move up a page
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.500]   when it comes to on-page optimization?
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.340]   - For sure.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.860]   And I think, especially if we're gonna go back
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.500]   to the real basics here, we can step back
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.340]   and talk really briefly about how do search engines work?
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.220]   How do they understand there's differences
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.460]   in keywords and stuff like that?
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.520]   So essentially, to get through quickly,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.580]   say there's a little robot that comes
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.500]   from the search engine, they call them Spiders,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.220]   and they will crawl all the websites
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.780]   that they can discover through the internet,
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.600]   whether it's links or other ways like that.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.440]   And they index the content and basically say like,
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.120]   all right, as far as we can understand it
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.520]   from AI or machine learning,
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.360]   this is what this content is about.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.280]   They kind of assign it to a general bucket.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.340]   And within those, there's just more and more buckets
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.320]   that are kind of different topics and keyword related.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.520]   So then when you're thinking about keywords for your site,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.640]   you wanna say like, all right, what is my offering?
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.700]   What am I trying to do here?
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.720]   What do I want people discovering me for?
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.520]   And then you have to look and understand through,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.820]   there's a couple different metrics here.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.580]   Like one is search volume, where you can see
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.020]   how many times a month on average
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.620]   does this term get searched?
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.580]   And you say, all right, this one has high search volume,
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.980]   a lot of people are looking for it,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.700]   and it's really relevant to my product.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.700]   And that's kind of how you get to like, all right,
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.100]   this is a particular keyword that I wanna have ranking
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.600]   for on my site, and so on and so forth.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.620]   You're obviously gonna have more than one keyword
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.460]   ranking for your site,
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.780]   but that's kind of the general concept around it.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.860]   In terms of actually getting yourself to rank
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.580]   for that keyword, that's kind of where
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.600]   the art and science of SEO comes in.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.920]   It's about having specific areas on your site,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.960]   there's things like title tags, headers,
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.520]   different areas where search engines are predisposed
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.340]   to look for instances of keywords to get a quick like,
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.800]   all right, this is what this is about,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.480]   and then I'll evaluate the content to see if it's any good.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.540]   And then it's also to your point talking about,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.160]   you want something meaty,
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.000]   it's not just about earning a link like that,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.520]   the search engine algorithm is able to understand
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.840]   if you're covering a topic completely.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   Google doesn't wanna show bad results
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.900]   in the higher positions, they want someone to come in
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.880]   and say like, all right, this page completely satisfied
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.240]   the intent of this query, I don't need to go back out
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.620]   and look for a different result.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.200]   That's kind of how they maintain their market share
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.560]   by having really high quality results versus being like,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.800]   why do I never find what I want on the first page?
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.120]   Which no one ever says 'cause Google's pretty good at it.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.720]   - Yeah, and even adding to that,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   I think for the part of the science is like you mentioned,
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.080]   looking at average monthly searches, right?
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.620]   Broadly across the whole internet,
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.240]   you're also looking at competitive score, right?
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.640]   And having good mix of things that aren't super competitive,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.060]   but have high volume is a kind of a sweet spot to be, right?
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.420]   How do you do that?
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.440]   So let's say you have a keyword,
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.380]   let's say it's 9,000 search volume and above,
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.320]   and let's say SEMrush says the difficulty score is,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.240]   let's say 85, right?
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.460]   And let's say within that keyword group,
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.640]   let's say there's 10 keywords
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.480]   that are kind of very closely related
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.160]   of varying degrees of competition.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.600]   So how do you go about cracking that nut for a high volume,
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.820]   relatively high competitive score keyword?
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.000]   - Well, it depends a lot like that KD,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.960]   like the keyword difficulty that metric in SEMrush
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   pretty much tells you, you know,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.360]   there's really big players, the high authority players here.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.480]   So if you could take that back roughly to say like,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.920]   these people have a lot of links
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.440]   and if you don't have a lot of links,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.520]   it's gonna be a lot more difficult for you
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.440]   to score in that keyword.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.760]   So it kind of depends on the site that you're coming in on.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.920]   Like I've had clients where I've come in
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.960]   and they have this huge backlinking portfolio,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.280]   they've been around since like 2002.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.800]   And it's like, we can pretty much rank
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.640]   for whatever we want.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.880]   The keyword difficulty really doesn't apply to us
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.960]   because we have the authority to back it up
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.980]   versus other sites if you're just starting out
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.400]   and you're saying like, I wanna go after
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.040]   like mesothelioma claims, which is, you know,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.880]   unrelated like the most expensive keyword
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.400]   you could bid on a paid search.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.800]   But that's gonna be like, you know,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.960]   everyone wants that keyword.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.560]   There's gonna be a ton of sites going after it
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.780]   and it's gonna be like,
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.040]   we might have to back into that in a different way.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.480]   And that's gonna be about like, all right,
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.840]   how many of those subtopics like you just talked about
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.280]   do we have that maybe have a lower keyword difficulty
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.520]   that we can try to get in on there?
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.840]   So you're starting to look from short tail,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.720]   which is gonna be like, again,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.000]   I'll do a different example 'cause this is better, shoes.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.840]   Like, you know, that has huge search volume.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.880]   There's really generic.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.520]   It could mean a ton of different things,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.520]   but then you can get down to like the really nitty gritty
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.400]   stuff like size nine trail running shoes for women
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.240]   with thin sold feet.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.160]   Like the search volume is really low,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.360]   but the difficulty goes down
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.380]   'cause there's much fewer results
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.760]   that are talking about that.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.800]   So you try to build up your relevancy on the long tail,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.640]   what's most applicable to your product.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.400]   And then you kind of build up to getting
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.200]   to that more short tail keyword through site hierarchy.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.280]   So say we're talking about shoes again.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.160]   So we wanna say, let's build a page that's just shoes.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.600]   And it's like, here's all the shoes
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.200]   that we have in categories.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.440]   We have men's shoes, women's shoes, running shoes,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.080]   hiking shoes, trail running shoes.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.680]   And we're linking out from these things to different pages
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.640]   that are all about these different things.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.040]   So like what I said before,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.640]   Google wants a result that satisfies
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.560]   the entire intent of the query of say, shoes.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.960]   How do we satisfy the entire intent of shoes?
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.280]   We literally have a page that says,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.380]   here's every single shoe in every category that we have.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.360]   We link down to it and their whole site hierarchy
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.200]   just keeps going down.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.140]   We have more information, more products.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.660]   We get down to even the most nitty gritty,
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.940]   like what I've made a ridiculous thin sold example.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.420]   That is kind of how you build up to it.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.520]   You start with the easier, not so difficult keywords,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.260]   make the site structure right, build out the right content
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.140]   and just keep building those pages out.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.880]   And that's how you're gonna get to that point.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.320]   Obviously it takes a long time.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.820]   You have to build authority while you do that,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.580]   which can obviously happen naturally.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.700]   And there's other things that you can do
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.120]   to try to influence that.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.100]   But that is the general sense,
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.380]   if you're coming from kind of a net new site
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.340]   and you want it to build up to play with the big dog,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.620]   so to speak.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.020]   - Yeah, that's really helpful.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.900]   One thing that I do, and I'm kind of curious
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.820]   if you have your own version of this,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.100]   'cause everyone does it a little differently,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.660]   is when I'm building my keyword strategy,
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.180]   and of course you build that through input
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.500]   from many internal stakeholders, right?
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.700]   So I'm talking to your product, I'm talking to your comms,
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.500]   I'm talking to support and sales,
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.900]   kind of doing a conglomeration of all the relevant keywords.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.060]   I usually group them into protect, grow, and expand, right?
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.180]   So protect are ones that we should absolutely
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.180]   be on page one for,
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.180]   and if we're not, what's the plan to get there?
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.920]   Expand are your very relevant keywords
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.420]   that may be a longer tail,
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.800]   or maybe difficulties like maybe 60 and below, right?
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.040]   And then expand is purely competitors are there,
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.640]   you're not in there at all.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.360]   It's probably gonna take some kind of investment
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.640]   to break into that.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.800]   Or you're maybe identifying a trend
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.980]   that may be two years out from now,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.760]   and you wanna start now and start building and owning that.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.240]   So I typically look at it that lens.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.520]   Is that kind of similar to how you kind of go about
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.300]   kind of advising like a keyword strategy,
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.640]   or is there another way that you look at it?
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.680]   - Not that it's not a valid way of looking at it.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.520]   You know, it's definitely,
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.000]   if you're taking that difficulty into mind,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   it's really good in a sense that you're like prioritizing
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   for what can we win on immediately
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.740]   and what can we plan out for,
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.280]   which, you know, a lot of stakeholders,
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.760]   if you're internal or clients,
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.620]   if you're working at an agency really like.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.680]   For me, I don't do it so much as that.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.320]   I really just don't take keyword difficulty into effect,
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   maybe to my detriment, honestly.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.020]   But I look at it more as like,
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.840]   I like to just map out the entire site.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.280]   I take like an Excel sheet and it has like row one,
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.560]   basically representing click levels down to four.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.280]   So like homepage, solutions page, sub page.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.120]   So you know what I mean?
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.920]   Like that URL title tag,
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.000]   and then I do up to three keywords for each
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.160]   that either they are kind of ranking for,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.080]   or I find a competitor that's doing that page
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.160]   better than them and assign that keyword.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.640]   And that's kind of how I get to that, you know,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.240]   I think maybe protect grow,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.800]   saying this is kind of what we have,
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.280]   this is what we want to grow into.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.620]   And then for expansions, it's about competitive gap for me.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.720]   I go in, you know, look at other sites like, okay,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.040]   what do we just don't have that they have?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.460]   And then I build a content strategy around that
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.360]   mostly is what I do.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.120]   So I guess I kind of do something similar.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.200]   It's just mine are just more grouped into, you know,
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.000]   what are the different sections of the site
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and whether it's protect, grow or expand
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.020]   is just, you know, kind of irrelevant
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.240]   as long as the tactic I'm doing to get there,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.320]   you know, is in place.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.160]   That makes sense.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:15.980]   - Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.320]   And actually, I like how you're thinking
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.280]   in terms of site structure and hierarchy,
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.360]   'cause to your earlier point,
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.920]   that's how Google is gonna look at as well, right?
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.840]   Like is the structure of a site relevant as a whole,
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.880]   and that kind of all kind of,
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.960]   they all add together in some to like your authority
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.100]   as a site.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.880]   How, when you're looking at,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.200]   let's say optimizing a product page for keyword
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.840]   versus let's say pairing in blogs to supplement that,
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.040]   what's the relationship between those types or even beyond?
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.160]   Like if you're trying to grow a keyword category,
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.780]   like where is like, where should a product page play
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.000]   versus where should a product
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.840]   or even like a glossary page or like a SERP?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.080]   Like what are your thoughts on that?
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.960]   - So that's a big thing that I like to call
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.280]   commercial versus editorial keywords.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.000]   I think it's a direction we can take that
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.680]   where we're saying there are keywords that trigger SERPs,
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.280]   search engine results pages,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.840]   that have results that are articles, blogs, news,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.760]   whatever you wanna call it.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.800]   We call that editorial, it's more long form,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.840]   it's kind of informative type content.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.660]   And then commercial terms are the ones
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.280]   that trigger product category homepages,
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.080]   pages you're gonna wanna convert on.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.000]   And you'll often find that with product pages,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.920]   it's like, I'll just stick with shoes 'cause it's easy,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.800]   like Nike Metcon 2,
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.920]   that's gonna be probably a product page,
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.520]   if not a category page or like by Nike Metcon 2.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.440]   Or if you're talking about like,
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.960]   SaaS or something like that,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.240]   it's usually like mobile DevOps solutions,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.700]   mobile DevOps software.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.040]   Whereas if you would just put in mobile DevOps
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.180]   or CICD, whatever it might be,
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.060]   you're probably gonna get a more informative page.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.440]   So it's about looking at what kind of SERPs
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.840]   are being triggered by those keywords
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.880]   and then you can kind of get an understanding of like,
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.760]   all right, for this,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.440]   I'm gonna need to write an article for it
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.520]   'cause I'm not gonna write for it on a product page
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.680]   or something to that effect.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.040]   Or you could take,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.080]   there's plenty of experimental approaches
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   where you can do a quasi editorial product page
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.960]   where it's traditional kind of like e-commerce,
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   picture, price, whatever it might be
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.080]   or whatever that is.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   And then underneath you have a lot more content
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.240]   that's maybe like an FAQ format,
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.720]   it's tabbed or something like that,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.840]   where you're saying like,
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.760]   here's why I'm selling this
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.640]   and here's everything you need to know about it on one page.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.120]   So it's really about understanding what type of SERP,
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.360]   how does Google understand this
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.080]   as transactional or informational
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.640]   and then making the appropriate piece of content
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.280]   to meet that.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.440]   - That's awesome.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.960]   And kind of building upon that
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.720]   and maybe even bringing in a topic
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.960]   you touched on earlier briefly is just,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.360]   how do you measure efficacy of your SEO program, right?
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.760]   So like you mentioned earlier,
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.240]   you mentioned like there's elements of it
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.800]   like search keyword volume and your position,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.640]   your rank on page one.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.720]   I think those are the obvious ones,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.680]   but like when you're building a dashboard,
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.160]   whether it's for an executive audience
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.920]   or maybe for a decision-making peer or a content creator,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.720]   like what kind of dashboards and information
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.440]   or data do you put together that helps tell the story
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.800]   to compel like your desired action from them?
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.160]   - For sure.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.320]   So, I mean, there's different levels.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.880]   You can go pretty basic,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.040]   which is like the every man's SEO metrics,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.520]   which are gonna be like keyword rankings and traffic.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.480]   Like period over period, did we improve rank
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.120]   and did we get more traffic?
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.960]   Like, all right, good.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.400]   That's good in one sense,
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   but what does that really tell me
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.120]   about like the health of my business?
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   So then you gotta think like, all right,
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.040]   what's the next level?
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.920]   And that's gonna be conversions.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.120]   Or if you're in e-commerce, we have revenue metrics,
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.720]   you know, getting into GA here.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   You can say like, all right,
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.240]   period over period for these new pages we created
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.000]   or pages that we added new content to
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.560]   or made some change to,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.280]   this is how many more conversions we got
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.460]   through the organic channel specifically.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.680]   And that kind of helps say like,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.320]   look at this is actual business values
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.800]   for customers coming in.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.240]   That's what we're looking at there.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.920]   And then there's even like, you know,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.840]   the really go big level where you're talking
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.520]   like almost a rev ops where you're like
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.540]   actually attributing pipeline revenue
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.400]   to what you're doing on the site.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.640]   And that gets into like, you know,
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.840]   lifetime value, customer acquisition costs,
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.120]   where you're legitimately like making a ratio
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.760]   to prove out for every dollar that you're paying me,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.560]   this is how many dollars I'm making you back
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.720]   through SEO efforts.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.240]   And that's where you really get into like,
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.640]   you know, the advanced stuff.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.320]   And I think that's ultimately where everyone should end up,
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.080]   but you know, getting there is, like I said,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.640]   pipeline revenue, rev ops,
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.040]   that kind of stuff gets really complicated.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.480]   Even conversions sometimes can be complicated.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.880]   If you know, a client or a site,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.160]   you'd be surprised like big names don't have them set up.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.800]   Or they say like, well, we don't have attribution
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.360]   and Salesforce or something to that effect.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.120]   So, you know, it can be hairy.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.760]   So I always start from the basics,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.880]   make sure I have those covered,
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.120]   but try to understand whoever the stakeholder
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   is in your company or whoever the client is,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.320]   what they really wanna see.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.380]   I always say like, what's gonna make you happy
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.220]   at the end of the day?
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.640]   What's gonna be your measure for success?
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.280]   Just emphasize that as much as possible.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.120]   But I think it's always good
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.720]   to tell that other story underneath as well.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.540]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.120]   So for the Holy Grail situation,
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.480]   where you're able to tie like organic activity
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.160]   to revenue or pipeline influence or whatever it is,
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.480]   are you able to do that down to the keyword
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.800]   or are you just looking as a program?
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.600]   Like my organic program in total,
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.360]   you've spent 80K and this is what it gets you.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.960]   Like, or is it more granular than that?
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.560]   - No, it's pretty much, I think at the overall level,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.600]   at that point you're just trying to say like,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.000]   dollar spent in the program,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.240]   this is the output you're getting from that,
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.340]   just almost like an ROI type thing.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.880]   When you're getting down to keyword stuff,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.600]   that's kind of the difference between us
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.400]   and someone like paid search.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.440]   If you look through the evolution of SEO,
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.120]   there was a lot of issues with keyword spam,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.460]   keyword stuffing and Google's solution for that
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.400]   was to really just cut off keyword level data altogether,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.500]   not tell you kind of what you're getting
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.340]   at the keyword level
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.440]   'cause it was just apparently causing issues.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.620]   So you really have a hard time doing that.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.440]   You can do some of it through Google Search Console,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.040]   but still that data is sampled.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.540]   So I always tell people to take that
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.040]   with a grain of salt for sure.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.400]   - In your opinion, where do companies usually fall short
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.480]   when it comes to SEO?
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.980]   Whether it's not including the best practices,
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.740]   not having rigor or program, or it could be workflow.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.560]   Because you work with so many clients,
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.060]   what are the general challenges you see out there?
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.680]   - It varies a lot, but I think that a lot of it
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.080]   comes down to like sloppiness,
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   just kind of not keeping up with some of the technical
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.280]   and content quality tasks that you should be.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.920]   You always find a bunch of like duplicative pages,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.240]   things that were indexed from an event they did,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.920]   however, six, two years ago,
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.840]   and there's like a million of those.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.520]   It's just a lot of loose ends to clean up
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.540]   that can overall, if your site has all these pages
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.840]   that are dead ending, they're broken links,
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.220]   they're from really old dates,
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.440]   say like you haven't cleaned up your blog content
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.160]   in the last 10 years,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.000]   but the majority of your content is from four years ago.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.580]   The search engine is gonna look at your site
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.480]   and be like, all right, this is irrelevant stuff.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.920]   These people obviously aren't on top of their game.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.160]   We're gonna demote you.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.000]   That kind of content or like sloppy mess
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.160]   or whatever you wanna call it,
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.080]   can actually bring down the quote unquote
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.760]   quality score of your site.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.860]   And that's gonna hurt you overall,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.080]   even if you have a really nice optimized core section,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.880]   all that fat's gonna drag you down.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.920]   That's one big thing that encompasses
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   a lot of different tactics and strategies
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.200]   that I think sites don't always do well.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.440]   - Yeah, I like that 'cause whenever you do
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.240]   any kind of new SEO engagement,
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.140]   the question is always like,
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.920]   what's the lowest hanging fruit?
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.520]   And people think I need to start writing all this copy,
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.840]   whereas it's like, really, it's like actually,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.600]   there's some foundational stuff that you did.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.320]   That's the most, the lowest hanging fruit.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.680]   And I like your dead end pages as one example, right?
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.000]   And just removing those systematically,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.680]   it can just by nature, improve your site performance
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.080]   or even like things like improving site speed, right?
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.560]   That's not dependent on content creation.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.080]   Yeah, and for me, like I,
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.440]   even from a workflow point of view,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.360]   it's like there's that systematic foundational stuff.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.760]   And I think SEO is almost like to me,
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.800]   synonymous with culture as well.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.040]   Culture meaning like as an organization,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.720]   does everyone believe in the value of SEO,
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.920]   especially those who are creating content
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.120]   and how willing are they to utilize best practices
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.000]   or SEO or keyword research or whatnot.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.160]   And it varies, right?
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.520]   And again, that's not actually a criticism on anyone.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.240]   It's just like, it's tough when you have time to publication
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.000]   and like if the due diligence is not there,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.520]   like how do you work that into it?
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.880]   So I think it's got to evolve.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.680]   It's got to be a part of culture.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.280]   It has to be like a part of discussion.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.200]   Otherwise like you'll systematically
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.240]   or always be fixing things retroactively
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.560]   instead of getting ahead of it.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.520]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.840]   That's a really good point of like,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.120]   they just don't have SEO first
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.600]   or even SEO third approach,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.440]   if you want to take it from that.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.520]   There's no one inside evangelizing for it.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.480]   Like you said, everyone has their own schedule to meet,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.920]   their own weekends they want to get to.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.480]   And it's like, unless someone's making that obvious for them
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.200]   and they're making it a well-oiled machine,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.520]   the parts don't work well together
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.880]   and you kind of get that sloppiness.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.720]   - Yeah, cool.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.200]   I got one more question for you
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.760]   and I want to shift to like your career journey
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.960]   and specifically around like skills
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.160]   that people should be considering
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.800]   if they're trying to look into search engine optimization
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.960]   or marketing as a career.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.600]   So the last technical question I have for you
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.840]   is just around the topic of AI, right?
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.960]   There's a lot of tools out there.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.880]   I don't believe using AI to replace
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.480]   search engine marketing is the way to go,
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.400]   but certainly it should augment.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.240]   And so like, are you using the tools these days
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.080]   to kind of help you out?
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.800]   Or do you see anything, like let's say on the horizon
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.000]   that you think might either change the game
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.800]   or in change, maybe influence our efficacy
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.160]   of creating content or whatnot?
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.000]   - For sure.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.080]   I mean, most recently,
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.680]   chat GPT and just generative AI in general
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.280]   definitely changed the game.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.080]   There is so much you can use it for
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.680]   to augment what you're doing
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.320]   or make your life that much easier.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.560]   Like you have to take a lot of it with a grain of salt,
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.880]   honestly, especially if you're asking it.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.960]   I was reading an article the other day,
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.320]   like certain types of questions,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.640]   like definites versus like what ifs type questions,
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.200]   like that.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.880]   But you can use it to generate content ideas.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.360]   You can use it to do really complex things,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.080]   like hreflangs, like you can put in like,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.640]   identify the international alternate
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.200]   and then write the hreflang in an XML sitemap format.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.520]   And it's like, spits that out for you, which is crazy.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.720]   So, it's definitely in that sense, like, okay,
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.840]   this could be a really big help for us.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.520]   And then in the other sense,
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.280]   there's the stuff that we're seeing going on right now,
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.120]   even like the more macro outside of SEO
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   with like, you know, writers and artists where, you know,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.760]   they're like, okay, you know,
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.720]   this is kind of ripping off our stuff
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.560]   and we're not really not getting credit for this.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.440]   And it's kind of making us obsolete in some senses.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.000]   And that's definitely, you know,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.840]   a big concern in the SEO community,
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.520]   especially since Google announced it's,
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.680]   you know, coming out with that,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.760]   I think it's the SGE,
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.600]   the search generative experience is what it's called.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.920]   And it's essentially just, you know,
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.400]   if you've ever seen, you search something on Google
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.440]   and it has the answer box before you can even get
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.400]   to click into anything and taking that
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.720]   and just amping it up times 10, you know,
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.440]   like scraping all these sites from their content
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.480]   and then pretty much putting a lot of generative AI
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.120]   at the top of the search results
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.640]   and driving down the traditional search results,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.080]   which obviously drives down the visibility,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.600]   the value of the click-through rate.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.720]   So, you know, there's a lot of worry right now
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.860]   of what's gonna happen there.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.260]   And then, yeah, even with like content writing,
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.600]   there are really good uses of it.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.480]   I've seen it work really well in some cases, you know,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.200]   if the human edit it's a bit after or whatever.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.840]   But right now, you know, there's no like policy
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.400]   at Google against using pure AI content.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.640]   So, you know, you could have a competitor overnight,
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.880]   rip out, you know, 20 new articles
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.360]   that really match the quality of your content
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.560]   when they couldn't before.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.640]   And that really changes the level of the playing field.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.120]   So it's the wild west.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.680]   It's hard to say what it's gonna be right now.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.440]   I love it because it makes my job easier.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.600]   But again, I'm gonna take my job, I don't know.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.320]   - Yeah, I agree with you on the last thing you said
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.920]   around like lack of policy, right?
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.360]   I think the things that everyone should be cautious about
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.160]   is like policies will be put in place eventually,
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.640]   or as Google gets more sophisticated
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.040]   in measuring efficacy of content,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.840]   like we've seen penalization of keyword stuffing, right?
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.280]   And so it's not far to imagine
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.880]   penalization of AI source content.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.320]   And there's sniffers out there now, right?
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.840]   You can detect if it's AI written.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.600]   So I definitely agree, like you shouldn't use AI
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.960]   to completely author content without a human review.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.200]   Now things you can do, right?
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.040]   Like you can literally take a article and say,
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.600]   hey, look, rewrite this article,
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.720]   utilizing like these five keywords, X amount of times,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.040]   and focusing on this world event or whatever it is,
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.680]   and it'll spit something out for you.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.200]   But it's up to you to then like reread that
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.840]   and adjust it to fit your tone, voice,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.120]   review for accuracy, et cetera.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.080]   'Cause again, you still wanna come back
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.000]   to a source of where that's not generated by AI.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.840]   'Cause again, you don't wanna be punished by plagiarism
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.240]   or whatever that is.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   - Yeah.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.120]   - Cool, so let's kind of shift gears.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.520]   Like SEO, like how did you kind of come across this?
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.920]   How did you discover this as a field?
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.120]   Like did you have prior experience before doing this
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.840]   or was it kind of out of the blue?
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.720]   - It was kind of out of the blue.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.600]   So I had graduated my undergrad in like 2007.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.920]   It was a music management degree.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.960]   And at that point, I really wasn't sure
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.360]   what I was gonna do with it.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.440]   The landscape had really changed since I got into college.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.160]   Even going back from like Napster just kind of wiped out
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.040]   most of the things you can do with music management
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.160]   as that evolved.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.000]   And so I was like, all right,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.440]   I gotta buy myself more time.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.720]   I'm gonna go to grad school.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.560]   So I went to Suffolk here in Boston and got an MBA.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.720]   And while I was there, I was in a group project
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.440]   with this guy, Victor, who ended up being the VP
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.600]   of analytics at the first agency I worked at.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.800]   We were getting a drink afterward.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.160]   And I just mentioned, I was like,
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.600]   yeah, I gotta figure out something.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   I think I wanna do marketing.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.080]   He's like, well, I'm the vice president
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.600]   at a marketing agency.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.880]   So he got me in for a round of interviews
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.840]   that they had just happened to be doing.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.640]   They were looking to fill a bunch of different positions
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.480]   across different types of media, paid media display,
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.600]   whatever it might be.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.400]   And then for SEO, there was only one guy who did SEO.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.480]   We got into the interview and we were like,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.080]   oh my God, we like a lot of the same things.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.920]   We're all friends with Victor.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.080]   And he's like, you seem like a cool dude.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.160]   As long as you seem like you have some initiative in you,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.200]   let's give it a shot or give it a try, whatever.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.560]   And I did come in thinking, I think this one might be cool.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.600]   I tried to learn a little bit about each thing
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.440]   and just to kind of rattle off things I'd heard online.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.600]   And he's like, you're good.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.880]   So yeah, it really came down to just kind of networking
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.200]   and then personality and gelling.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.320]   I think that's the truth for a lot of jobs,
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.000]   especially when you're getting in at that low level.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.320]   It's like, you can't expect anyone to really know much.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.800]   It's like, you just got to want to learn and be diligent.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.240]   - Yeah, that's hilarious.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.760]   'Cause that mirrors a lot of my own personal experiences
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.480]   as well, especially as it pertains to the field of SEO
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.760]   in particular, like I didn't have prior experience either.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.520]   I think that's something you mentioned there,
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.360]   which is really important is like,
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   obviously you want to know the fundamentals of what it is.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.640]   Even if you haven't practiced it,
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.600]   you just got to know what it's about generally
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.520]   and what the best practices are
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.520]   so you can say at least speak to it.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.680]   But the human element is very, very important
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.120]   'cause it's a very cross-functional discipline, right?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.280]   If your ability to influence cross-functional stakeholders
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.320]   allows you to, I guess, create a better efficacy of a site
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.760]   as a whole, because you have so many
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.680]   different content creators.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.760]   And then that takes a certain individual, right?
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.640]   The one who's more successful at doing that,
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.480]   you're doing less cleanup in the future, right?
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.320]   Retroactively.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.280]   I also feel like having at least some foundation
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.520]   in analytics is important.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.520]   Out of the gate, I think as you described earlier,
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.120]   it's not deep analytics.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.280]   It's pretty straightforward stuff you can learn.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.840]   Again, getting used to interfaces like Google Analytics
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.000]   as one example and knowing what to search.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.600]   Yes, that takes a little time to figure out.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.800]   It can also be learned on the job,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.760]   but being willing to look into data
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.120]   to kind of figure that out allows you to do the whole
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.520]   science versus art piece that you talked about.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.080]   'Cause a part of the art is discovering things, right?
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.800]   So when I've made hires for SEO in the past,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.360]   one thing I look for is almost like
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.000]   an entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.520]   Do you have that go-getter mentality
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   where you just want to figure something out
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.000]   and you're just naturally questioning things?
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.600]   'Cause that's the kind of mindset of an optimist, right?
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.960]   When you are looking at making a hire
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.520]   for, let's say, a first-time career,
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.840]   is there anything else that you're looking for?
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.720]   And then conversely, if you're looking to hire
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.320]   someone who's senior, what are you looking
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.480]   for in that individual?
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.480]   - So you're talking like new hire.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.240]   I think I look for a lot of personality
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.520]   and I think I base it off of my kind of experience.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.680]   Did they actually come in prepared
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.800]   to answer some kind of questions about this
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.320]   and display they had some kind of knowledge?
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.840]   And then I do a lot of it based on personality.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.160]   You gotta work directly with this person.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.240]   You're gonna get along with them.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.160]   So sometimes with new people, it's taking a chance.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.840]   Looking at a more senior person,
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.680]   that's gonna be a much more,
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.160]   there's gonna be a lot more scrutiny
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.800]   in terms of use, not use cases, case studies almost.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.400]   What have you done in this particular situation?
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.000]   What do you think is important for X, Y, Z?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.640]   A lot of things you've been asking me today,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.560]   I'd probably ask them the same things
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.280]   and just try to make sure they understand,
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.840]   did they think the same things are important
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.440]   that I think are important?
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.000]   Obviously that the clients are gonna think important
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.840]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.880]   But that's more a stringent type skills interview
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.120]   and then personality, for sure.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.840]   You can't just hire a guy you like to do something
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.240]   that's gonna be client-facing
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.760]   when they're gonna be all shoulders, like, "I don't know."
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.480]   (laughing)
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.880]   - Yeah, so true.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.320]   Well, Mike, this was a very informative meeting,
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.680]   or not meeting, that's so formal, like a conversation.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.480]   I really enjoyed that.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.720]   How can people find you
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.320]   if they wanna maybe hit you up for some advice
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.360]   or anything else that you wanna showcase?
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.880]   - I think LinkedIn is probably the best place.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.240]   I'm sure we can figure out how to share a link after this
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.200]   and we post this wherever you're gonna do it.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.080]   And then, yeah, hit me up.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.320]   My agency is always looking for new opportunities.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.360]   So if you're in B2B SaaS, we might be able to help you out.
