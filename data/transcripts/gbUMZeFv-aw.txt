[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Pastor John, ten years ago to the month was recorded what I think to be the weirdest video
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.520]   of you preaching.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.240]   You were speaking in front of thousands of Christian counselors in Nashville at the National
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720]   Gathering of the American Association of Christian Counselors.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320]   Some reports claim that there were as many as 8,000 people in attendance.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320]   It was big.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.760]   And there you delivered a message titled, "Beholding Glory and Becoming Whole, Seeing
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.240]   and Savoring God as the Heart of Mental Health."
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.680]   From the start of the message, you poured out your heart, you shared your personal struggles,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.720]   but what makes the video so weird is that for several minutes, the counselors responded
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.760]   to your serious confessions with laughter.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.920]   Here's a brief clip of what I'm talking about.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.680]   So I thought I would spare you the analysis and just go ahead and tell you up front that
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.680]   I'm a sinner.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:11.280]   And I'm a man who, to be more specific, must crucify the love of praise every day.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:22.000]   A man who is prone to freeze up emotionally when he's tired and then feels instinctively
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.120]   justified in blaming it on somebody else.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:35.880]   A man who loves to praise God in the Great Assembly and feels a constraint on my spirit
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.080]   in my own living room.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.000]   All right, now it's about to get really weird.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Check this out.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.120]   A man who never feels sure of his motives, including the ones I feel right now about
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.520]   why I'm doing this.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.440]   And you're a very strange audience, because I totally did not expect laughter.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   And I'm continually perplexed.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.720]   I guess I'd better just get used to it.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   This is a serious talk, in case you're wondering.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.280]   But this is strange.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.640]   So you can just kind of get it out of your system.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.040]   I have so many questions.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.200]   A lot of people have a lot of questions.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.600]   A decade later, Caleb writes in to ask, "Pastor John, am I right in saying that I hear the
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.360]   crowd laughing at you as you poured your heart out to them and became very vulnerable?
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.240]   Seem like they totally miss the fact that you are really being serious with them.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.880]   What in the world happened?"
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.600]   John asks, "It seems like there was a lot of confusion.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.280]   I was just curious on what the reasoning for the response might have been."
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.240]   Adam asks, "Pastor John, your message was encouraging for me in many ways, and I was
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.720]   particularly encouraged and moved by the humility you showed at the beginning of the message
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.240]   when you discussed your struggles with self-focus in your ministry and in your marriage.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   That said, I was disturbed by their audible laughter.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.720]   Judging by your remarks and composure during all of this, I also noticed that you were
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   concerned and disturbed as well.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.320]   What do you remember from the event, and what are your thoughts as you look back now a decade
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320]   later?"
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   Well, you know, this was a long time ago.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.480]   Yeah, it was, yeah.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:32.080]   And I don't live with any ongoing bad feelings or resentment or bitterness to those who were
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.520]   in attendance there.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:42.160]   I hadn't thought about it for years, I think, until I was in Nashville last week in the
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.640]   very hotel where it happened.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.480]   And I said to people, "I've never been here."
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.480]   And then I looked around and said, "Oh, I have been here.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.560]   This is where that happened."
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.760]   So that's where I just stayed three days ago at the Gaylord Hotel in Nashville.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.560]   Well that's where it happened.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.640]   And the farther I have gotten away from it, the less reliable my reconstruction of the
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.680]   moment is likely to be.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:20.160]   So I don't want to make any condemning judgments on their behavior in laughing while I was
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.960]   trying to confess my sins.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:29.680]   But I do have some thoughts about those kinds of events and situations.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.120]   But first, let me help our listeners who don't know anything about what we're talking about
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.740]   have a sense of it.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.200]   So this was a gathering of several thousand Christian counselors under the theme "Grace
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.720]   and Truth," which I think is a wonderful theme.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:59.000]   And my thought was that I would begin my talk by listing my most besetting sins that they
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.200]   could get some sense of whether this speaker was in touch with his own reality.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.240]   I'm kind of self-conscious speaking in front of counselors like, "Whoa, these folks are
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.480]   good at reading people, so I don't want to be fake in any way."
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:22.560]   And so I didn't want to begin in any presumptuous, self-assured, cocky way.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.080]   So I gave nine points.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   And here they are.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   I'll just give you bullet points.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.760]   I am a man who must crucify the love of praise every day.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.560]   I'm a man who struggles with the same adolescent fear at age 63—that was 10 years ago—that
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.600]   he had at age 15, the fear of looking foolish.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.440]   I'm a man who is prone to feel self-pity and pout when he doesn't get love the way he wants.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.840]   I am one who is almost never sure he has used his time in the best way and therefore struggles
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.160]   with guilt.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.000]   I am one who is short on compassion and long on critical analysis.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.120]   My wife lets me know that.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.600]   I am one who can freeze up emotionally when he's tired and feel instinctively that it's
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.040]   someone else's fault.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.800]   I'm one who loves to praise God in the Great Assembly and feels a constraint, nevertheless,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.040]   on my own spirit in my living room with my family.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.620]   Why is that?
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:39.000]   I am one who has loved his wife for 40 years imperfectly and spent with her over three
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.400]   of those years with a Christian counselor, trying to become better images of Christ and
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.000]   the church.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.400]   And I, lastly, am one who never feels sure that his motives are pure, including right
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.360]   now in this moment, for why he's telling you all of this.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.800]   That was how I began the talk, and those are all sincere, and there may be some more or
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.760]   less growth in those over the last 10 years, but I know what I'm talking about there.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.080]   Now, what was disorienting to me was that there was laughter from the audience at points
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   in this litany of my failures, a good bit of it.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:31.960]   It took me totally off guard, and I wasn't sure what to make of it, and I still don't
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:39.200]   know what to make of it, but wise friends have—and you email me one of these—wise
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.360]   friends have cautioned me that there may be reasons for it that I don't see.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.960]   In fact, I am sure that's true.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.080]   But here's what I want to say that's semi-related.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:03.360]   Desiring God, with me as a prominent voice for desiring God, exists to promote the vision
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:11.320]   that we call Christian hedonism, which means that we believe human beings not only may
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:20.240]   pursue their fullest and deepest and highest and widest and most intense joy, happiness,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:29.520]   pleasure, but that we must pursue it in God through Christ if we're going to glorify
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.600]   God the way we should.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.280]   Delight yourself in the Lord, Psalm 37, 4, is a biblical command, not a suggestion, because
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:46.520]   God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in Him, which means I think Christians,
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:52.540]   Christian hedonists in particular, should outrejoice the world.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:59.220]   The treasure of our God and Christ and our salvation and our hope is so spectacularly
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:09.020]   great and so utterly sure that we should be the most hope-filled, joy-filled people in
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   the world.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:19.900]   But here's the irony, the beautiful irony, the culturally disorienting irony, the irony
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:27.360]   that was, I think, at the root of the mystifying miscommunication in that conference, and the
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:38.940]   irony is this, in 50 years, I have never told a joke in a sermon, at least that I can remember.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.260]   Nobody at Desiring God aspires to be a comedian.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.260]   The reason this is felt as an irony, in spite of what I just said about we should be the
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:58.020]   happiest people in the world, the reason it's felt as an irony is that in American culture,
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:04.260]   inside and outside the church, and that's the sad part, inside, categories by and large
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:13.980]   do not exist for the Pauline, the phrase of the Apostle Paul, "sorrowful yet always rejoicing,"
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:23.340]   or for the motto of Bethlehem College and Seminary, "an education in serious joy," or
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.260]   a happy pastor who never tells jokes in his sermons.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.020]   They don't have any categories for that.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.740]   That makes no sense to the world.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.260]   If you're a happy pastor, you're going to tell jokes.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.060]   If you're a happy pastor, you're not going to talk about serious joy, but happy joy,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.060]   and so on.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:44.460]   You're not going to have this sad strain running through your life.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.340]   The world doesn't compute with that very easily.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:54.280]   Now I can't prove this, but I'm going to make a guess here, and the Lord knows.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:05.500]   My guess is that John Piper laughs as much as any pastor he knows.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:11.100]   And I don't mean nervous laughter that covers up awkward feeling moments.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:19.340]   I mean laughter that just busts out, because there are so many surprising foibles in the
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:26.520]   world, so many hilarious, unexpected juxtapositions in the world that you're being confronted
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.700]   with humor at almost every turn.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:42.180]   But there's a world of difference between natural, spontaneous, uncalculated eruptions
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:50.640]   of humor on the one hand, and planned, calculated clowning on the other hand.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:12:00.500]   And by clowning, I mean at conferences, on podcasts, in sermons, trying to sound funny,
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:06.860]   which usually means demeanors and practices and words that create a silly, slapstick,
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:16.060]   jokey, jesting, clever, trifling, young teen summer camp, rah-rah atmosphere, because that's
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.620]   the only alternative to boredom and sadness and sullenness and moroseness and glumness
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.260]   that American culture knows.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.540]   That's just the way the entertainment-saturated culture of America is.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.340]   And I don't fit that culture.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.780]   I don't intend to fit it.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.820]   I don't like it.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:42.940]   I think it grows out of a worldview with a very, very small and negligible God, if any,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:49.540]   and I think it is rampant and damaging in the American church.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:58.020]   And I suspect that I walked into a set of expectations at that conference, given the
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:04.420]   way it had been flowing and given just the American culture of Nashville and the world,
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:11.140]   I walked into a set of expectations at that conference that were so different from my
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:19.820]   own that I didn't help people make the transition as well as I might have.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.340]   So are you saying that that room that we recorded in, Ask Pastor John Live, recently, was that
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.340]   the same room?
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.340]   I don't know.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.220]   I don't know, because the place is, as the kids say, ginormous.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.020]   I mean, there are 2,881 rooms in the Gaylord Hotel.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.740]   It's the biggest hotel in America, if you don't count hotels with casinos, and there
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:49.060]   are six mammoth garden sections, and who knows underneath how many of those places of that
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.520]   whole 10,000 people.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.340]   So I don't know the answer to that.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:57.980]   I just know that when I walked through one of those garden areas over a bridge with a
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.980]   little goldfish underneath it, I said, "I've been here before."
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.980]   Oh, interesting.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.500]   And then I remembered, "Oh, that's where this was."
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.500]   Ten years.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.780]   Yeah, almost ten years to the month that that would have happened, and then we recorded
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.860]   Ask Pastor John Live in the same building.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.860]   That's incredible.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.300]   I'm still trying to wrap my brain around that.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.700]   Well, I'm a total believer in the providence of God.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.820]   I just think whether people laugh at you or don't laugh at you, God is at work, and He
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:31.180]   does His work, and the best thing we can do is not second-guess ourselves.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.500]   In fact, whether something wonderful happens while I'm preaching or something distressing
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.340]   happens while I'm preaching, I'm a very poor judge about what God is doing.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.340]   I really am.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.460]   I have to try to go to bed and say, "Don't think about this very much because you're
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.320]   going to get depressed or discouraged or proud," and just let it go.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.660]   You did your best.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.460]   Be on to the next thing.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.140]   Let God bear the fruit He wants to bear.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.140]   Amen.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.740]   And now a bunch of you want to go watch the full intro to that message.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.980]   I'm sure it's weird.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:03.980]   Brace yourself.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.900]   "Beholding Glory and Becoming Whole, Seeing and Savoring God as the Heart of Mental Health."
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.900]   That's the title.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.900]   You can find the video at DesiringGod.org.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.860]   Well, Pastor John and I have been busy in the recording studio with a whole slate of
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.380]   new episodes for you this fall.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.980]   A lot of great questions have come in from you, and the easiest way to get new episodes
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.980]   is to subscribe to the podcast on your phone or your tablet through your favorite podcast
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.980]   app.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.060]   I use the app called Overcast.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.940]   I know some of you use Downcast.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.180]   And Apple Podcasts is by far now the most popular app among our listeners.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.440]   Whatever app you choose, there you can get the latest episodes delivered immediately
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.540]   to you as we release them.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.080]   Download a podcast app that best works for you and your device, and in that app search
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.300]   for "Ask Pastor John" and click on "Subscribe."
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:56.100]   You can also subscribe to DG's YouTube channel and get all the episodes there as well.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:02.900]   And of course, our entire archive of past episodes is online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.400]   On that site you can find all 1,400 episodes we've released to date and even ask a question
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   of your own.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.540]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.300]   We'll see you Monday for another new episode with Pastor John.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.020]   Thanks for listening.
