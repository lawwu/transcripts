[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   Does John Piper overplay literacy and diminish the glorious power of sermon-centered missions
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.800]   in oral cultures?
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.560]   It's a pushback from a podcast listener named Miles.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.800]   Pastor John, my wife and I have our lives on the trajectory towards doing Bible translations
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.360]   as a career, so I am in no way suggesting that I think the Bible is unimportant.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.560]   But when I think historically of the practice of believers prior to the advent of the printing
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.280]   press and when I think globally about the millions of believers who don't currently
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.680]   have the Bible in a language that they can understand, it seems that our American evangelical
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.840]   ideal of Christian discipleship might be too dependent on assumptions about literacy and
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.760]   access to cheap copies of the Bible.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.040]   There was a video of you, Pastor John, on Facebook on April 19th, and you said, "You
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.960]   don't have a chance against the devil unless you know how to read and understand God's
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.560]   Word."
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.400]   This statement was obviously not intending to convey that people without access to Scripture
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.420]   are hopeless, but I think it reflects to some degree what I'm getting at here.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.680]   Literacy is obviously a good thing, but have we made it a test of genuine faith and obedience?
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.880]   Pastor John, what would you say to Miles?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.560]   Well, I am really glad for this question, especially to correct either a misunderstanding
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.440]   of what I said or to correct a misstatement of what I said.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.360]   I mean, I made the mistake, not anybody else.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.760]   The whole issue of orality in missions has been an issue for me for about 20 years or
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.280]   so, and I'm really glad to say some clarifying things about it.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.520]   So first, let's make some missiological observations and then some biblical observations.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.200]   It's a plain and important fact that there are several thousand languages in the world
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.880]   that do not have complete Bible translations in them.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   The exact number right now is not important for the point I'm making.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.100]   Just the fact that there are any is the point that I'm making.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.060]   Those languages have real people who speak them, people that need to believe on Jesus
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.280]   Christ in order to be saved from the wrath of God.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.160]   And some of these people speak only that unwritten language rather than a trade language in which
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.520]   the Bible exists, and many of them are not yet able to read at all.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.940]   That's one fact.
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.880]   Another fact is that translating the Bible into a language often takes many years, sometimes
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.840]   decades.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.000]   It seems to me patently clear that the people who are without Christ should not have to
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.200]   wait until they have a Bible in their own language in order to hear the gospel, be saved,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.560]   be discipled, form churches, grow in grace and the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.240]   And that implies that someone who knows the scriptures, either because they can read or
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.800]   because someone else told them, must speak, must speak orally, must speak the gospel to
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.480]   the people groups so that they may believe and be saved and grow in grace.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.600]   Therefore, the last thing I want to do is discourage missionaries from penetrating people
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.720]   groups who are preliterate as if evangelism and discipleship were not possible until the
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.360]   people have their own written copies of the Bible or have the ability to read for themselves.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.760]   We take people where they are and give them what we can, and we do it as soon as we can.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.440]   And I don't doubt that God in his mercy through the faithful oral teaching of the scriptures
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.640]   can grow for himself mighty, devil-defeating saints.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.680]   So what I said, or at least what was heard, is wrong.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.720]   I mean, what did they say?
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.960]   I said that you don't have a chance against the devil unless you know how to read and
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.280]   understand God's word.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.960]   So if I said that and I didn't put any qualifiers around it, then I'm just plain wrong.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:41.560]   What I mean by qualifiers is I hope I said or implied that if you can't read the Bible
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.000]   for yourself, you have to depend on somebody else who can read.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.720]   So reading is essential.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.440]   You can read the Bible to tell you what it says because, in fact, without the word of
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.840]   God—I'm going to say this—without the word of God, we cannot defeat the devil.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.840]   So let's be clear.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.920]   A new convert who believes the gospel and cannot read can defeat the devil.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   Got that?
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   I say it.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.440]   A non-reader who is preliterate can defeat the devil, but he can only defeat the devil
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.600]   by faith, 1 Peter 5:9, and faith flourishes by the word of God.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.720]   Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:39.860]   So if a person can't read, he'll be dependent for his devil-defeating power to be fed the
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.400]   word by somebody who can read or has been taught by somebody who can read.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.000]   Christianity is not magic.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.040]   It is faith in a historical reality mediated through inspired writing and believed by the
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.120]   power of the Spirit.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.640]   Now, here are the biblical observations I had in mind when I said missiological observations
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.760]   and biblical ones.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.640]   Here's three.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.200]   And I'm so glad to hear that Miles and his wife care about Bible translation because
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.880]   that really clues me into where they're coming from.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.800]   They just don't want to minimize the necessity of oral dimensions of discipleship, which
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.280]   is what I'm trying to rectify here.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.240]   Number one, the Apostle Paul said in Ephesians 3, 4, "By reading, you can perceive my insight
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.000]   into the mysteries of Christ."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.920]   This is absolutely astonishing.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.440]   Paul is the inspired representative of the risen Christ, and he's been given profound
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.880]   insight into the mysteries of Christ.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:54.360]   And he says, "By reading," it's a participle, just says, "Reading, you can join him in spiritual
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.140]   perception of divine reality."
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.840]   Nothing could elevate reading more highly than that sentence.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:09.640]   And all of us should want that for ourselves and want it for everybody we can help.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.720]   So the priority of reading is huge, and Christianity has always been building schools and building
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.860]   hospitals wherever they go.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.320]   Number two, second biblical observation.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.840]   The words of the Lord are true and righteous, Psalm 1910.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.400]   More to be desired are they than gold, much fine gold, sweeter also than drippings from
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:40.720]   the honeycomb or Psalm 119.72, "The law of the Lord is better to me than thousands of
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.100]   gold and silver pieces."
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.600]   In other words, to possess the words of God is a great treasure.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:56.960]   To be sure, somebody who can't read but has the word of God stored up in his heart orally
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:06.400]   is better off than a literate person who has a Bible and it just sits on the shelf collecting
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.240]   dust.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.080]   But when you are holding the written word of God in your hands, you are holding a treasure
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.380]   better than tens of thousands of gold and silver pieces.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:26.880]   And every Christian virtue I can think of inclines me to want others to be able to hold
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.120]   it in their hands as well and read it.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   And the last biblical observation would be to simply observe that paternalism of missionaries
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:48.000]   over new churches and the breeding of perpetual dependence in younger churches is something
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.780]   to be avoided like the plague in missions.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:09:00.320]   And as long as we have the Bible and we are the readers and we are the teachers and they
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   don't have the Bible and they don't have the teachers and they can't read, well, they're
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.800]   in a position of dependence and we're in a position of power and control, and that should
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   not go on indefinitely.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:22.980]   And this is what has lamed so many younger churches over the centuries, a perpetual dependence
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:28.260]   on outside influence for the understanding and teaching of the word of God.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:35.460]   So my conclusion is, by all means, give the gospel.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:43.180]   Let's give the gospel to pre-literate people as soon as we can.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:50.660]   And let's not postpone disciple making until a written Bible is available in their language.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:56.900]   And even in our own culture, if there are people who for various reasons are not able
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.660]   to read or find it very difficult to read.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.380]   I remember asking a young man one time, "What are you reading?"
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.460]   And he's about 30 years old.
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.460]   He said, "I don't read."
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.660]   I said, "You mean not even magazines?"
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.660]   He said, "No."
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.580]   I said, "What a revelation."
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.220]   There are people who either by disposition or dyslexia or other kinds of things that
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.220]   just don't read.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.180]   They don't ever read.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.540]   We must not neglect those people.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.540]   We must not.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:31.120]   We must be about the business of strategies of disciple making.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:38.460]   So we do what we can do, for nobody lives by bread alone but by every word that comes
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.640]   out of the mouth of God.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   So we must not neglect the people who are willing to read and to follow the word of
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   God.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   And we must not neglect the people who are willing to follow the word of God.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   And we must not neglect the people who are willing to follow the word of God.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   And we must not neglect the people who are willing to follow the word of God.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:18.460]   And we must not neglect the people who are willing to follow the word of God.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:18.960]   Amen.
