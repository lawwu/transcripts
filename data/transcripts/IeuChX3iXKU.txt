[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Owing to a very bad fault in the original recording, the first few moments of the
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.480]   Doctor's introductory remarks of this message are missing. We join him as he is establishing
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.080]   the importance of understanding the message of the early Church.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.800]   And my argument is that the only honest thing to do if we want to know what the Church is,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.160]   or what Christianity is, or what a Christian is, is to go back to this book of the Acts of the
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.760]   Apostles. What right has a man in the 20th century to say this is the Church? What's his authority?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.080]   What's his sanction? If you want to know what it is, well, I should say that honesty dictates alone
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.440]   without going any further, that we must go back to the origin, to the beginning. How did it ever
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.000]   come to be? It's a long story. It goes back the best part of 2,000 years. What is it?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.920]   Now this, to me, is the great and the all-important question that we must face at the present time,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.360]   and here we've got it. You remember this tremendous thing that happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.880]   The apostles and 120 people were in an upper room. Suddenly the Holy Spirit came down upon them,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.080]   and they were all changed, filled with a sense of glory and of power, spake with other tongues,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.840]   and then a crowd came gathering together. This thing had become a phenomenon,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.520]   and the apostle Peter stood up and addressed them. He preached a sermon to them, the first
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.440]   great Christian sermon, if you like, and it was as the result of that preaching that we are told
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.640]   in verse 37 that when they heard this, that's to say these people who had come together and were
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.760]   listening, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.400]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.360]   of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.440]   gift of the Holy Ghost," and so on. With many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.320]   "Save yourselves from this crooked, this untoward, this recalcitrant, rebellious generation."
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.760]   Then we are told that they that gladly received his word were baptized,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.920]   and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.000]   And these people joined the church. They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrine
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.920]   and fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayers. Now then, our argument so far has come
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   to this, that obviously what makes a man a Christian is that he undergoes this tremendous
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.840]   conviction, conviction of sin, conviction that he's been all wrong in all his thinking. These
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.200]   are the people who had a few weeks before been crying out about Jesus of Nazareth, "Away with
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.600]   him! Crucify him! Rejected him!" They now see they've made a tragic blunder and they're in
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400]   trouble. They've rejected the Son of God. They can see Peter's sermon has convinced them.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.920]   They're pricked in their hearts. They're alarmed. They say, "What can we do?"
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.960]   So they underwent this profound change in their thinking, in their feelings,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.040]   and they desire to do something different. Now that's what makes a man a Christian.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.920]   He's a man who's undergone the profoundest change a man can ever know. It's called in the Bible a
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:34.000]   rebirth, regeneration. He's become a new man. All things have passed away. Behold, all things have
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.920]   become new. He's a new man, and he proceeds to demonstrate that. How does he do so? Well, we've
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.160]   seen this. He demonstrates that he's become a new man because he really does leave the world. Peter
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.200]   in the sermon said, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation," and he does so. He realizes
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.400]   the world is doomed, so he gets away from it, and then he attaches himself positively to the church,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.440]   and he does so steadfastly. They continued steadfastly. Verse 44, "All they that believed
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.280]   were together." Verse 46, "They, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.720]   from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart." Here it is.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.640]   They've all come together. What have they come together for? Well, as I told you last Sunday
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.560]   night, not for whisk drives, not for dances, not for raffles, not for bingo, not for drama.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.000]   What did they come together for? The apostles' teaching, apostles' teaching, apostles' doctrine.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.920]   This is the thing that is put first. Last Sunday night, I gave you the reasons why they desired
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.720]   this teaching. My argument was that it's inevitable, as a newborn babe desires its mother's
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.560]   milk. So, Peter argues, every newborn babe desires the sincere milk of the word that he may grow
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.320]   thereby. He wants to know more about it, and thank God it is a specific teaching,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.720]   and I gave you a hurried summary at the end last Sunday night as to what it is.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.080]   But now, we can't leave this at that point, because I know when I say all this, I am saying
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.400]   something that is the exact opposite of what is most popular at the present time.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.920]   The modern man has a rooted objection to Christian doctrine, Christian dogma,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:39.280]   Christian creeds. He hates them, and this is the subject with which I want to deal this evening,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.840]   because here we are told about the early Christians that what they desired above
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.920]   everything else was this Christian teaching, this Christian doctrine.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.520]   And yet, this is the thing I say that is being dismissed at the present time.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.840]   This is obviously, therefore, a tremendously serious matter.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.640]   Now, there are people out in the world who dislike Christian doctrine,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.680]   and I've, in a sense, got no complaint against them at all. I wouldn't expect them to like it.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.240]   They wouldn't be where they are if they did like it. You don't expect anything from the world except
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.000]   rejection of Christian teaching. The world has always done that. There's nothing new about this,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.640]   nothing new at all. It was the world that rejected the Lord Jesus Christ and his teaching.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.240]   It was the same world that rejected the teaching of these apostles. There's nothing new about that.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.040]   We don't expect the world to do anything different. But this is what is new today,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.800]   and this is what is alarming, and this is what is tragic, that the opposition to Christian
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.160]   doctrine is not confined to the world. It's at the very center of the teaching of the Church herself.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.760]   Now, this is the position which I want to hold before you. This is what is so serious,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.320]   that the Church herself is now speaking against Christian doctrine
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.240]   in saying that that isn't what's needed, that that's no longer of any value whatsoever.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:25.200]   Now, I gave you a quotation about this last Sunday night, and I want to give you some further
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.760]   quotations tonight in order that you may know exactly the kind of situation which we are having
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:41.920]   to meet. I read to you out of a little booklet bearing the title, "Not So Much a Creed, More
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.440]   a Way of Life." Forget the cleverness. There's nothing in that, but it's what it says inside
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.880]   that matters. And here it is again. "A Christian Church, we are told, may still perform a useful
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.360]   service in teaching men the Christian way of life, and in persuading and helping them to walk in this
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:10.080]   way." Now, he says that after he said something like this. "Throughout the ages, Christianity has
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.400]   been taught as a theology, a body of beliefs about God and his dealings with mankind. It concerned
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.560]   the creation, the fall of men, the awful consequences of the fall. It concerned God's plan
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.880]   of salvation, whereby he came down to earth as a man, was crucified, rose again from the dead,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.400]   and ascended into heaven in order to make possible the forgiveness of sins and the gift of eternal
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:41.440]   life to those who by faith accepted this amazing sacrifice of himself for the sins of the world.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.400]   These are the topics about which the councils of the Church disputed, and about which they
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:55.040]   drew up the creed." Then, of course, here's the characteristic word. "Modern education in geology,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:04.400]   in astronomy, in history, and in simple logic, has made the old beliefs incredible to most people
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:12.160]   today. It has created an attitude of mind which just cannot accept them as true, as if everybody
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.720]   until this generation had believed a whole lot, and there had never been any objection to Christian
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.840]   doctrine." Here it is, you see. Does this mean the end of Christianity? Are we about to enter
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.960]   the post-Christian age? Well, in his kindness, he says, "The Christian Church may still perform a
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:35.200]   useful service in teaching men the Christian way of life, and in persuading them and helping them
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:44.480]   to walk in this way. We may rightly rejoice that the Christian spirit is very widely active outside
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.200]   Christian churches, but we must also recognize that it does not yet dominate the lives of most
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.960]   of us." Now, that's a typical example of this modern position. Let me give you another one.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:06.240]   I come across all this quite by accident at random. I wasn't looking for it. But week by week,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.840]   as I'm going through this series of sermons, these are things that I find in the daily press.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:20.000]   Listen to this, which I read last Monday. "At a time when the role of the Church in modern society
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.240]   seems dubious, and the survival of Christianity doubtful." They write well, don't they?
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.560]   And you can't help feeling that they know that they do.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.800]   "At a time when the role of the Church in modern society seems dubious,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:46.080]   and the survival of Christianity doubtful." Then it goes on to deal with the book which
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.280]   is being reviewed. "It is harder," says the author of this book, "it is harder for the modern men to
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:00.080]   believe in the Christian faith than it was for his forebears. Scientific and social revolution
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:08.720]   have produced the assumption that with knowledge and power, men can make their own world. Life
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.320]   has become a do-it-yourself affair, and the sense of providence has been weakened.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.960]   Whereas men once prayed for rain, he now builds reservoirs."
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:30.320]   I must preach on that last sentence sometime, not tonight.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.040]   "Whereas men once prayed for rain, he now builds reservoirs."
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:43.520]   I remember reading only last summer of the great trouble in certain cities. The water
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.800]   had to be turned off at a given hour. Why? Well, because the level of water in the reservoirs
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:55.040]   had gone so low. All right, work out that for yourselves. I'll try to deal with it on some
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.440]   subsequent occasion. Now, these are typical of this modern attitude with which we are dealing.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.520]   But there is one about which I am particularly concerned.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.680]   Now, I'm going to quote now from a religious paper. The others were secular papers,
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.880]   though dealing with religious books and with religious subjects,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.600]   they were secular papers. But I'm now going to quote to you from the British Weekly,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   a free church nonconformist weekly religious paper.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.880]   He puts it like this. "I don't know whether you've read in your papers during this last week. I'm
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.000]   glad that the thing has become public because I can therefore deal with it in a way that
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.200]   would not have been so easy last Sunday, for instance. Advertisements have been sent to many
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:55.360]   people recently about a proposed new magazine, which is to be called Penthouse. You may have
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:01.680]   read of the cases in the courts. I think it was on Friday. The reports were in the paper yesterday.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.520]   Well, amongst other people, I received this advertisement two or three weeks ago.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   And the British Weekly, a fortnight ago, diverted a leading article to it and gave still further
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:20.800]   space. And it made a tremendous attack upon this proposed new magazine. In this advertisement,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:28.560]   you see photographs of nude women and various other such photographs, and an indication is
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.680]   given as to what the contents of this magazine is to be. Now, the British Weekly attacks this,
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.520]   attacks it violently, says it should be stopped, that it's terrible that such a magazine should
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:50.560]   be allowed to be produced in this country. And it quotes a statement in this advertisement,
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:57.920]   the advertisers of this proposed magazine say that the people who are going to contribute to
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   it constitute the nerve center of Britain's creative community. The British Weekly aghast
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:13.520]   says what arrogant nonsense. The nerve center of Britain's creative community is with men like
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.120]   Sargent and Spence and Bunny and Robinson, that's the Bishop of Woolwich, and Tillich,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:27.120]   the American theologian, as he's called, and all those whose genius is related to the creation of
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:34.080]   truth, beauty, and goodness. It goes on, why should a body of people who totally reject morality
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:40.640]   as we know it, and who offer moral anarchy in its place, blame society if in its own total
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:48.560]   interests it sets a limit somewhere. Now, this is the thing that concerns me more than anything else.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:56.800]   Here you see is a religious paper attacking this immorality as it regards it, and it even goes
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:03.520]   further and says that this is pandering to the prurient and everything that is unworthy. The
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.360]   British Weekly holds up its hands aghast, this is terrible itself. But you notice the way it puts it.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:16.000]   It says these men behind this magazine are not the nerve center of Britain's creative community.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.480]   Who are these? Who really are the nerve center of Britain's creative community?
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.880]   And here you get your list, and the two I'm interested in are Robinson, John Robinson,
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:32.960]   Bishop of Woolwich, the author of, you remember the famous book Honest to God, and who draws so
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:39.280]   much on the theology of the other men mentioned, namely Professor Tillich, Dr. Tillich of America.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:46.960]   These men whose genius is related to the creation of truth, beauty, and goodness.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.680]   Now, here it seems to me is the thing to which we must address ourselves.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:16:01.120]   Here you see men who are alarmed at the moral declension taking place in this country.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:09.840]   The open, arrogant, unashamed vice, the selling of it in books, the suggestion of it in plays,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.560]   and on the television, and so on. They hold up their holy hands in horror at all this.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:22.160]   This is terrible, they say. And they say these intellectuals who are behind this proposal,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.400]   they mustn't make this claim that they are the nerve center of the creative community
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   in Britain. No, no, the people who are at the nerve center of the creative community
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.800]   are the Bishop of Woolwich, and Tillich, and some of these others who are mentioned who are
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.320]   prominent in other realms and in other spheres. Now, why am I so concerned about this? Well,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:50.800]   I'm concerned about it for this reason. Here is a paper alarmed at the moral declension,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:17:03.040]   and yet at the same time attacking the apostolic teaching, and lobbying men who are doing their
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:10.160]   utmost to deny the apostles' doctrine and teaching. Now, this is a very serious thing,
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:17.600]   because it is to me of all attitudes the most hopeless. Shall I be misunderstood,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:24.480]   I wonder, when I say this? I see much greater hope for the people who are producing Penthouse
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.080]   than I do for the Bishop of Woolwich, and Tillich, and others who follow the same
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:36.560]   school of thought. Why do I say a thing like that? Well, let me give you my answer.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:44.320]   Here, to me, is the greatest problem at the present time, that the Christian church herself
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.760]   is attacking the only doctrine and teaching that can deal with the moral situation,
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   and yet it doesn't see that. It's blind to it, alarmed at the moral situation,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.200]   but attacking and denying the only message that can deal with it.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.680]   Now, let me put that to you. Let me put it like this. What is our answer, then,
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.800]   in terms of an exposition of this second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles? Well,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.240]   I'm not going to waste your time with all this nonsense about the modern man.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:22.480]   Fancy talking about geology and biology as if it's our modern knowledge that makes people
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.440]   deny the gospel and live a life of zim. The New Testament's full of that sort of thing.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:34.960]   I think this is a most interesting psychological problem, how people can write such utter nonsense.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:42.240]   This is as old as Christianity. The denial of the truth is as old as the truth.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.320]   Let that go. Come to the second point.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:54.160]   The astounding thing to me about these people is that they simply cannot see that it is their
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.320]   own attitude that in many ways has produced the moral problem about which they're now so alarmed.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.240]   Why has there been a declension in the morals of this country during the past years?
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.640]   What's the explanation of it? There, surely, is the fundamental problem,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:17.120]   and to me there's only one answer to that question. It is not the two world wars. I know
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.640]   they've contributed, undoubtedly they've contributed, but it is not the two world wars.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.120]   It isn't the advance of knowledge. There are some of us who have had a little bit of scientific
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.240]   training, perhaps more than these people who write so cleverly, who are literary men generally,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.560]   but still believe this message. It isn't the advance of knowledge. What has been the main
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:45.040]   factor in the lowering of the moral tone and life of this country? I have no hesitation
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.880]   in answering that. It has been the loss of the authority of the Bible.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:57.440]   And the institution that has been most responsible
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.320]   for the losing of the authority of the Bible has been the Christian church herself.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.840]   For the last hundred years, scholarship, as it's called, has been attacking the truth of the Bible,
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.200]   and they're telling us that the Bible is only an ordinary book like every other book. That's what
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.120]   John Wilson of Woolwich says, and that's what Tillich says. These men have riddled the Bible
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.480]   with their criticism. There's no authority here any longer. They simply put up their own
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.520]   suppositions, their own theories, and their own speculations. The church, with her higher
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.120]   criticism, so-called, has literally undermined the confidence of people in the Bible. They say
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   you mustn't take it as an authoritative word. It can't be. We know now that it's just like every
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:52.000]   other book, a compilation like many other similar books. Now, there's been no question about this at
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.960]   all. Or let me put it in another way, which to me is very fascinating, as a mere psychological study.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.920]   During this present century in particular, there's been a great reaction
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.000]   against the old evangelical preaching, the old apostolic doctrine.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.320]   And instead of it, men have been preaching what was called before the First World War,
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:22.880]   a social gospel. Preachers used to say, no, no, that old gospel of individual personal salvation,
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.760]   it's no good. What we need is a social message. So they've been preaching social gospel,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.720]   ethical teaching. They say that's the only way to redeem society. And this is the interesting
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.440]   thing. The more they've done that, and the less they've preached the apostolic doctrine,
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.920]   the more the immorality and the vice and the ethical problem have increased.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:49.600]   It is the very thing that they themselves have been doing that has aggravated the problem.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:58.640]   They're undermining of the old gospel, and they're preaching a purely ethical, social gospel.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   It's produced the problem, which they're now holding up their holy hands aghast at.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.800]   They don't see that. They don't read their Bibles, you see.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.720]   If they read the Old Testament alone, they'd find this,
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:17.040]   that it was always when Israel turned her back upon God that she sank into immorality.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.480]   And she only returned to morality and the Ten Commandments when she was in the right relationship
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.560]   to God. Indeed, history proves the same thing. The most moral, the most productive, the most
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:37.040]   uplifting epochs and eras in the history of this country have always been those that have followed
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:43.760]   religious revivals and reawakenings. The Elizabethan era following the Reformation,
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:51.360]   the Cromwellian period, Puritan influence, all that followed the Methodist or evangelical
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.560]   awakening of the 18th century. You see, the British Weekly talks about the morality to
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.120]   which we've been accustomed. What is that? That's the morality that came directly out
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.760]   of the evangelical revival, the preaching of apostolic doctrine. It doesn't say that.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.800]   They mustn't have it both ways. They can't have it both ways. The morality to which we've been
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.520]   accustomed was the direct outcome of this preaching and teaching, the thing they're
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:22.000]   attacking. Thus you see this tragic inconsistency. But let me give you a third reason, a third
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.280]   reason for rejecting this extraordinary position. It's this.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:34.800]   This teaching, which dismisses the teaching and the doctrine,
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:42.640]   and simply puts up an ethical way of life, and the teaching of Christ alone,
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:49.040]   is the ultimate and final denial of Christ.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:56.480]   That was the whole trouble with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.840]   Do you remember what our Lord said one day to these Pharisees and scribes?
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.960]   He contrasted them with the publicans and the harlots. He said, "John came unto you in the way
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:16.480]   of righteousness, and ye believed him not." But the publicans and the sinners believed him.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:23.760]   "And ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterwards that ye might believe him."
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.680]   In other words, our Lord always made this perfectly clear.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.040]   There is more hope for the publican, the sinner, the harlot,
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:40.800]   the people, I say, who produce penthouse, or who are hoping to produce it. There is more hope for
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:47.840]   them in the end than there is for your Pharisee. Who's the Pharisee? Well, the Pharisee is the man
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:54.720]   who is interested in the teaching of Christ, but denies him at the most vital and essential points.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.800]   What are those? Oh, what a night the Pharisees was when Christ told them that they were sinners.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.760]   They were always pointing to the publican. They get excited when a prurient magazine
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.040]   is about to be produced, and they point at them. Christ said, "You are worse than those.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.640]   You are self-righteous. You think you can save yourselves. You are satisfied with your morality.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.360]   And when I say that I've come to die for you and to save you, and that it's the only way
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.320]   whereby you can be saved, you reject me and you hate me." And that's what these people are doing
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:38.240]   today. That is the final blasphemy. That is the final denial of Christ. There is more hope in
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:46.160]   London tonight for the hopeless drunkard, your alcoholics, your prostitutes, people who are
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.440]   in the very gutters of sin. There's more hope for them tonight than these people who say,
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.800]   "All we want is the teaching of Jesus, and we can imitate him,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.680]   and follow his example, and put ourselves right with God." That's the final denial.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.760]   But they're not aware of this.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:12.480]   These people, like the late Lord Burkett, who once had been a Methodist local preacher,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.280]   but who'd given that up, and he was interviewed on television, and he was asked, "What's your
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   position now?" "Well, of course," he said with a smile, "I no longer believe the doctrines,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:32.640]   but I still hold on to the ethic." Poor men. Rejecting the doctrines, holding on to the ethic.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:41.520]   So I come to my last count in this general way, which is this, that all this writing,
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.160]   this clever writing, is finally to be rejected because of its utter futility, because of its
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.720]   utter uselessness. It doesn't work. It's got nothing to give. It's got nothing to offer.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.840]   Indeed, it's got no answer to the people who want to produce Penthouse.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.200]   The people who produce Penthouse say, "This is our view of life." You people say it's wrong,
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.800]   but what right have you to say it's wrong? We think it's all right. This is what we think
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.280]   is interesting. This is what we think produces happiness in this world. But you mustn't say
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.840]   that, say these other people. The Penthouse people reply, "Why not?" Well, their only answer is
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:23.840]   because we say so. They don't say the Bible says it. We say so, but it's no answer. The others have
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:29.120]   as much right to their personal opinion as these people who pick and choose in the Bible and reject
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.160]   the death of Christ and just emphasize his teaching. It's exactly the same position,
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.760]   so they have no right to criticize. Their criticism is useless, and all that they propose
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.840]   is completely futile. Why? I want to answer that question.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:52.480]   Why is it utterly futile to put anything before doctrine? They continued steadfastly in the
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:57.840]   apostles' teaching doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayer. Why must we put
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.280]   doctrine first? Why is it wrong to say doctrine doesn't matter? It's a way of life we want,
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.640]   not so much a creed, more a way of life, this popular idea that modern men cannot possibly
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.760]   believe the doctrines. He wants ethical teaching. He wants exhortation. He wants to be shown how to
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.920]   live, and then he'll live it. Why is this to be rejected as of the very devil? Here are my answers.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:30.400]   The first is that it has no standard of right to put before us, none at all. It's got no authority.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:37.520]   We are living in an age which is very similar to the time of the judges spoken of in the Old
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:44.080]   Testament. That age is summarized in these words, "In those days there was no king in Israel.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.360]   Every man did that which was right in his own sight." And that's what's happening today.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:56.880]   No authority, no standard. "You mustn't do that," say people. The others reply, "Why not?"
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:03.200]   You see, if it's all just your opinion and mine, well, very well, do what you like.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:10.720]   Everything becomes entirely relative. Now let me show you the terrible danger of this position.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:17.040]   I am now going to quote to you out of the autobiography of Mr. C. Day Lewis,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.520]   one-time professor of poetry in the University of Oxford. He's written his autobiography. He's
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:31.200]   not a Christian, but this is what he says of his life in Oxford. "Each proposition advanced by
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   Plato or Aristotle, Hume or Berkeley, Spinoza or Kant seemed irrefutable till I read the opposite
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:49.040]   viewpoint. It appeared that of everything that was true, the opposite was true." This is what he
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:55.200]   learned in Oxford. Then he quotes from a cynical verse that was written by a friend of his. And
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:03.600]   here's the verse. "In case you think my education wasted, I hasten to explain that having once been
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.840]   to Oxford, you can never really again believe anything that anyone says, and that, of course,
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:17.200]   is an asset in a world like this." I have done my best to read it as poetry.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.240]   But you see, Mr. C. Day Lewis goes on to say that he didn't find it to be an asset.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:36.640]   Having once been to Oxford, you can never really again believe anything that anyone says.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:42.240]   Very cleverly, the other men can prove it wrong. You believe the thing you read first,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.400]   but then you read the opposite, and you see that's true. Well, now, C. Day Lewis tells us he
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.760]   was in trouble. It was disturbing and distressing to him. He confesses, and these are his words,
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:58.480]   "My mental confusion spread outward from the subject I was reading to the life around me,
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.240]   so that I found it difficult to make up my mind about anything at all."
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.920]   He says they produced a mental state of doubt, uncertainty,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.760]   skepticism, and confusion that made positive action almost impossible.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:22.640]   Extreme doubt, he says, is like a thick fog. Now, here is a man, an able man,
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:28.400]   who gets the best education that this country can provide, but you see where it leaves him.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:35.040]   He is uncertain about anything or everything. What can you believe? There's no authority,
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:40.240]   there's no sanction at all. One man's opinion is as good as another, and not only that,
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:45.840]   these ideas are always changing. There was a time when everybody would agree in condemning
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:52.320]   sexual perversions. Not today, they're almost being gloried in. That's public opinion,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.440]   that's public notions with respect to morality. You never know. It's right today, it may be wrong
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.520]   tomorrow. You're never certain of anything, and everything's moving and shifting. Where are you?
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.040]   What are you to do? There's no standard. What's the use of condemning this proposed magazine?
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.040]   What authority have you got for doing it? Perhaps that'll be right tomorrow. Perhaps the philosophers
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.320]   will all be on that side. You don't know. You've no authority, you've got nothing on which you can
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:25.520]   rest. No, no, my friends, there's only one standard, and that is the standard of God's law,
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:32.960]   which is eternal and unchangeable. The Old Testament has faced the problems that the
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:40.720]   modern world faces. Your Davids and your Solomons, they could teach many people who like to play with
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:48.640]   sin what it really means. These sniveling people who sin vicariously in cinemas and looking at
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:56.160]   pictures, these were men, they were manly men, and they knew what sin was. They've been through all
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   this before, and they come to this conclusion, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.840]   Nothing else is of any value. You've got to come here, it's eternal, it's absolute,
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:14.240]   it's unchanging and unchangeable. Let philosophic theories come and go, let climates of opinion
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   change, let winds of change blow in every sense, moral and ethical, as well as political.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:27.600]   Here is something that abides. And it's the only thing that abides.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   There is no standard, ultimately, apart from the law of God, which is universal in its application.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.120]   And, of course, it was because it had that law that the nation of Israel, the Jews,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:51.600]   stood out in the ancient world. They were the most moral and ethical people, for that one reason,
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:58.400]   that it wasn't all speculation and relative positions. They had the law of God, as it had
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:05.920]   been revealed to them. It accounts for their uniqueness. Very well, then, there is my first
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:12.800]   reason for rejecting, as the very plague itself, this modern suggestion that we don't need the
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.760]   apostles' doctrine, that we simply need ethical teaching. My second reason is this one.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.840]   That not only does it not give us any standard by which to live,
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.320]   it doesn't give us any reason why we should live it either.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:35.520]   This is equally important. I have no standards. But now, why should I be concerned even about
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:41.440]   standards? Why should the ethical problem engage my attention? Why should I be troubled by the
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:46.960]   proposal to print this magazine and similar things? Why should I be disturbed at the
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.600]   tendencies that are so evident before our eyes? Now, here, you see, there is no reason given,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.360]   there is no motive given to me at all, as to why I should try to be moral and ethical,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.240]   why I should try to live a good life. No reason.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   There is no ultimate motive suggested.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.720]   And this question of motive is a very important one, which I could illustrate in many other ways.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:20.560]   I think this whole question of motive is very important, even industrially, in this country
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:30.160]   today. I am not here to preach politics, and I never do. But I think it is a fallacy to assume
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.320]   that if a man
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:42.160]   belongs to some national industry that he'll work as well as he did before,
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.760]   when it paid him to work well, I think you'll find you'll be in trouble.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.040]   The profit motive is an important one. Why? Well, because of the biblical doctrine of men,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:59.200]   which I'm about to tell you about. You see, there's this idea, "Just hold the ideal before
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:05.600]   me and they'll all rise to it." Will they? Do they? Wait a minute. The appeal, you see,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:12.000]   of this teaching which excludes doctrine and only preaches ethics and morality and conduct,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.440]   it's too narrow. It's only interested in man's conduct. It isn't interested in man himself.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.800]   It's only interested in time. It knows nothing about eternity. It's all too contingent. It's
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:32.160]   all too small. And it's all due, as I say, to the fact that it is based on an entirely false view
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:39.200]   of man. It's because it rejects doctrine. Now, the Apostle Paul has put this in a very vivid
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:46.720]   phrase for us. It's in that great fifteenth chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.360]   where he deals with the doctrine of the resurrection. There were people in Corinth,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.280]   nineteen hundred years ago, who were beginning to say, "It didn't matter whether you believed
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.080]   in the literal, physical resurrection of Christ or not. You see, you can get a great advantage
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.400]   from his teaching. You're not bound to believe that he literally rose in the body from the grave."
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:09.840]   And the Apostle writes that tremendous chapter of fifty-eight verses in order to refute that.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:16.880]   And this is what he says. Be careful, be careful. "Evil communications corrupt good manners."
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:23.760]   He means this. Once you begin to go astray in your doctrine, you'll very soon be going astray
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:30.320]   in your behavior. You can't diverse doctrine from behavior. "Evil communications corrupt good
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.160]   manners." It is essential, he says, that we should hold on to this. And this is the thing
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:41.200]   that we need to remind men and women of today. I'm arguing that the present condition is the
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:48.160]   result of the rejection of doctrine. It's the inevitable result. And you'll never deal with
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.880]   it until you come back to the doctrine, which men are dismissing as being irrelevant and
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.080]   unnecessary. What am I thinking of? Well, I'm thinking of things like this.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:06.160]   This modern teaching has no conception whatsoever of the depth of sin in fallen human nature,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.760]   none whatsoever. And this is something which is really very surprising.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:19.600]   Let me give you again a quotation from a secular writer, and I choose this deliberately.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:28.480]   "In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries some, not all, emancipated thinkers."
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:36.800]   You notice these phrases, don't you? "Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries emancipated thinkers."
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.080]   They were all slaves until the eighteenth century, remember? All men were stupid until
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.160]   the enlightenment of the eighteenth century and the great scientific advance of the
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.120]   emancipated thinkers. "In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries some emancipated thinkers
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:58.400]   developed an optimistic view of the nature of men. They saw him basically as a noble savage,
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:07.600]   an innocent corrupted by society. This view still lives in the doctrines of Karl Marx.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:16.400]   But the political experiences of this century have not encouraged such optimism."
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:23.920]   How true. In this century also scientific study has discovered much about the source
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:31.600]   of human emotions. This is beginning to explain, among other things, why our propensity for
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:39.840]   destructiveness is as great as the pessimism of theology had imagined. This is tremendous.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:47.520]   "But man's control of himself remains much less thoroughly explored than any other aspect
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.720]   of his situation." What does all that mean? Let me translate it to you.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:40:00.400]   What he is saying is this, that the optimists of the end of the last century had a very optimistic
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.760]   view of men. They said, "Man's a noble savage. He is a wonderful fellow, but his environment
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.800]   has always been against him. He has been corrupted by society, and therefore all you
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:17.520]   need is to change society. Put society right and man will reveal his nobility. But," says this man,
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.160]   "political experiences," he's referring to the two world wars,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.080]   "have not encouraged such optimism. I should think not."
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:32.240]   And today it's still less encouraged, isn't it? And what he says is astounding is this,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:38.000]   that scientific study has discovered much about the source of human emotions.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.280]   He calls it scientific study. He is wrong in his description. He is referring to Freudianism,
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:51.520]   the Freudian view of men, the study of all these things that govern and control our desires and
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.880]   our activities. He is referring to psychoanalysis and things like that. And he says, "This is
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:03.840]   beginning to explain, among other things, why our propensity for destructiveness is as great
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:11.360]   as the pessimism of theology had imagined it to be." You see, this man is saying that Freud,
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.480]   in a sense, has proved that the theologians were right, that Christian doctrine has always been
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:23.120]   right in its pessimistic view of men. But these people don't learn that even yet. They can't see
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.680]   it. The two world wars haven't convinced them. They say, "We don't need your doctrine. We simply
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:36.400]   need to be ethically instructive." So we reject it for that reason. They don't realize the depth
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   of sin in fallen human nature. In the same way, they don't realize how these things
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:50.640]   are harmful to the soul. They never talk much about the soul. They never realize with the
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:56.880]   apostle Peter that we must say something like this, "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:07.840]   and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." The soul? You don't hear
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:13.760]   them talking about the soul. But these things, they war against the soul. That's why I mustn't
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.760]   do them. But they don't give me this encouragement. They don't tell me about the soul, or in the words
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.800]   of our blessed Lord himself, "What shall it profit a man, though he gain the whole world,
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   and lose his own soul?" They don't speak like that. This is teaching, you see. This is doctrine.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.600]   This implies the fall, and things like that, and the condition of men as he is in this fallen
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:43.840]   condition. And then over and above all this, the notion of judgment and everlasting and eternal
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.640]   destiny. They deny that. This is what the Bishop of Woolwich won't have. This is what he says you
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:53.200]   mustn't believe. It's even doubtful whether God is personal at all. He's simply the ground of
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   being, says Tillich, and there's no such thing as a final judgment. And so the modern man says,
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:05.760]   "Well, then it doesn't matter very much what I do." Yes, says Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 again,
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:11.600]   "If Christ be not risen from the dead, if man doesn't rise, if there isn't a judgment,
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.680]   let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die." And that's what people are doing.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:21.120]   Because they've denied the doctrine, they're ignoring the way of life. They haven't a reason
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:30.960]   for living it. And then, you see, they exclude altogether the doctrine of the rebirth. Did you
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:36.160]   notice that great argument that I read to you at the beginning out of Paul's epistle to the
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:43.120]   Ephesians? "You mustn't walk any longer as the other Gentiles walk," he says. "Don't you realize
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.360]   you were God's dear children? You've been born again. You were sometimes darkness,
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.640]   but now you're light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light." There's no such argument. Why?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.160]   They don't believe the doctrine of the rebirth and regeneration. They don't want doctrine.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.000]   They don't want the apostle's teaching. They only want ethical instruction. And thus,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.560]   they exclude the most powerful arguments for ethical, moral living.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.160]   And they entirely exclude the great argument that is based upon the need of our preparing ourselves
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:24.160]   for the glory that awaits us. The apostle John, believing all the apostolic doctrine,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.320]   says, "Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.760]   But this we know, that when he appears, we shall see him as he is, and we shall be like him."
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:41.520]   And then he says, "Every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure."
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.960]   They reject that. That's doctrine. That's Christian teaching. That's apostolic doctrine.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.720]   It's gone. My motives for holy living are taken away from me.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:45:01.280]   And they take from me the greatest argument of all. What's that? The greatest argument I know
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:10.800]   tonight for holy, ethical, moral living is this, my gratitude to the Son of God who loved me and
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:18.320]   gave himself for me. Let Isaac Watts put the argument for us. "When I survey the wondrous
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:26.560]   cross on which the Prince of Glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and poor contempt
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:34.720]   on all my pride." Then on he goes. He describes the agony and the blood flowing down, and then he
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:46.080]   ends by saying, "Did e'er such love and sorrow meet or thorns compare so rich a crown?" Here's
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:56.640]   the argument. "Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were an offering far too small, love so
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:05.840]   amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all." But they've excluded it. They don't want
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.320]   teaching. They don't want apostolic doctrine. This is no good. The modern man can't take this.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.440]   All we need is ethical instruction. You see, not only do they give me no standard for my living,
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:25.040]   they give me no reason for living it. Lastly, and most practical of all,
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:31.280]   they have no power to offer me which will enable me to live it.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:39.040]   Let's take them on their own showing. They praise the Sermon on the Mount, Christ's ethical,
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:46.160]   moral teaching. They say, "There it is, that is the life you're to live." And as this man puts it
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:54.320]   in his booklet, not so much a creed, more a way of life, he says, "You can only appeal and exhort
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:59.840]   and show example." What's it mean? Good advice. Cut his good advice and use it to us.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.960]   What would be your position tonight if I had nothing to say to you except this?
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.920]   That you are to give up sinning, that you are to live a good life,
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:19.360]   and just left you at that? Is it easy to live a good life? Is it easy to resist temptation and
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:25.680]   sin? You see, these people, they talk beautifully, they write very well, but they give me no power,
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.880]   they give me no help, they leave me. There's the standard. I'm left to live it, imitated Christ.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:40.320]   How can I? No, no, it's all useless, it's all futile. Why? Oh, these men, they know nothing
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.600]   about the power of the devil and the power of evil. Ah, but that's Christian doctrine,
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.640]   that's apostolic doctrine. The modern man, he can't possibly believe in the devil. The apostles
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.040]   believed in the devil, of course, but they lived 1,900 years ago. We are modern men, we know
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.400]   biology, we know geology, we don't believe in the devil, don't you? Well then, in the name of God,
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:09.120]   I ask you, explain your world. Freud goes a good way, but he doesn't go far enough.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:16.960]   The devil says there's only one explanation of the state of the world,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.400]   and that is the power of the devil and the power of evil.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:28.480]   These men don't know life, they don't know themselves. Why is the world as it is? It's
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.680]   the power of the devil. We are under the dominion of Satan. The God of this world
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:40.560]   hath blinded the minds of them that believe not. It is slavery, it is bondage. The world isn't free.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:48.960]   Behind all these things that psychoanalysis may reveal is a malign power, the prince of the power
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.560]   of the air, the spirit that now dwelleth in the children of disobedience, as Paul describes him
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:00.320]   in Ephesians 2. This is at the back of it all, and when you realize that that's the power,
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:08.960]   what's the use of good advice? The devil defeated every one of the greatest saints of the Old
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:15.600]   Testament, every one of them, they were all defeated. He not only defeated men, the first
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.040]   men, Adam and Eve, when they were perfect, he has defeated all their progeny, the greatest included.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:27.600]   So what's the value of good advice when you're fighting the devil?
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:36.640]   And then consider the nature of fallen men, or if you like, fallen human nature. Oh,
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.080]   how superficial all this writing is. Why don't these men examine themselves? Why don't they
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.960]   stand before a moral mirror? Why don't they listen to their own imaginations and thoughts?
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.640]   Why don't they face it? If they did, they'd begin to say things like this with David.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:57.760]   "In sin did my mother conceive me."
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:08.720]   "Oh," he says, "creating me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.400]   "My trouble," says David, "is not that I do an occasional thing that is wrong."
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.440]   "It's not that I committed adultery and then murder on top of it."
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.000]   "The thing that worries me is that I haven't wanted to."
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.040]   "My heart is unclean. It's vile." "I'm rotten. Wash me with hyssop."
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.960]   "I need to be cleansed." That's understanding.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:32.240]   Or if you prefer it, take the words of our Lord himself. He says,
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.480]   "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world."
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:42.080]   "But men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil."
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.720]   Oh, that's the trouble. It isn't light we need. It's a nature that can love it and
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.040]   hate the darkness instead of vice versa.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:56.320]   Or again, take the words of our Lord to these Jews to whom he promised to set free.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:02.800]   "They turned and replied, saying, 'We be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any men.'"
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.120]   "How sayest thou he shall be made free?"
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:11.280]   "Jesus answered them, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committeth sin
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:18.160]   is the servant of sin, and the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the son abideth ever.'"
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:26.400]   My dear friends, we're all slaves. Slave to sin and evil. Thought, imaginations, actions.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:33.120]   Oh, take that supreme bit of autobiography given us by the Apostle Paul in Romans 7.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:39.440]   Here's honesty for you. Here's a man facing the facts, not simply writing a beautiful article.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:48.800]   "He says, 'That which I do I allow not; for what I do not, what I would not, that do I; but what I
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:57.600]   hate, that do I.' I know, he says, that in me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing,
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:03.680]   for the well is present with me. But how to perform that which is good, I find not; for the
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.120]   good that I would, I do not; but the evil, which I would not, that I do. Now if I do that, I would
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.120]   not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law that when good
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.960]   is present with, when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:26.720]   after the inward men, but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.960]   and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched men that I am,
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:41.760]   who shall deliver me! They know nothing about that. That's doctrine, you see. That's apostolic
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:47.920]   doctrine. That's the doctrine of man's fall. That's the doctrine of man in sin and evil.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:53.120]   They don't believe it. And then add to that man's inability. You put the program before him,
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.800]   but the answer in the Old Testament is this. Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:07.760]   spots? Listen to Solomon writing in the book of Ecclesiastes, these great wise men, worldly men
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:14.000]   with great experience. He says, I've come to this conclusion, that which is crooked cannot be made
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:22.080]   straight. It can't be done. Education can't straighten a man. Can it? Read the proceedings
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.760]   of the police courts and the divorce courts, and of any other court you like. No, no, that which
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.320]   is crooked cannot be made straight. It's like you're telling us we can't. We are unable.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:39.520]   Very well, my friends, I don't know what you feel, but what I feel like saying is this.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:49.200]   Thank God for apostolic doctrine. Thank God for this teaching that the first Christians coveted
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:57.120]   and desired to be built up in. What is it? Oh, here it is. I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:05.200]   Christ. Why not? Well, because it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth,
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:12.240]   to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. What is this doctrine? Here's the apostolic teaching,
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   for which I thank God. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:26.480]   law of sin and death, for what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh. God,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:33.840]   sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemns sin in the flesh,
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.560]   that the righteousness of God might be revealed and fulfilled in us,
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.920]   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. What's it mean? It means this,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:53.120]   that man is as he is because he is a rebel against God and has become an enemy of God.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:00.960]   The carnal mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God,
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:06.800]   neither indeed can be, and therefore there is only hope for men when he gets right with God.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.600]   How can I get right with God? I've sinned against him. I've broken his laws. I've defied him. I've
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.800]   laughed at him. I've ridiculed him. I've denied him as a person. I've said he's only the ground
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:22.320]   of being. He's only goodness or he's only love. How can I be reconciled? There's only one answer.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:32.160]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:37.280]   He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:48.160]   Why did he do that, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him? This is the only
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:54.640]   hope, my dear friends, this gospel, this apostolic teaching, preaching Christ, Son of God,
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.840]   crucified for our sins, buried, risen the third day, ascending to heaven,
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:05.040]   seated at the right hand of God, sending down the Holy Spirit. It's the only hope.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:11.760]   How is it the only hope? Well, you see, this
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.800]   deals with our sins, and Christ has borne the punishment, and we are forgiven.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:25.760]   We are given a new heart, a new nature. We become the children of God. We have
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:32.160]   new life within us. We now have a nature that loves the light and hates the darkness.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:39.760]   Instead of loving the darkness and hating the light, we've got the power of the Spirit of God
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:45.680]   within us. We've got a Christ who says, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee." There is a
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:52.080]   power in us, the power of God. Listen to Paul putting it to the Corinthians in these tremendous
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:58.480]   words. Listen to the moral problem in Corinth. He says, "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:05.920]   not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:12.720]   nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:21.680]   nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you,
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:32.640]   but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:40.400]   and by the Spirit of our God." In other words, it comes to what our Lord himself had said to
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:49.040]   those Pharisees, "If the Son shall set you free, you shall be free indeed." "You," says Paul to
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:56.000]   the Romans, "were the servants, the slaves of sin, but ye have believed from the heart,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.800]   ye have obeyed from the heart that form of sound doctrine that was delivered unto you."
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:10.880]   That's the only thing that works, because it is the only thing that gives me any power.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:17.200]   The problem of men is not to know what's right, it is the problem of being able to do it.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:22.880]   "To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I know not." "Ah," says this
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.120]   man, "there is still some hope for the Christian church. Of course, the doctrines are of no value.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.680]   There is still some purpose, some function. She can still teach Christ's ethical teaching
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:38.160]   and exhort us to practice it." God have mercy upon us. We are all doomed,
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:43.360]   we are all damned if that's the case. But thank God it isn't the case.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:56.640]   He breaks the power of cancelled sin. He sets the prisoner free. His blood can make the foulest
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:07.840]   clean. "His blood availed for me." Have you believed on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:16.160]   God and the Savior of your soul? And have you handed yourself just as you are to Him,
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:24.800]   to be led to be saved by Him? Amen.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:30.480]   - We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
