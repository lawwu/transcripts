[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   Everyone knows about Pompeii, but there was another nearby town called Herculaneum.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.040]   And in Herculaneum, there was one villa in particular,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.720]   and it had once been owned by the father-in-law of Julius Caesar.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.360]   When Vesuvius erupted, those towns were buried and forgotten.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.360]   And so in 1750, a farm worker who was digging a well
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.160]   struck this marble paving stone, and they found all these treasures.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.760]   But it was also the home to a huge library of papyrus scrolls.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.040]   The current situation is we have 600+ kind of roughly intact scrolls that we can't open.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   It's estimated that if we could read all of them,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.760]   that would give us approximately doubling in the total ancient Roman or Greek text.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.480]   It would be like, no, we get all of the text that we have again.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.640]   I read about a professor who had been trying to scan these
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.360]   using increasingly advanced imaging techniques
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.840]   to kind of virtually unroll them without ever opening them.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.800]   We got to talking and decided to team up
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.320]   to launch a million dollar competition to decode the scrolls.
