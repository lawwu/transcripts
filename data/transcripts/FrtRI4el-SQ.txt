[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   So there's a bunch of products, services, and companies that I work with on the business side.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.880]   For all of our banking, I think my favorite picks are Brex and Mercury.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.560]   For our amazing third member of our team, we worked with Oceans, which is a staffing agency,
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.920]   and that's how we found Possany, who is the most incredible.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.680]   Started out as an assistant, but has now grown into so much more,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.080]   pretty much a chief of staff, making sure everything's running.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520]   Big shout out to Oceans.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.400]   If you want to explore delegation and hiring an assistant, check out the delegation guide.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.000]   For taxes, you know, I mentioned Gelt for personal, we use them for business as well.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We use QuickBooks Forever, which I hated,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.200]   and we finally just switched to an awesome new bookkeeping software called Kik, kik.co.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.920]   We do a lot of our payment processing and invoicing on Stripe.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.160]   We send all of our emails through ConvertKit.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.840]   We run all of our email addresses on Google Apps.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.600]   We run the whole podcast, and I actually run most of my life in Notion.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.640]   Probably deserve to be mentioned outside of the business section.
