[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   One of those things that typically give me a lot of analysis paralysis back when I started
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.960]   was this little phrase in the listing that says, "As-is,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.320]   seller not willing to make any repairs to the property."
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.240]   And so that held me back from ever buying properties or ever making offers until I figured
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.080]   out that that really doesn't mean anything. Because what's happened for me 100% of the time
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.080]   is I'll make the offer on an "as-is house" and then I get the inspection report and guess what?
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.520]   I asked the seller for $10,000 worth of repairs or a $2,000 credit or whatever.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.040]   Just because something says "as-is" doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take that
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.520]   face value. And that's something that I think a lot of people miss
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.160]   when they're buying their first or second or third property.
