[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   - Hey Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   host of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   here today with you to do another book review.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And the book of the day is How to Make People Like You
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   by Nicholas Boothman.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   How to Make People Like You by Nicholas Boothman.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Just finished this book last week and really enjoyed it.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I give it a four star, really well written book,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   really useful content.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I think this is a fundamental life skill
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and this is well worth reading.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   If you've never read a book on how to build rapport,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   how to connect with people,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   this would be a good one to start with.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And I think that all young people should be forced
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   to read books like this.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   In the same, you know, a lot of these books,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   they build on a lot of the research that's gone on
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   for a long time.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   A more foundational book would be
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   How to Win Friends and Influence People.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   But what I loved about this book is it's much more tactical
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   than How to Win Friends and Influence People.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   was very over-arching and useful.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   But this book gives some very specific,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   very useful tactics.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It gives a game plan.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So if you're training somebody on how to do something,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   then they need to know some specific tactics.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And this book gives those tactics.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It specifically gives you a series of steps
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   for you to follow when first meeting somebody
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   so that they like you in 90 seconds or less.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now, self-help book titles often tend to sound
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   a little bit shmarmy.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   They sound a little bit over the top.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   sounds a little bit--
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   sounds like kind of a big promise.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I think the book does a good job, though,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   of actually delivering on that.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And those types of titles make a book stand out
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   on the bookshelf to make you pick it up.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   But there's nothing unethical about these tools and techniques.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   They're as simple as adopting a useful attitude
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   towards somebody, making sure that you send them
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   the type of positive energy that you want them to have,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   mirroring them and establishing rapport,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and asking them open-ended questions
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   to get to know who they are.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Those are tactics and techniques that all of us
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   should be employing on a daily basis.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So a really useful introduction to the subject.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I listen to the audiobook version.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm buying the paperback version
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   because this is one of those books that I want to have
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   on my shelf as a reference book.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And once a year or so, I'll pick it up, flip through it,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   spend a week or two intentionally practicing
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   every time I meet somebody just to make sure
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   that I'm constantly improving and maintaining
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   my skills in that department.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I don't know that I'll listen to the audiobook version again,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   although I haven't bought it yet.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I got the audiobook on this one from my library.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I actually probably would, maybe once a year or so,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   listen back to the audiobook version again.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And then definitely I want to have the paperback, though,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   so I can just flip through the outline really quick.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So that's the book, four stars, really enjoyed it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   If you've never read a book on the subject,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   definitely get this one.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Even if you have read a book on the subject,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   if it's been a while since you've talked about rapport
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and charisma, developing that ability to make people like you,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   this would be a good one for a review.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So that's the book.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It looks like this, How to Make People Like You
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   in 90 Seconds or Less by Nicholas Boothman.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Check it out.
