[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So there's this idea on the populist right that we tried libertarianism and now wokeness
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   has taken over.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   And I'm like, okay, when did Republicans repeal the Civil Rights Act?
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.560]   When did that happen?
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.120]   When did they defund public education?
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.640]   No, you actually haven't done anything close to libertarianism and now you're making libertarianism
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.040]   the scapegoat for all these negative trends.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.560]   Today I'm speaking with Richard Hanania, who is the president of the Center for the Study
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.560]   of Partisanship and Ideology and the author of the new book, Public Choice Theory and
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.320]   the Illusion of Grand Strategy.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.960]   So Richard, first, can you just summarize the book briefly before we get into questions?
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   Sure.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.240]   So the argument of my book is it has two real audiences.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   So first, people who study international relations, political scientists, there's something in
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   there for them.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.560]   And there's also, I think, something in there for people who are just interested in American
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.920]   foreign policy more generally.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.760]   So the way that academics tend to study foreign policy, and this is a simplification, but
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.600]   if you're going to have to generalize about the way it's understood in political science,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.280]   the field of international relations, the idea is that states basically are rational
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.280]   actors.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.240]   And rational actors doesn't mean what they do is necessarily good for the world or whether
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.120]   their values are consistent with other people's values, but basically that states seek certain
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.720]   goals and their behavior can be understood in that context.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.920]   So basically, the study of grand strategy is a corollary of this, and the idea is that
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.080]   diplomatic, economic, and military means tend to be put towards the same goals.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.800]   They're all basically moving in the same direction.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.080]   And I think this view of understanding foreign policy is sort of naive.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.360]   My main argument is that we don't think like this in terms of domestic policy.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.200]   We don't think that there's a grand strategy of the US government with regards to immigration,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.780]   with regards to healthcare, with regards to tax system.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:06.560]   There's a fallacy of seeing a design in international relations or a kind of goal-focused behavior.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.880]   And we tend not to make that mistake in other areas.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.320]   So the first two chapters are basically the theoretical case for why a lot of the ways
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.680]   we look at international relations is wrong, that people are interested in academic works,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.560]   they're interested in sort of thinking about ideas and political philosophy.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.720]   I think people will enjoy those chapters.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.240]   And then most of the rest of the book is basically looking at American foreign policy and asking,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.600]   does a theory of grand strategy or a theory based on public choice, which I present as
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.480]   an alternative model, does that explain things like when the US troop presence is abroad,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.240]   when we start and end various wars, the American sanctions regime, so major parts of American
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   foreign policy.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.360]   And I argue that the public choice model of foreign policy just works better.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   So maybe the unitary actor model is not right right now, but wouldn't be true in the future.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.240]   So the countries that have a fucked up foreign policy where the whole thing is in shambles
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.760]   and contradicts itself, they'll lose out to the countries that actually have a cohesive
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.080]   national strategy.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.240]   And in the long run, the countries that actually do have a grand strategy will win, right?
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.060]   So this is actually one of the arguments for how you get rationality that I take issue
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.060]   with.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.440]   I think this is most closely associated with international relations theorist Kenneth Waltz.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.840]   So there's a few things you can say about this, right?
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.040]   It might just go against the nature of the state, right?
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.600]   Maybe the state is such a big and complicated thing that maybe you get closer to rationality,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.280]   you get closer to grand strategies through a sort of a selection process, but it's still
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.640]   an open question how close you get.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.080]   And the other thing is I would say that there's a lot else going on in the world beyond how
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.780]   states react to one another.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.940]   So the origins of economic development are a complicated thing, and a country like the
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.420]   United States can have a lot going for it as far as human capital, as far as institutions,
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.780]   and do very well economically, and it can afford to have a sort of irrational foreign
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.780]   policy.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.780]   There's actually one possibility, is that states that tend to have good institutions
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.660]   for economic growth, things like decentralization, individual freedom, and open society, that
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.380]   might be bad for forming a grand strategy for international relations because you can
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.500]   have interest groups influence foreign policy, and people are worried about their own lives
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.460]   rather than what's going on abroad, and the state is limited and can't really enforce
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   its will.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.180]   So this is a possibility that nobody's brought up before, but perhaps there is some kind
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.620]   of tension there where states with bad foreign policies will tend to have good economic growth
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.940]   and therefore a lot of geopolitical strength.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.940]   Interesting.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.940]   So is it one way to read your book that maybe the decline of war has been bad, right?
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.540]   Because when you had war, you had casualties and everything, that's bad.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.460]   But at least you had to keep countries on their toes and their political institutions
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.940]   couldn't become all messed up.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.260]   So is one way to read your book that the political institutions in our world have become so sclerotic
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.980]   because there isn't enough war?
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.860]   So you know, war is on balance bad, but are there good things we can say for war as far
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.500]   as historical development goes?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.460]   I think that depending on your politics, if you look at World War I and World War II,
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.860]   a lot happened for the expansion of the American federal government, and I think that's mostly
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.700]   been bad, but if somebody thinks that's good, if you're a big supporter of the welfare
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.180]   state and sort of the centralization of power in Washington, you have to credit World War
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.180]   I and World War II.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.100]   I think that's clear from the historical record.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.420]   So unquestionably, war leads to changes.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.620]   The potential for war probably was part of the Cold War and eventually the Soviet Union
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.620]   collapsed.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.260]   If there was no potential for any kind of conflict there, who knows, maybe the Soviet
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.620]   Union could have existed forever.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.900]   So unquestionably, war is an accelerant and a sort of catalyst for change, and if you
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.620]   think we need a lot of change, maybe you might distress seeing the decline of war over time,
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.660]   but change can also go in a negative direction too.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.420]   Now, to what extent are these problems unique to democracy?
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.580]   So if you have concentrated interest, being able to pull a government to do counterproductive
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.620]   things, because if you look at the quote-unquote China's grand strategy, right, it's a very
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.620]   centralized system.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.700]   China's the wrong guy at the top, but they're doing some very stupid things, like they're
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.100]   fighting over some irrelevant islands with Japan, they're getting into skirmishes with
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.980]   India over some mountain regions, and we'll see about the Belt and Road, but right now
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.500]   it seems like there's some place, you wouldn't have known more about this than me, but there
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.100]   seems like there's some places where there's cost overruns and where they're building stuff
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.060]   in places that are irrelevant.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.660]   So to what extent are centralized governments able to have a better grand strategy?
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.620]   So yeah, we should be careful not to say, you know, having a grand strategy is better
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.780]   or smarter in some ways, just the question that I address in the book is whether it's
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.280]   coherent.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.580]   Whether China, so we can understand China in comparison to the US on these two axes,
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.620]   whether it's smart or wise, versus whether it's coherent.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.620]   Whether it's smart or wise, which I think your question was getting at, I mean, China's
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:38.540]   blunders in having squabbles with Japan over a few islands, I mean, if you compare that
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.620]   to the US investment in Afghanistan or Iraq, I mean, there's really, you know, we're not
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.620]   really ones to talk about, you know, foreign policy blunders.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.900]   I mean, the Chinese, even spending on the military is pretty low, I mean, there's nothing
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.300]   that compares to Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, I mean, so we have blunder after blunder.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.820]   And whether the Chinese system has more coherence in foreign policy, and whether that could
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:08.580]   be attributed to it not being a democracy, I think that's right.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.660]   I mean, I think that the fact that the Chinese basically, China's grand strategy has been
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.540]   not to have much of a foreign policy, I mean, relative to the US, you know, not to take
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.020]   much, you know, not to care much about what goes on in most of the world.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.020]   And then, you know, there does seem to be a concerted effort to sort of push outward
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.780]   and push its way around within its region, which is natural, which is what states do
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.300]   as they tend to grow.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.740]   And so, you know, when I look at Chinese foreign policy, do I see more coherence than American?
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.220]   Yes, I mean, you don't see, you know, you see China basically inflict the punishment
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.340]   of a nation, and there is usually a goal, right, and then you can usually, you know,
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.060]   so for example, Lithuania, I think just, I don't know if they recognize Taiwan, or they
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.620]   did something with Taiwan, China didn't like it, so China did something against Lithuania.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.500]   I don't know if Lithuania has like responded or whatever, but basically, I mean, you can
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.100]   understand how this makes sense, right?
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.180]   In the US section, somebody basically says, we're not going to recognize this government,
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.180]   it destroys the economy, it's more total than anything China does, and then it never talks
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.180]   to them again.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.780]   And, you know, that's basically the end of it.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.700]   So yeah, I mean, there's certainly more coherence and I think more sense to what China is doing
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.140]   than what the US is doing.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.660]   But to what extent is that just because, you know, China isn't powerful enough or doesn't
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.540]   have enough money to waste on debacles like Afghanistan and Iraq?
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.100]   So like, maybe in like 30 years when, or not even 30 years, but like, once their economy
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.820]   is bigger than ours, right, will they be making the same kinds of mistakes?
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.260]   I mean, if you look at when was the British Empire most overextended, you know, the peak
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260]   of colonization was when they weren't fully a democracy, right?
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.980]   Yes, I mean, so countries, even without a lot of resources, can often put a lot of efforts
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.980]   overseas.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:49.140]   So Maoist China, I think was one of the, you know, at least for its per capita level was
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.340]   the biggest provider of foreign aid in the world, by far it was giving guys money for
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.180]   like subsidies in Eastern Europe for countries that were richer than itself.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.980]   So Maoist China was extremely poor and had an extremely interventionist foreign policy
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.460]   that it invested a lot in.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:09.780]   Russia today over invests in foreign policy, you know, relative to its economic size.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:15.580]   So you know, it's, you know, the US certainly can't afford to do more than China in my PPP
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.580]   terms.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.060]   I mean, China has, has caught up or passed the United States.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:24.020]   So China, I mean, has the potential to do a lot more, I just think it chooses not to.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.020]   Right.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.260]   Now, you say in the book that the public doesn't really care about that much about foreign
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260]   policy, at least in comparison to domestic policy.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.780]   Does that mean that if the president actually did have a coherent vision of a grand strategy,
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.660]   he could enact it because like the public is just not going to be paying attention and
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.780]   if he just like really wants something, he could do it?
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.140]   I think it depends on the, you know, the costs of what the grand strategy are.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.180]   The grand strategy involves sending a lot of troops abroad and taking a lot of casualties.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.140]   That's going to be really hard.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.940]   If the, you know, if, if it's more along the lines of we're going to crush one nation,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.980]   you know, and you know, how we define grand strategy, there's grand strategy at the macro
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.980]   level.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.660]   And then there's sort of at the, we can think about them as like, you know, approach to
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.660]   one country.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.500]   And sometimes we do see that, like, I think the, the last administration had a defacto
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:16.320]   basically, not a defacto, more than a defacto, sort of an intended policy of regime change
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   towards Iran.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.900]   And that wasn't, they weren't open about that.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.580]   But the idea was basically you just, you know, you just sanction them as much as possible
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.940]   and you just hope, you know, that they're as less powerful as possible and potentially
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.940]   collapse.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.340]   And there was a more official strategy of regime change and they even recognized a different
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.620]   government in Venezuela.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.980]   So, and you know, that didn't require any American casualties, it required a lot of
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.660]   suffering in the countries that were, that were targeted.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.900]   But at this stage that the American efforts were put towards certain goals.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.980]   So yes, you're right, within certain limits, presidents do have freedom to do a lot and
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.780]   people don't care about Iran and they don't care about Venezuela.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.180]   So there was a lot of, yeah, there was a lot of freedom there.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.180]   Okay.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.180]   Now you say sanctions don't work.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.180]   Intervention doesn't work.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.420]   But if you look at a country like North Korea, we feel like, you know, if there was something
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.060]   we really ought to be able to, we really ought to do it, like we really don't want them to
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.700]   have nukes or the capacity to launch nukes to the United States.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.660]   So if these traditional interventions don't work, is there something you could do about
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.180]   a country like North Korea or like, you know, Venezuela is like starving its own people.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.900]   Obviously the sanctions are making it worse, but like if you wanted to, you know, get rid
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.740]   of Maduro, is there something we could do that is like feasible and it's not counterproductive?
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.860]   So I mean, each of these cases is, is sort of unique.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.820]   So I mean, North Korea, I mean, interventions work, I mean, if, you know, if you just overthrow
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.700]   a government, you can get rid of them.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.780]   The, you know, but obviously that would be very costly in the case of North Korea for
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:45.540]   nuclear weapons and even conventional weapons, they have a lot of, you know, a pretty big
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.540]   army.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.860]   Can we do something about North Korean, you know, nukes?
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:56.260]   I think, you know, one school of thought is basically that, that North Korea wants nukes
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.140]   because it's afraid of the U.S., right?
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.140]   It's basically defensive.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.980]   It thinks that the U.S., if not, if it's not going to invade it at this point, it's because
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.980]   of nukes.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:11.120]   It would like to see the regime fall anyway and that's probably, that's probably true.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:17.540]   And you know, and the question is, do you, you know, and the question is, do you accommodate
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.500]   sort of that fear if what you're worried about is nuclear weapons and you learn to live with
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   the government?
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.020]   Now there's another school of thought on North Korea that says basically they want the U.S.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.940]   out and they want to, they want to conquer the South.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.140]   You know, I don't have insight into, you know, the thinking of the North Korean regime, so
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.500]   it's really hard to say which is the, you know, which is the correct position.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:42.460]   And then on Venezuela, like, is there something we can do to, you know, counteract the, you
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.340]   know, the terrible economic policies that the Maduro regime, you know, and before the
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.740]   Chavez regime have implemented?
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.020]   You know, it's very, very hard.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:14:00.220]   I mean, the, I think the, the move towards more open markets globally has been, has been
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.780]   the result of basically people seeing that markets work much better than central planning.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.500]   I mean, the Soviet Union, the elites in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe realized that
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.820]   what they were doing was not working and they basically, they moved to a capitalist system.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.220]   It wasn't because Gorbachev, you know, wasn't forced into it.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.060]   There were, there was nothing, there was no, like, rebellion from below or civil war or
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.060]   anything.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.960]   It was simply the society that the regime had lost legitimacy, even if not from the
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.900]   people, at least from the, you know, from those at the top and for the, especially for
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.680]   the Soviet satellites.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.780]   And so that doesn't mean that, that movement's going to be, you know, the movement is going
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.860]   to be consistent in the direction of, you know, markets all the time everywhere.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.580]   So you have to understand sometimes some places are going to go in the opposite direction.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.180]   I think about, you know, one thing the U.S., you know, the U.S. does have, do some very
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.260]   harmful things to Latin America that I think they probably shouldn't do.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.140]   I mean, the drug war, I mean, these countries, so much of their politics revolves around
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.620]   stopping the flow of drugs and because that's what the U.S. demands and like, you know,
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.620]   who cares about drugs?
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.860]   Is that worth having a civil war over?
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.860]   No, of course not.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.620]   And, you know, Mexico and these other countries in Latin America would probably be much better
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.460]   off if we didn't, if we didn't do that.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.620]   I think that there's also a sense, a lot of U.S. meddling as far as, like, democratization
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.660]   and human rights, which people think these are generally good things and all else being
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.220]   equal, they might be good things.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.980]   But we are not in a position to know, you know, like if you're a country that has a
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.060]   serious violence problem, right, and that's like, you know, the first, you know, that's
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.420]   the prerequisite to everything else, to peaceful living, to growth, everything is getting violence
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.980]   under control and Latin Americans have really bad problems with it.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.340]   And then somebody comes from abroad and says, you know, you have to fight crime or you have
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.420]   to fight cartels in a way consistent with our human rights norms, you know, that's something
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.680]   that sounds good, but might not actually, you know, might not actually be conducive
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.460]   to getting the best possible policy at the local level.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.780]   So I think there's a lot of meddling and sort of hubris about what we know and what's best
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.780]   for these countries.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.380]   And I think that moving away from that would probably help them solve their problems in
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.380]   their own way.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.140]   Now, you say in the book that one of the agents that are influencing American foreign policy
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.580]   are foreign governments like Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.860]   But if they are able to actually influence American policy in a way that is good for
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.340]   them as a nation, doesn't that make these countries rational actors then that have a
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.700]   cohesive grant strategy?
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.100]   I mean, so, so something I don't go into the book is, and well, I mean, you have just talked
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.340]   about it now, sort of what countries, when countries have, you know, can act like more
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.420]   like unitary actors and when they don't.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.620]   And in the case of, I think, I think that one of the determinants of whether a country
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.220]   acts with, you know, a strategy in a certain domain is how important the issue is to them,
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.220]   right?
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:46.300]   I mean, Iran is much more important to Israel and Saudi Arabia than it is to America, right,
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.260]   by many, many times.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.740]   And so you can imagine Israel and Saudi Arabia do have something resembling a strategy when
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.740]   it comes to Iran.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:17:00.460]   And the US has a sort of open political system and is liable to be influenced by those countries.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.140]   And often it's not even, you know, you know, it's you could even, you know, question whether
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.860]   it's always those countries or it's a faction within those countries.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:13.820]   But yeah, I do take the point that, you know, often there's something closer to a strategy
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.460]   in what other countries are doing, just because they're closer to the problem and it actually
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.860]   just matters a lot more to them.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.060]   And in the book, you say that when it comes to foreign policy, special interests matter
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.300]   more than ideas.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.220]   And then ideas are, after the fact, justifications for what these special interests want.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.780]   But when you talk about domestic policy, you seem to be making the opposite point that
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.860]   actually it's the ideology that matters more and then economic self-interest actually determines
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.140]   very little about people's political preferences.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.300]   So why is there a difference between foreign policy and domestic policy?
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.860]   So that, I mean, so my view on domestic policy, I mean, so there's, you know, the level of
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:53.020]   the voter, there's, there's, I think, very little in terms of objective interest because
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.860]   the voter doesn't have a stake in, you know, a stake in their vote doesn't determine the
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.240]   outcome of the election.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.880]   So one of the consistent findings of political science is basically that people's economic
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.040]   circumstances do a very, very poor job of predicting their, their political orientation.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   So whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or whatever, your, your economic situation
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.200]   is not very predictive, you know, not even close compared to demographic factors and,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.240]   you know, cultural attitudes and, and things like that.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.320]   Now, when it comes to policy, you know, there's, I think there's a, you know, there's a few
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   different kinds of policy.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.760]   So the most things there is, you know, the public opinion is just not paying attention
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.760]   to it.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.440]   This public opinion have a really strong view on the nature of the tax code or, or, you
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.960]   know, the exact details of environmental regulations or, you know, whatever, I mean, the same thing
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.000]   in foreign policy with, you know, something like NATO expansion, the, you know, so I think
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.280]   this is basically, you know, both international and domestic, international relations and
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:56.080]   domestic politics, the, the interest groups, you know, have a, have a huge role to play.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.980]   Now, the, when it comes to certain issues that are particularly salient.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.640]   So in the domestic context, this is something like social security, like people aren't going
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.320]   to notice, like if you cut their social security benefits or the Medicare or, or something
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.960]   like that, you know, there's not a lot of taxes, you know, same thing.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.220]   There's not a lot of issues that are exactly like this.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.560]   But here public opinion matters and here you have to, you have to tread carefully if you're
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.680]   a politician and it's the same thing in foreign policy when there's a cost that when you're
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.920]   going to do something that's potentially very costly to the country and it becomes a major
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:33.120]   political issue, then, then it, then public opinion matters a lot more.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.700]   So you needed, you know, public opinion to be on your side to go into Iraq, right?
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.760]   There was overwhelming support for the Iraq war at the time.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.140]   Now one of the unique things I think about foreign policy that makes, gives leaders sort
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.600]   of more freedom of movement compared to domestic politics and if you're going to say, what's
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.840]   the difference in sort of my understanding of politics between domestic issues and international
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.160]   issues, it's probably, this is probably one of the most important.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.720]   It's the, it's the, it's the fact that basically public opinion is more easily manipulated
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.920]   by leaders in foreign, in foreign relations, right?
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.440]   I don't think there's a way to sell, you know, getting rid of social security that's going
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.880]   to work with the American public.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.320]   There is, you could easily sell some country as a threat to the United States because most
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.280]   Americans don't have experience with foreign countries, they don't have independent knowledge.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.200]   You know, these places like Ukraine or Russia or Estonia or anything is basically exists
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.560]   as an abstraction and why we think of one country as a friend and one country as an
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.760]   ally and one country as an enemy, I mean that's basically, that's media coverage, that signal's
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.720]   coming from elites.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.520]   And so it's, you know, you look at like going back to the Iraq, Iraq war, I mean nobody
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.200]   was thinking about attacking Iraq, you know, right after 9/11, but basically the Bush administration
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.840]   had, you know, high approval ratings in the aftermath of the attack.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.480]   There was a full-on basically PR campaign to not explicitly tie Saddam to 9/11, but
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:58.120]   basically tie him to Al-Qaeda, you know, make people be afraid of WMDs, I mean even though
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.200]   the Bush administration never said this, I mean there was a, I think it was a majority
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.400]   or a plurality of the public actually believed Saddam was personally involved in 9/11, you
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.120]   know, which there was never any evidence for, but it was easy to sort of lead people in
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.720]   that direction, just because, you know, who knows anything about Saddam Hussein or Iraq,
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   right?
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.960]   People have to sort of trust their leaders on these things, and maybe that's getting
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.320]   harder as like polarization is more extreme and people don't trust their leaders anymore,
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.960]   but there's still just more room to maneuver on foreign policy than there is on a lot of
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   domestic issues.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.240]   You see in the book Near the End that one of the ways to fix this should be that we
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:39.480]   better regulate a foreign lobbyist in the government and, you know, more funding of,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.360]   you know, let's say defense contractors on to think tanks and research institutions.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.640]   Do you think the same should be true of domestic policy, so we should limit, I mean this is
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.320]   kind of a leftist agenda of limiting how much money there is in politics, or is this unique
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   to foreign policy?
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.040]   So, I mean, I sort of throw those ideas out there as sort of institutional fixes that
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.280]   people can think about.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.400]   I am, you know, I am not, you know, I don't think I come back, come down and say, you
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.360]   know, this is something to fix it, I just think that people should be thinking in terms
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.520]   of institutional changes rather than, you know, arguing, you know, just sort of operating
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.560]   in the realm of ideas.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:23.680]   I think that, yeah, and so, but, you know, I think I probably would support, you know,
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:31.700]   some limits on lobbying for people who worked in the government for, like in the Pentagon.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:38.480]   Does that make, should we do that for all of politics, you know, because I, you know,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.920]   there's not really a, I don't think I have a principled answer here.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.440]   I think that I think that the foreign, you know, the foreign policy, basically the establishment
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.600]   has had a negative influence on American politics and sort of on domestic politics.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.840]   I think the influence of money on politics has been sort of mixed, you know, the idea
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.320]   of campaign finance reform, for example, is you get money out of politics, but if you
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.240]   get money out of politics, who gets the press coverage?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.440]   Well, you know, it's basically the governments and the parties, so it's some other small
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:09.040]   group of people determining sort of the lay of the land and what, you know, what the,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.640]   the lay of the land and what the sort of, what the parameters of the debate are.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:20.160]   I think that, you know, one thing we should do is, I mean, I am, I'm less, less hesitant
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.340]   or less conflicted about endorsing sort of a cultural change.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.960]   So for example, in the areas like, for example, when you, you know, when you're interviewing
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:36.120]   a, a formal general on, you know, in a newspaper or on TV, you don't just say, this is a former
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   general, you say, this guy is also on the board of this corporation or that corporation.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.720]   I mean, that, that I think changes the entire focus of the, you know, of the conversation.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   And that was, the Washington Post wrote a story about this, how basically this is the
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   norm.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.680]   And I, I, I was interviewed for that, for that story.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.720]   I, you know, I think there's no good reason not to do that.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.360]   I think part of my, what my book does, it's not just sort of institutional or legal fixes.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.520]   It's also such as, you know, telling people, think about this in a different way and having
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.120]   sort of this cultural change, which I think takes away a lot of the credibility of the
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.160]   people influencing foreign policy.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   Gotcha.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   Okay.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.360]   So let's talk about experts now.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.200]   So in your article in Tough Talk in Taliban, you point out many ways in which we have established,
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.320]   established fields.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.120]   And if you look at the track record of societal trends associated with those fields, you know,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.760]   things like suicides, when you talk about psychology or crime and you talk about criminology
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.760]   or obviously, you know, Iraq and Afghanistan, we talk about international relations, you
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.560]   know, things have been getting worse.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.640]   But if you're, if that's the standard you're going to apply is how do the societal trends
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.480]   associated with the field do, then you must think that, you know, global poverty research
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.200]   and development economics must be amazing, right?
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.020]   Because we've seen like a billion people lifted out of poverty or more since 1990.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:56.840]   So if you're applying the same standard, then wouldn't, wouldn't it imply that some fields
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.160]   have been doing extraordinarily well?
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.560]   Well, yeah, actually I do think that.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:06.600]   I think, I think that, you know, the reduction in poverty has come from China first and then
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   India.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.200]   And if you ask economists, you know, are Chinese and Indian policies better or worse than they
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.920]   were in the 1960s and 1970s, you could say they're definitely moving in the direction
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.840]   of sort of the consensus of economics.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.900]   So I actually do think economics is a little bit, you know, more of a serious science than
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.240]   other fields.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.960]   And so, yeah, I would agree with that, actually.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.720]   It just looks good in the context of the decline of poverty over time.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.360]   So then would you credit the fact that there hasn't been a nuclear war?
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.760]   Is that, is that something you put in the pro column for international relations?
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.800]   Yeah, that one, you know, I think is, I think is different because we, you know, we, poverty
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   is something we can look at and we can say it's always existed and now it's, you know,
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   it's getting better.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.960]   And so for nuclear weapons, it's not like we had an era of like a lot of nuclear wars
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   and now we don't, right?
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.000]   We had nuclear weapons, they were invented and that's consistent with a story where just
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.520]   these weapons were too horrible for anybody to use.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.160]   But I think if you're going to have like a, you know, a steel man argument of say the
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.400]   case for American empire, it would be something along the lines of, you know, I don't believe
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.560]   that, you know, American hegemony has kept, that is what basically has given us, you know,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.580]   relative peace since 1945.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.600]   But I think it would be a side of a kind of like a Burkean argument that, you know, international
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.120]   system is very complex and it's working out well and just don't change anything, you know,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.640]   too radical because potentially, you know, we do, there's just so much we don't know
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.600]   about what the consequences of that would be.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.840]   Well, how would you respond to that by the way?
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.400]   I would say that, you know, I would say that you have to take different parts of American
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.160]   foreign policy and I would be more sort of open to get rid of, you know, doing away with
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.960]   certain of them than others.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.560]   So for example, regime change wars, that's sanctioned.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.880]   I think those sort of low hanging fruit.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.240]   I don't think that, I don't think you can make the case that, I think you can make the
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.440]   case that these are, you know, these have terrible effects on the world and I don't
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.000]   think you can make the case that they contribute to global order or anything like that.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.240]   You know, overthrowing governments is a huge source of international disorder.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.440]   And then, you know, as far as, you know, whether the, you know, U.S., you know, the sort of
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.520]   U.S. hegemony has been keeping peace, so then you would move on to say the commitments to
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.160]   NATO and, you know, the presence in Japan and South Korea and you would say, okay, you
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.720]   know, we've relative, we've kept the peace, you know, we've kept the peace in a relative
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   way there.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.800]   So it's, you know, I think you have to sort of look, I think that there's a good reason
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.560]   to think that it's not necessarily the influence of the U.S. that's behind the decline of violence
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.720]   because you look at areas, even in countries where it's like, they don't have, you know,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:43.520]   you look at diets where they don't have any relationship with the U.S. on either side,
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.000]   just war is just down basically across the board everywhere.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.920]   And you could say, well, that's all the American system, but I think it's hard to figure out
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:57.280]   exactly how, you know, the U.S. having a presence in East Asia or Eastern Europe, you know,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.800]   that makes Africans stop fighting each other, right?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.200]   And so the fact that everyone basically is not doing war anymore, it just gives you sort
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.680]   of this, I think backs up John Mueller, what John Mueller thinks or what Steven Pinker
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.240]   thinks that's basically, you know, we're in the realm of ideas and people just think war
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   is stupid.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.960]   And from that perspective, you know, the U.S. is sort of an outlier in how much it uses
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.400]   war and then the U.S. is potentially a source of instability, I think I would lean towards
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   that view.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.440]   But yeah, I'll acknowledge that sort of the Burkean view of, you know, things have been
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   working out relatively well, let's not mess with it.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.640]   I mean, another thing that hasn't been working out well actually, the number of being killed
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.320]   in like civil wars and civil conflicts has not gone down the way international war has.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.560]   And if you look at who's behind a lot of the civil wars that have huge death rates, I mean,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   that's the United States.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.160]   So not everything is actually working out well.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.000]   I think keeping order within countries, you mentioned Latin America, a lot of these things
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.720]   are classified as high crime rates, they could theoretically be classified as civil wars.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.000]   And if you think American foreign policy is having a negative effect in Latin America,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.760]   I mean, that's another contributor to the violence abroad.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.120]   So yeah, that, you know, I think that's the response to it.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.640]   But you know, again, I acknowledge there potentially could be something to that argument.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.720]   So I think one of the other things Steven Pinker thinks is behind the decline of violence
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.480]   is also like international alliances like NATO, now to have as a point against that,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.780]   which is that it, you know, while in the short term, it makes us more safe in the long term,
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.680]   you know, you're like, if Russia invades, you know, some North Macedonia or something,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.200]   then we had to go to war, and then it starts World War Three.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.640]   So do you buy Pinker's argument that actually, these American alliances have created a safer
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.640]   world?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.040]   So I haven't, I read Pinker, you know, when it came out, Better Angels of Our Nature about
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.000]   a decade ago, I don't remember him having that argument about NATO.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.520]   I don't recall, but you know, I'll take your word for it.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.520]   I could be wrong.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   I thought it was in Enlightenment Now.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   But yeah.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.520]   Okay.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   So yeah, I also yeah, I also read Enlightenment Now.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.000]   I don't remember, you know, it could be, it could be there or not.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.640]   It's a possible argument, even if it's not Pinker's.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.360]   Okay, yeah, even if it's not Pinker's argument, let's, let's see, I'll just take the argument.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:04.480]   Yeah, so NATO, I mean, the argument for NATO making the world safer, okay, first of all,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.200]   I mean, they during, you know, the justification, you know, I think the justifications for NATO,
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:16.080]   right, originally were there was potentially a Soviet land invasion of Europe, right?
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.160]   And you know, the Soviet Union is gone, right?
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.640]   And so the question is, like, you know, is there a potential for all we're talking about
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   is Russia?
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   I don't know.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   Like, what else would you be talking about?
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   Right?
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   Like that North Africa is going to invade Europe or something.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.160]   It says, you know, the only potentially thing I think we're talking about here is Russia.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.560]   And you know, I, it seems not to I mean, it seems there doesn't seem to be sort of a,
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.360]   you know, there's a capability and there's a question of well, right, Russia is just
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:48.040]   not that, you know, economically positioned to try to take on Germany or France or Western
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:53.000]   Europe, Western Europe, it cares a lot about Ukraine, and it cares a lot about Georgia.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.360]   And you know, I think it's I think it's pretty clear that Russia, you know, the instability
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.560]   is due to Russian fears over the expansion of NATO.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:08.040]   So in Georgia, basically, the government launched a launched a war to try to take back some
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.560]   regions that were that were sort of breakaway regions with alliances towards Russia.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.480]   And the idea was basically they thought the United States had their back and they were
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.240]   trying to settle this issue to get into to get it to NATO.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.560]   There was a great Adam two sub stack on this about the history of Russia and NATO.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.320]   So it's clear that there's this sort of that there's been sort of a destabilizing influence
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:33.040]   Russia's fear that these places would become part of NATO, I think has driven a lot of
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.120]   this sort of behavior abroad.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.160]   I think ultimately, though, I think what it's really about, actually, at its root of like,
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.280]   what where the antagonism comes from, I think that the US sees Russia as a potential for
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   regime change.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.120]   I think it considers the current government illegitimate.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.040]   And I think Russia doesn't, it probably doesn't think that like, the US is going to go into
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.720]   Ukraine and add them to NATO in Georgia, and then like launch an invasion of Russia, you
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.920]   know, that seems very unlikely, I think that the the idea is basically there's an ideological
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.280]   war against the idea of the legitimacy of a Russian state as a non democracy that has
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.320]   a different form of government, different ideological ideas about, you know, just different
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.600]   things than the US does.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.720]   And I think they're responding, they're reacting to that.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.620]   So I think this idea of sort of this idea of regime change is sort of beneath the surface
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.160]   and deriving a lot of attentions.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   Interesting.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.340]   All right, going back to the topic of expertise.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:30.840]   You criticize the focus on peer review, and specialized knowledge, it seems that some
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.600]   fields that seems like a valid criticism, right?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.080]   It seems like there isn't that much specialized knowledge there to begin with.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.480]   But it feels like, let's say particle physics or computational complexity, that seems like
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.760]   academic bureaucracy and incentives have worked and I expect people at the top of that field
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.920]   to be like the best in the world at that, right?
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.840]   So but it seems like the same kind of academic institution, as you know, like a field like
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.540]   international relations, right?
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.480]   So why are they the two different?
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:01.240]   So I think I do say in my expertise, I think I say this, that it's basically, you know,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.320]   I'm focusing on the social sciences, because that's what I know best.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.280]   But you said economics works well, right?
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   Economics works relatively well.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   I think, yeah, I mean, we could talk about why, but that's an interesting question, too.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:20.480]   But, you know, I think so like, Nassim Nicholas Taleb would say that actually, the peer review
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.960]   process doesn't work that well.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.400]   He has some data on like, where the big innovations in science comes from, and he tends to think
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.880]   it comes more from the private sector.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.280]   So I don't know if that's right or wrong to be something, you know, if you look at something
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.680]   like it's complicated, something like the mRNA vaccine, you know, they couldn't get
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:41.440]   the publications, it was based on into peer to the top peer review journals, and then
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.520]   it took, you know, Pfizer and Moderna, you know, it seems like there was, there's a,
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.160]   you know, it seems complicated, because it was didn't belong on some university research
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.080]   in some ways and government funding.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.720]   I think one of the big differences between the social sciences and the hard science,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.880]   I mean, there's a few differences.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.520]   The first one is there is some connection to reality, right?
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.080]   You can design the mRNA vaccine, you can take it out of, you know, you can go, even if you're
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.960]   rejected by the peer review paper, you can take it to a pharmaceutical company, they
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.640]   have an incentive to find out whether you're right, it can go out there in the real world,
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.000]   it can work, and then that changes sort of the ideas in economics.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.400]   In social sciences, a few things, it's more complex, so sometimes in some ways, it's harder
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.140]   to know what actually works and what doesn't, we don't, we don't do like randomized experiments
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:31.480]   on big things, we do like, like polling questions, but not on like, you know, you know, the state
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.280]   have this kind of economic reform, and the state have this other economic reform, we
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.480]   don't do it, anything like that.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.320]   And I think part of the reason we don't do that, and this is another, this is the second
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:47.120]   big reason why social science is, you know, so hard, is because there's not as much social
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.960]   desirability bias, people don't have, you know, deep-seated beliefs about the best way
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.960]   to get a vaccine.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.060]   I guess some people do, they say that mRNA vaccine is scary, but in general, about these
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.720]   physical things, right?
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.540]   People don't have strong beliefs about the way they want the world to work, right?
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.640]   And when it comes to the social sciences, people have very, very strong ideas about
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   the way the world, the way the world should work, and when you combine that with a lack
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:17.480]   of accountability, with a lack of any real-world test, in the form of, you know, markets, or
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   some kind of, you know, real experimentation, people can just, you know, believe whatever
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.680]   they want, or believe whatever, you know, some kind of like vested interest, like the
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.040]   State Department and, you know, the Pentagon bureaucracy, basically, whoever's in power
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.680]   wants to believe.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:39.080]   And so this is why social science is hard, and this is why social desirability bias is,
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.160]   I think, the enemy in the search for truth.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.520]   Now, one thing about economics is, I think it's more of a male-dominated field, it's
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:52.720]   a more, you know, they have mathematical sort of requirements that are more stringent, I
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.080]   think that weeds out a lot of people, I think it's more of a sort of a, I think, you know,
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.560]   there's a sort of a, you know, there's complaints from other disciplines that economics is a
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.040]   little bit mean and aggressive.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.560]   When I was in, I got my PhD in political science, I was, you know, surprised to find that sometimes,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.080]   you know, somebody's theory would just fall apart, and then everyone, like other people
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.680]   would not just say, okay, this is wrong, go study something else, they would be like,
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.400]   oh, it's okay, just, you know, adjust it this way, and then like nobody, you know, there
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.240]   was always, I always felt like people were treating others with sort of kid gloves, right?
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.280]   I think there was a culture in other fields, and this is political science and probably
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.640]   much worse in other fields, of not sort of this sort of a willingness to, you know, to
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.880]   really hurt feelings and to, you know, and to, you know, just willingness to be wronged.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.520]   I think economics has done that better than other fields, and I think there's a movement
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.640]   to make, I've been talking to other economists, people in economics who agree with this, there's
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.680]   been a movement to make economics like other fields, and that would potentially be, that
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.240]   would potentially be disastrous.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   Right, right.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.680]   But now, it doesn't seem clear to me that even before calls for diversity dumbed down
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.000]   academia, that things were that much better.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.720]   You know, there were like fads like communism or disarmament that were popular in academia,
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.520]   and you know, like if you look at the Vietnam War, it was waged by people who had, you know,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.760]   like Kissinger, McNamara, people who had degrees from prestigious universities, and you know,
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.000]   they were white and male, but they were still, you know, they still were disconnected from
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   the outside world.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.680]   So have like newer developments in academia actually made it worse?
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:26.720]   Well, no, I mean, white males can have, you know, the same pathologies as any other group.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:33.240]   The, yeah, I think the international, you know, the dumbing down of academia, you know,
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.600]   I think is a problem, you know, were Kissinger and these, you know, these guys, you know,
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.200]   if you look at the Vietnam War, you know, it's very, it's actually very interesting,
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.360]   because everyone sort of knew from like, you know, from the Johnson administration, the
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.600]   Nixon administration, that basically, you know, they were, you know, that it wasn't
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.560]   winnable, that what they were saying to the public wasn't true.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.520]   And I think that, you know, that if you look at like, the historical record of what politicians
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:03.800]   were saying personally, they were amazingly explicit in their willingness to admit to
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.040]   themselves and those around them, that they were doing stuff for political reasons, right.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:13.560]   So I think they were responding to, I think they were responding to basically, political
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.800]   pressure and basically, you know, public opinion, and sometimes using public opinion for their
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   own ends.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.040]   I, you know, I don't think if you took professors at international relations, and like, whatever
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.760]   that the equivalent of that would have been, and whether they support Vietnam, I don't
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   think so.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.520]   I think the big the big names, like the ones who were not connected to the government,
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.520]   right.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.320]   So Kissinger, I mean, it's hard, because he's like, you know, he's a guy who was in academia,
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.920]   but also like in and out of government, right.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:44.480]   And you know, like, it's, it's, you wouldn't expect that person to have like, you know,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.000]   you wouldn't, you wouldn't, you know, because if he had different views, basically, he wouldn't
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   be in government.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   That's the issue.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.080]   His views had yet to be selected, to, to at least be tolerable to whoever, you know, the
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.240]   President happened to be at the moment.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:04.800]   And so yeah, I mean, the least I think the dumbing down of academia, I think they move
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.520]   away from sort of explicit, sort of more hard standards, like just basically being able
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.800]   to meet some standard of mathematical ability, you know, the, the rise of, you know, cancel
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.240]   culture against free speech, all these things are harmful, doesn't mean that there weren't
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   a lot of pathologies before.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   And yeah, we can, we can see that definitely.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   You know, it was whether expertise has gotten better, overall.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   I mean, I think that, you know, so if you look at a political scientist from the 19,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.360]   you know, look at just some other fields from the 1960s or 1970s, and you look at political
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:36.280]   science today, if you go to Twitter, and you know, there's a, so there's like a, like a
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.480]   subject about the political science.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.080]   So it's like a good gauge of like, what the most prominent political scientists are saying.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.200]   And it's all stupid, like graphs, like democracy has gone down 16.2%, since Republicans started
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.800]   to take power in this state.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   It's really, really stupid.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.440]   I mean, you get the, you know, the mean, the median political scientists from the 1960s,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.520]   1970s, there's nothing that ridiculous.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.800]   So I do think, you know, it probably has gotten worse.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:04.120]   But okay, so we would, the problems you're pointing out with academia seem like they're
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.360]   inherent to any institution that is disconnected from the market, and also to like, something
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.400]   that can be empirically measured, but we would like to have expert knowledge and fields like
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.540]   international relations, or criminology, or psychology, right?
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:22.440]   So is there any way to set up institutions that can study these sort of ambiguous topics
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.320]   in a way that actually adds insight to the way we legislate?
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.480]   You know, do we, do we need expert expertise?
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:34.000]   Do we even need expertise in international relations, or criminology, or psychology?
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.760]   You know, I tend to believe that the cost, you know, I tend to believe that the costs
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.020]   are more, I tend to believe the costs are, you know, that they outweigh the benefits
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.020]   actually here.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.360]   I think a lot, I think if you rely on common sense for crime, for controlling crime, and
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.800]   some basic statistics, right?
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.240]   I think you're better than, than the field of criminology.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.320]   I would definitely test, you know, I would definitely, you know, take the, I think there's
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.680]   an idea in like the public that, you know, if you, you know, if you want to stop crime
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.720]   and for, you know, come down very hard on crime, and I think that's, you know, maybe
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.600]   more controversial among criminologists.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.240]   But I think the problem is, actually I wouldn't say that, I haven't done any survey of criminology,
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.840]   but this is part of the problem, in that you have this field called criminology, and even
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.480]   if it like arrives at something that's like, you know, that's true or logical, you know,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.520]   or they have like some unambiguous finding, the people, there will always be criminologists
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.800]   who politicians who want to do something else will rely on, and they will go and they will,
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.060]   you know, find those people.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.720]   So having this category called criminologists, and unless we're going to like survey the
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.120]   field and just do, you know, who knows if that'll work, but unless you're going to like
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.280]   survey the field and then just do whatever that consists of the field, you're going to
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.160]   end up, the media politicians, they're going to be selecting the people that they want
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   during the COVID stuff.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.280]   You know, they always say experts say this, experts say that, but you look at the, you
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.800]   know, the, something like the Great Barrington Declaration, and I just, hearing about media,
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.960]   I thought these people were crooks and nobodies, and then I went to look at their credentials,
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.480]   they were like Harvard Medical School, Stanford Medical School, and somehow when the media
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.800]   cites expertise, it's never these people, right?
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.640]   It's always the most hysterical person possible, pushing for some kind of restriction.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.360]   So I think the idea, you know, expertise, you know, potentially can be valuable, but
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.480]   the idea of expertise can be harmful, and that basically, you know, gives certain people
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.760]   power who want to do things, you know, more sort of legitimacy to do things that are irrational.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   Now I think that like, you know, at a broader level, you know, I trust, you know, things
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.560]   like prediction markets, like economic markets, things that are, that don't rely on credentials
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.740]   but rely on track records of getting things right, and I would, you know, agree with Robin
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.220]   Hansen and others who would, you know, cheer for these things to have, potentially have
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.120]   more of an effect on policymaking or the way we think about issues.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.120]   - Okay, now let's talk about politics.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.080]   So you say that one of the reasons that liberalism has been winning is because liberals just
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:53.320]   care more about politics, but how does that explain why things have shifted more liberal
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.320]   over the last few decades?
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.720]   Is it just that conservatives have started caring less about politics, and liberals have
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.240]   started caring more about politics?
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   What's changed?
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.680]   - Actually, to a certain extent, yes.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.760]   So in 2016, there was a huge mobilization effect on the left, so I do have a sub-stack
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.960]   called 2016, the turning point, I just used 2016 for convenience, but basically if you
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:21.200]   look at like 2010 versus like 2016 to 2020, and like your probability, for example, of
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.280]   having attended a protest or signed a petition if you were a conservative versus liberal,
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.160]   it was maybe you were two or three times more likely as a liberal in 2010 by 2016 to 2020,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.480]   I mean it was multiples of that, it was something like 10 times more likely to have done these
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   things.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   So I think that national politics and sort of the mood has a lot to do with it.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.240]   I think Trump mobilized a lot of people on the left, he did not, he mobilized a lot of
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.760]   voters on the right, like low-percentage voters who wouldn't otherwise vote came out and voted
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.840]   for Trump, and it was pretty good for Republicans, and they were concentrated in certain states,
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.120]   and that tended to be good for Republicans politically, or at least makes it bad, while
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:04.560]   I think Trump did a terrible job of sort of motivating people who are activists or sort
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.080]   of people who would be bureaucrats or lawyers or the people who actually make policy on
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   a day-to-day basis.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:15.600]   He really turned those people off and made them, if anything, made them more liberal.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.560]   And so yeah, I would say that changing engagement over time is part of the story.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.360]   So I'm wondering how this theory explains why certain institutions are especially more
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.360]   liberal.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:30.640]   So let's say, for example, Big Tech, right, or compared to a company like Walmart, right?
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.760]   Now I don't expect that if I went to a Walmart headquarters, I'd see a whole bunch of BLM
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.440]   posters, but if I go to a Facebook office, I bet I'll see a few things like that, or
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.360]   like diversity is their strength or something like that.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.600]   But both of these companies have faced pressure from liberal employees, both of these companies
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.760]   have to face civil rights lawsuits, and it's not like in the famed companies, you have
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:58.880]   a bunch of people who have given up high salaries in order to have a position of cultural influence
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.640]   because they're making a lot of money there, right?
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.400]   So it's not like journalism or something.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.280]   So what explains why Big Tech especially is super woke?
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:13.600]   Yeah, so Big Tech is such an interesting case because until 2015 and 2016, there was a lot
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.520]   of calls for censorship from the media.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.440]   And Twitter basically didn't censor anybody until 2015, and Facebook too.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:28.960]   So basically the Big Tech was a lot less woke than the media wanted them to be.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.040]   I think that there was basically a lot of political pressure that came down on them
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.040]   from the top.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.240]   I think Mark Zuckerberg is, you know, Jack Dorsey are relatively not woke people compared
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.160]   to a lot of elites in America.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:50.400]   You know, when tech, and I think other people have made this point, basically the initial
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.560]   generation of leaders in tech, they were the people who were the pioneers, they were non-conformists,
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   right?
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.000]   They tended to be less, you know, they tended to do their own thing, and they would have
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.320]   their own political and social views, right?
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.080]   And then when tech sort of became established, it started to draw people who were more conformists.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:15.320]   And that's why people have put forth the argument that basically crypto now is more right wing
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.800]   than tech because crypto is sort of the next cutting edge thing that non-conformists are
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   doing.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   So I think tech, I mean, it started out, I think, with a more of a libertarian ethos,
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.960]   and it sort of became the establishment and became sort of the thing for high conformist
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   people to do.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:37.400]   And, you know, I think that that's probably explains its wokification over time.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.480]   And then something like, you know, Wal-Mart, I mean, you know, and I think, you know, just
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.320]   sort of the ether right now is if you're an idealistic person, it's easier to be idealistic
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   on the left than the right.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.840]   I mean, I don't think the right has done a good job of providing sort of an idealistic
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.920]   vision that appeals to a lot of people.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.040]   When I think if you go work for Wal-Mart, you know, your views are more maybe, you know,
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.480]   you get enough meaning from, you know, just getting the logistics right and getting people
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   the goods and services they need.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   So I think that attracts a completely different kind of person.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.720]   Sorry, I don't think I understood the difference between Wal-Mart and Big Tech in that case.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.320]   Like, but in Big Tech, you're also doing stuff like, you know, shipping a product that like
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.680]   you can get meaning out of that as well, right?
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.820]   And then in both those cases, they're like getting older, in Big Tech, they're becoming
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.720]   older institutions that attract informants.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.480]   So why is Big Tech more woke?
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.800]   So Amazon, you're working on like logistics, right?
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:29.440]   I mean, Facebook and Google and Twitter are sort of more in the, you know, because they're
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.520]   not actually producing anything out there, you know, you could say that they're having
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.680]   to tell themselves a story about why they're doing something good for the world, and some
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.480]   people, you know, believe in that story, you know, they convince themselves of it or they
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.280]   believe in it or they don't.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.520]   So like this kind of like, you know, like the Google thing, like don't be evil, right?
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:50.960]   I mean, this sort of idea that they were doing something social and revolutionary, I think
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.880]   was part of the ethos from the start, while Wal-Mart, you know, they want to get you lower
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.900]   prices and, you know, make your life better.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.400]   But I don't think it ever had that idea that you were going to fundamentally revolutionize
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.960]   society by having more Wal-Marts, right?
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   All right.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.240]   Yeah, it's kind of analogous to American foreign policy in a way that like, you know, like
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:12.280]   Google is something like America, and that we have, they have an explicit creed and then
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.640]   they had to do stuff to further that creed that actually might make things worse.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   That's interesting.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.680]   So you write that one thing that your theory can somewhat help vindicate is authoritarian
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.680]   populism.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   Not that you necessarily support it, but just the idea that, you know, you can have a right-wing
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.400]   government that pushes back on the liberal elite who just care more than conservatives,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.080]   even if they're not more numerous.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:40.400]   I wonder if, compared to this, you think this theory also vindicates libertarianism more?
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:44.480]   Because in that case, you just, first of all, you don't have the funds for this rent-seeking
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.760]   elite to be able to survive.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.480]   So, you know, there's less journalism, academia, and also there's like less these elites can
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.160]   do to like actually coerce people without the help of government.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.560]   So you're getting at sort of my, you know, the sort of the motivation behind a lot of
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.200]   my writing on American politics, which I, you know, I'm disturbed by wokeness.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.960]   And I think that the fight against wokeness has been confused and not very effective,
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.920]   which is, you know, it's almost like, you know, that has to be self-evident because
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:14.400]   wokeness has gone so far and, you know, won so much.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.480]   And so I'm thinking about, you know, the different ways you can go about sort of working against
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   it.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.120]   So I, you know, I'm not saying, you know, I'm not coming down on, you know, I think
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.080]   that, you know, I'd like to just have one sort of thing, it's either libertarianism
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.560]   or it's populist, you know, or authoritarian, although I think that, you know, the words
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.520]   like those are very sort of selectively used, but whether it's like a more interventionist
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:38.920]   or non-interventionist, you know, I don't think that like the ideal response would be
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.160]   a pure version of either of these, right?
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.040]   So I, what you could say for the libertarian perspective is that, and Robbie Swolevig reason,
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.280]   that's, that's the lesson he took from my article, was basically like, you know, they're
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.360]   going to, you know, whatever you try to pass, you say the government has to be like this
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.400]   or it has to be like that, it's going to get around it.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.440]   And one thing they can't get around is you cut off their funding, you stop giving money
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   to the universities.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.480]   There's, there's, you know, they have, they're not going to go out and they just don't have
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.720]   the funding anymore to do the stuff that they want to do.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.840]   You pass a law saying they have to be politically fair and give conservatives a fair hearing.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.320]   Well, I mean, who do you think is going to be interpreting that law and deciding what
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.720]   a fair hearing is and what political discrimination is and, and all that.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.320]   So yeah, there's something to that, I mean, shrinking, like saying, you know, the government
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:29.680]   and sort of these institutions that are under the influence of, you know, bureaucrats and
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:35.040]   activists, just shrinking their role in society rather than remaking them, remaking those
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   institutions.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.360]   I mean, there's something to be said for that.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.560]   But then like, you know, it depends on like what you want, right?
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.020]   If you are really bothered by, you know, if you're really bothered by the direction of
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:54.240]   the culture and the fact that, you know, activists, you know, are, are, you know, propagandizing
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.200]   or, or people who basically are, you know, just the market, I mean, whoever's or whoever,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.080]   you know, the media institutions and popular music and culture.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.000]   If you're upset that they're, you know, they're selling sexual promiscuity to children, for
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.680]   example, you know, you might, you know, have a, you know, you might have a more forceful
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.680]   response to that.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:19.360]   I mean, you can't, there's, there's probably, you know, there's probably not a answer within
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.080]   the confines of libertarianism or it's very hard.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.920]   I mean, you could set up your own private community and go off and do something, right?
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.320]   And they're, you know, potentially there's something there, but, you know, you could
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.480]   potentially say, you know, I don't like what's considered art now.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.300]   I don't like what's considered pop culture.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.200]   And you might just say, well, that's the, that's the only potential thing you can do.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.640]   - I'm not sure I follow, like, if you're a parent, right, like just don't buy your kid
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.640]   porn.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   I mean, I guess you have to buy them a smartphone at some point, but.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.640]   - You have to buy them a smartphone.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.480]   I mean, they have friends of all their, if you, if you can, you know, you can only afford
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.200]   to send them to a public school and everyone else is watching porn in the bathroom.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.760]   I mean, I don't know, like, you know, the people are influenced by that, right?
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   So it's not, you know, I don't think it's as easy as turn off the TV.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.280]   I think we all exist within this culture and, you know, there's a, you know, what other
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   people do does affect you.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   - Right, right.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.560]   But I guess I'm skeptical to the extent of what right-wing government can actually influence
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.560]   the culture.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.920]   And that brings me to the next topic I want to talk to you about, which is fertility,
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   right?
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:18.080]   So you're more optimistic about what countries like China and Hungary can do about fertility.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.080]   But it seems to me that if like giving people checks doesn't get them to fuck, like, I don't
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   know.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.560]   I don't know if like, you know, banning makeups on guy is going to actually make a difference.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.520]   - Well, I mean, so you look at, you know, you step back and you look at sort of what
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.600]   correlates with high fertility levels, right?
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.280]   And it seems more clearly to be associated with culture than economic situation.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.960]   As humans have become more able to afford kids, they've tended to have less of them,
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   right?
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.720]   So this is a pretty strong argument against it being an economic issue, or largely an
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.800]   economic issue as a driver of differential fertility rates.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.360]   And then, you know, you look at things like, so religiosity are, you know, very important.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.920]   And the question is, can government influence culture, right?
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.320]   I see no reason to think it can't.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.880]   I think one thing civil rights law, I think one of my main arguments on civil rights law
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.480]   is it actually did influence the culture.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.800]   And even that wasn't that heavy handed compared to say what the Chinese government could do
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   potentially.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.160]   So yeah, if you take the idea that fertility is a cultural issue and that government can't
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.160]   have an influence on culture, then it basically follows that government, if it wanted to,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.360]   if it wanted to change the fertility rate or potentially a lot of other things, you
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.760]   know, it can do so through the control of the culture.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   - Right, right.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:35.560]   But I guess one, one reason to be optimistic is, depending on your perspective, to be optimistic
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.160]   about China's fertility is, you know, like, listen, look at what they did with COVID where
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.520]   they were able to like just bolt people down in their houses until like there were zero
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.520]   cases in the area.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.520]   - Yeah.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.320]   - And if they, you know, with the Western countries couldn't do that, so they couldn't
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.320]   get COVID under control.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.160]   So what if they did something similar on fertility?
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.000]   But there doesn't seem to be some obvious analogous human rights violation that you
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.640]   do to like increase fertility that, that the West is not willing to try, right?
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.840]   It's just like, what are you going to do that's analogous to...
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.840]   - Sure, sure there is.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   You can, you know, ban all anti-NATOist propaganda.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:09.000]   You can make the education system just be nothing but, you know, about how you should
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.780]   have children for the fatherland.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:15.960]   You could, you know, tax single people and unmarried people at 100% and, you know, give
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.800]   all their money to, you know, there's tons of stuff you could do, like, you know, whether
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.600]   that's good, you know, whether that goes to like something like zero COVID is where, you
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.860]   know, the fact that China did it is pretty impressive.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.340]   Whether it was worth it, you know, I think, you know, they've probably gotten overboard
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.340]   at this point.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.340]   Right.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.340]   So you can debate whether it's worth it.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.440]   But I think, you know, yeah, having a competent and authoritarian government sort of opens
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.440]   up different possibilities.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:41.160]   - By the way, so you think by what year is China's fertility going to be 1.9, 2031, right?
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160]   - Yes.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.160]   So I give it 2031.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.120]   I mean, I'm the, you know, I'm the only, you know, I talk to other smart people and I'm
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.560]   sort of out on the limb here and, you know, the other one, you know, other smart people,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.440]   they either think it's impossible or they think the world is not going to be there in
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.280]   the part of the Chinese government.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.560]   But yeah, I take a different view and I explain it in my sub-stack.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.680]   - By the way, I'd make you a small bet on that if you're all right for willing.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.720]   So like I'd give you like even three to one odds.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   - That it won't be 1.9?
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   - Okay.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   - It would be less than 1.9, yeah.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   - Okay.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.720]   Well, 1.9 is my median.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.720]   So if, yeah, I'd have to take that.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   - All right.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:19.800]   We'll figure out the conditions later on, but, oh, and then are you afraid that what
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.600]   these countries will do to actually increase fertility, if that'll have a dysgenic effect,
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   right?
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.880]   So if it's just that, if it's cash transfers or just sort of economic incentive, you know,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.440]   maybe it's the people on the margins who like desperately needed the cash, we're going to
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.280]   have more babies, and these are exactly the kind of people who, or, yeah, you know what
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.280]   I'm saying.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.720]   - Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:46.560]   I think that, you know, so if you, let's say the government went down the cultural path
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:51.840]   and just tried to propagandize people at the highest level to have as many kids as possible,
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.840]   right?
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.200]   Are smart people or stupid people more prone to propaganda?
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.240]   I think the argument could be made that smart people are.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.240]   I mean, you look at wokeness.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.960]   I mean, smart people tend to accept that a lot more than stupid people, so maybe it's
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   the opposite.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.640]   Maybe the smartest people will take the hint most clearly and change their behavior while
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   the stupid people won't, or maybe the stupider are just sort of more, it might be different
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.800]   kinds of propaganda appeal to different kinds of people, so something like that's nationalistic
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:25.400]   might appeal disproportionately to stupid people, or, you know, and something like wokeness
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:29.240]   and, like, more, you know, it's more idealistic and sort of differs from reality might appeal
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:34.080]   to smart people, but I don't think, you know, so that's one potential, you know, one potential
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:39.120]   issue, but I, historically, if you look at, like, the way nationalism came about, it was
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.360]   the elites generally who were nationalistic first, and then it sort of trickled down to
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.600]   the masses, so I don't think there's necessarily a sort of a rule of human nature that anything
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:53.080]   sort of nationalist or right-wing propaganda necessarily only disproportionately appeals
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:58.400]   to the less intelligent, but it's a fascinating question, like, what the, you know, compositional
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.760]   effects are, would it hazard to predict that, you know, like, just, I think it'd get the
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.800]   birthrate up, whether it'll be smart people or not smart people, I don't know.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:11.200]   Right, it's probably still net good in either case, but I don't know about China, but, like,
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.720]   for example, if the government tried to actually change the culture in America to make it more
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.000]   pro-natalist, I could, like, very well imagine that it would have a counter-predictive effect,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.840]   because then it would become counter-cultural or contrarian to, like, opposing a right-wing
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.600]   government and, like, not have kids, right?
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:29.000]   Yeah, so it depends on, like, what, you know, what kind, so if, like, yeah, if the Republican
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.520]   Party took power and said, oh, you know, our biggest thing is getting the fertility rate
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.840]   up, and it was, like, somebody like Trump who just triggered all educated people, yeah,
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.600]   that could probably, that would probably backfire.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:45.440]   You know, so in some place like China, I mean, I've seen some data that indicates that, like,
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:49.600]   the elites are more educated or more nationalistic, so they could actually just, you know, they
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.920]   could be united in favor of, you know, they could be very potentially receptive to such
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.840]   a message.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.760]   It's so complicated, because, like, it's, like, China, I think Chinese elites see themselves
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.200]   as part of a country that's competing with the U.S.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.720]   While U.S. elites don't see themselves really as people competing with China, they see themselves
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.880]   as people, you know, competing with other Americans or competing with, you know, nature
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.920]   and trying to change the world or get, you know, social peace.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.880]   So there's completely different dynamics there, and this might be one reason why, sort of,
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.800]   you know, the West has become left-wing as it's become more dominant, and, like, elites
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:27.560]   don't have anybody to compete with or, you know, try to feel, try to defeat or feel superior
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.560]   to.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:34.880]   You know, the Western gap between, you know, in recent, in the decades of World War II,
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:39.240]   you know, between the Westerners and the rest of the world was so large that, you know,
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.520]   they weren't really seen as, you know, competition.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.160]   And that, you know, might change with, you know, the rise of China, but I don't think
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.000]   it's, I don't think it's, like, really registered as something that's fundamentally shaping
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   people's outlook.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.120]   So, yeah, it's, yeah, it's, you know, the compositional, you know, the compositional,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.880]   you know, effects and, sort of, who's responsive to propaganda, you know, these are, these
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.880]   are fascinating questions.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.760]   I, you know, I think it's hard to predict in advance.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.920]   You just, you know, you just have to, sort of, you just, you know, you watch what people
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.680]   do and then, you know, one thing the, actually, you brought up the economic point, so, like,
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:14.000]   there's a, you know, there's, if you make, like, say, a cash transfer for each child,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.800]   right, like $10,000, for example, that matters a lot more to a poor person than a rich person.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:24.960]   Now, if you do something like, you cut how much they're paying in taxes, right, and some,
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:31.400]   I think, I think, I think they did this in Quebec and, I think, and then Hungarian, sort
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.160]   of, system works like this, too, where if you're getting tax breaks, the rich people
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:40.680]   pay more taxes, it could potentially be worth more to, to rich people to have more kids.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:46.960]   So, it's, yeah, so the structure of how it's set up would also matter quite a bit.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.880]   And, okay, final question, what should Libertarians do in order to win?
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.880]   So, like, in the next 20, 30 years, given your theory of politics, what should the Libertarian
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.880]   strategy be?
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.480]   They should hope for ridiculous polarization.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:05.000]   They should hope for Americans to hate each other because Libertarian ideas are unpopular.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.160]   The only way you get them is you, basically, you make them, you take over the Republican
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.120]   Party, and then they just win 50% of the time, no matter what they do, and they're going
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.080]   to have to control certain states no matter what, and they have a lot of more freedom
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.280]   to do unpopular things.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.680]   I think, I think that, I think that's, I think polarization is actually good for Libertarianism,
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.760]   and I think we might, you know, we might actually, they might have a good few decades, actually.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   Right.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.920]   That also, by the way, explains very well why Wilkiness has been winning in the last
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920]   few decades, right?
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.160]   Bigger thinkers, polarization, they can get unpopular things fast.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.920]   It's a cause, and it's a consequence of polarization, right, so these things, these things work
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920]   together.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.800]   I think what Libertarians should do, and I think I'm doing a part of this, is they should
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.720]   really make clear to me, so like there's this idea on like the populist right that like
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.840]   we tried Libertarianism, and now Wilkiness has taken over, and I'm like, okay, when did
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.000]   Republicans repeal the Civil Rights Act, like when did that happen, when did they defund
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.440]   public education, like, no, you actually haven't done anything close to Libertarianism, and
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.960]   now you're making Libertarianism the scapegoat for all these negative trends, so in my argument,
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.880]   in my article, "Woke Institutions, It's Just Civil Rights Law," I try to make people, make
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.760]   people clear, like, the Conservatives haven't been Libertarian enough, they haven't even
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.200]   talked about this stuff or understood the downstream effects of broad interpretation
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.720]   of civil rights law on business and the wider culture, so, you know, I think people should
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.080]   have, you know, they should try it, because people really are motivated by anti-wokeness.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.720]   Some people are motivated by the idea of small government and what it can do, but you can
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.880]   reach people who are motivated by anti-wokeness, and that's a lot, a lot of people on the right.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.560]   And if you explain to them how Libertarianism can help them and what they want to do anyway,
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.160]   I think that's a good strategy.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   Okay.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.360]   All right, well, those are all the questions I had, Richard, thanks so much for being on
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.360]   the podcast.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.360]   Pleasure.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   It's been great.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   Thanks.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   Bye.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:02:02.360]   Bye.
