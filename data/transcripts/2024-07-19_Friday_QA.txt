[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.480]   a show dedicated to providing you with knowledge, skills,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.760]   insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and

[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.840]   freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.880]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.560]   Today is Friday, July 19, 2024.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.480]   And on this Friday, as we do on any Friday,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.640]   when the computers are working and the internet is working
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.960]   and all of the microphones are hooked up and all of that,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600]   we do live Q&A.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.880]   You set the show for today.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.240]   If you're new to here Radical Personal Finance, welcome.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.440]   I'm glad that you are here.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.600]   And I'm glad that you can join me on a live Q&A show.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.160]   These are open line shows.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.960]   You get to call in, talk about anything that you want.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.760]   You set the agenda.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.680]   You ask any question.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.160]   You raise any topic.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.880]   We can talk about your personal situation,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.320]   discuss some question or challenge that you're thinking.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.000]   We can talk about some philosophical consideration.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.680]   That's all up to you.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.800]   If you'd like to join me for one of these Friday Q&A shows,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.480]   you can do that by going to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.520]   Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.840]   Sign up to support the show on Patreon,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920]   and that will gain access for you to one of these Friday Q&A
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.680]   shows.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.880]   I do that to allow me to just simply meter
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.360]   the flow of callers a little bit,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.640]   keep it to a manageable four, five, six, something
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.040]   like that, which really works out for a one to three hour
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.960]   show.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.240]   And so you can, again, go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.680]   if you would like to join me on a future show.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.200]   Just in beginning, as I record this on Friday, July 19,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.920]   I just want to point out, obviously,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.720]   hopefully you are aware of the large IT outage
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.920]   all around the world.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920]   Quite interesting to see.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.960]   Huge disruptions in the travel industry,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.080]   significant disruptions in all kinds of businesses.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.960]   Many just normal businesses finding themselves
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.000]   unable to do work, unable to process admissions,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.600]   credit card machines down, all kinds
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.040]   of issues around the world.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.720]   The extent of the situation is not particularly yet clear.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.740]   There seems to be some improvements going on,
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.400]   which is great.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.200]   And so hopefully it'll just turn out to be a minor blip,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.800]   and we'll be able to get back to kind of life as normal.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.520]   However, one of my core philosophies
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.760]   that I urge you to consider accepting for yourself
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.520]   is simply, when something bad goes wrong,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.800]   assume that it happened to you.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.400]   And what would that look like?
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.800]   So if something bad happens to someone else,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   and you're not affected, then just ask yourself, all right,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   well, if that happened to me, how would I be affected?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.480]   And by just systematically doing that over time
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.360]   and then putting in plans to mitigate
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.880]   whatever the long-term consequences of a bad situation
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.720]   would be, you'll build yourself into a much more prepared
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.480]   individual, much more resilient, and you'll
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.200]   be prepared to go through difficult times
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.400]   with less disruption to your life, to your business,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520]   and also to be able to help people who are not
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.600]   as fortunate.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.000]   So as you look at--
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.880]   I'm sure that some of you are affected by the current events.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   As you look at computers not working,
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.920]   just ask yourself, if my computer didn't work,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.460]   do I have backup plans?
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.960]   If everything was corrupted forever,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.480]   if my computer shut off today and I couldn't get anything,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.600]   is there a backup plan?
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   Do I have the ability to go and get my data?
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.280]   Do I have my data backed up?
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.160]   It's a good thing to ask.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.080]   Think about how you would collect payment
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.280]   if you're running a business.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.480]   Do we have an alternate form of payment?
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.160]   Think about what would happen if the electricity went out.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.680]   I saw one quote from some professed expert
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.920]   who said that this is much more like what we were expecting on--
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.840]   what was it called?
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.400]   Y2K.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.320]   Much more what we were expecting from Y2K
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.280]   than Y2K itself turned out to be.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.200]   So what would you do if the power went off for two weeks?
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.760]   There's been hurricanes recently where
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.680]   people are going through a week without power.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.760]   What would you do if you just had no electricity
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.680]   for a couple of weeks?
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.920]   Do you have some plans in place for that?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.640]   So just use these examples and try to learn from them
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.680]   in order to position yourself for future success.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.760]   With that, we go to the phones.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.400]   Seth in Nebraska, welcome to the show.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.440]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.980]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.640]   Can you hear me?
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.320]   Sounds good, yes.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.820]   Great.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.280]   So yeah, so I've been listening to you since 2016.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.160]   That was my summer after my sophomore year of college.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.240]   I was 20 at the time.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.560]   I'm 28 now.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.080]   So my wife and I got married that summer
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.200]   with an unplanned daughter on the way.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.840]   She had already had a two-year-old daughter
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.880]   at the time as well.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.960]   So I kind of went from a carefree college guy
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.760]   to a father of two in about a nine-month span there.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.520]   So that's when I started listening to you.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.140]   I knew my finances were pretty much cooked.
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.400]   And little did I know, they were more cooked than I even
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   had thought at the time.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.200]   So I started listening to you.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.800]   I was making $11 an hour working on a golf course doing
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.520]   the grounds maintenance, living off
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.320]   of student loans, Pell Grants, WIC, food stamps,
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.040]   all that stuff, and then eventually credit card debt.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.760]   So graduated early, became a teacher.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.960]   And with your encouragement, talking about increasing
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.280]   income, I ended up doing lawns on the side
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   since I had learned how to take care of stuff
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.220]   like that with the golf courses.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.720]   I just went out student teaching,
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.800]   and then I was teaching with my actual job.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.200]   I was able to grow the lawn company large enough
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.640]   that I was able to quit teaching after my second year.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.800]   That was the COVID year.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.040]   So it was actually kind of nice to get out of there
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.840]   because I had a lot of teacher friends saying the year
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.120]   after that with all the masking was pretty much awful.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.680]   So that was great.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.160]   So the thing is, I'm making a pretty solid income right now.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.360]   It's nothing great.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.800]   Nebraska's cost of living is really low,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.440]   but that helps a lot.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.680]   So I'm making about--
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.600]   so I'm able to pay myself a net salary of about $80,000.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.280]   The business itself, we should gross minimum $400,000
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.040]   this year, but it could be a lot larger than that.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.080]   But I'll discuss here in a second kind of the issues.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.000]   I'm wondering what I need to do to grow my business in a way
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.760]   that eventually I can sell it.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.320]   I'm not really interested in selling it right now.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.600]   There's no rush.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.400]   I do understand that this is essentially talking
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.000]   about building a bridge to wealth.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.280]   And I understand that this is my bridge,
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.360]   and I shouldn't tear it down or give up
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.520]   on it when I'm five feet away from the other shoreline trying
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.920]   to start a new one.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.600]   But I'm also understanding that it
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.560]   is a narrow bridge that takes a lot of maintenance.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.640]   I understand that--
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.400]   well, I'm realizing more and more now
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.520]   that the low barrier of entry for lawn care that
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.760]   allowed me to get into it when I was on food stamps
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.840]   and things like that at the time are also
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.040]   the reasons why it's not really terribly profitable,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.000]   as well as the employees in this line of work
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.400]   are oftentimes not great.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.680]   They are seasonal.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.000]   They seem to just--
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.160]   you get a good one here and there, and then they--
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   I've got a couple of good ones that I've gotten to stick
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.480]   around, but it's just really tough as far as consistency
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.720]   goes.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   And I just find myself basically working my butt off
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.040]   to keep the business going.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.280]   And I basically just come in and save the day.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.240]   And I realize, wow, I'm doing 20 or 30 hours a week
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   of $25 manual labor when I could be using
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.080]   my time in a lot better ways.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.520]   And so because of all that, I've been transitioning a little bit
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.760]   more into fertilization pest control
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.480]   because it does have higher profit margins.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.960]   People are paying you because they don't
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.160]   know how to do the applications.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.120]   They're afraid to mess up with the chemicals
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.400]   versus with lawn mowing.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.160]   It's like, oh, I just don't want to do it,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.640]   so I'm going to pay some guy to come out and cut the grass.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.880]   So that is something that's positive.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.840]   We doubled our fertilization customers this year
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.040]   while keeping our mowing customers the same.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.720]   So as far as just right now with the business,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.400]   I plan on continuing that fertilization route
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.000]   so that the business is just a little bit easier on me.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.080]   It's really hard to keep a strict schedule where
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.280]   you have your Monday yards, Tuesday yards, Wednesday
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.480]   yards, and they're the same every single week when
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.640]   you have seasonal employees that are not consistent.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.280]   Whereas fertilization, the schedule's a little bit easier.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.360]   And again, the lower labor percent
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.640]   just makes it a lot easier to pay guys more.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.520]   They have to do certification tests and things like that.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.940]   So that's what I'm doing right now
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.480]   to keep the business going in a way that's making
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.080]   it a little bit easier on myself.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.960]   But I don't see myself necessarily
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.680]   continuing with this business in 10 years.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.400]   So I want to be building other companies,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.600]   investing in real estate, doing things like that.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.880]   I love inventing things.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.760]   I want to have several sources of income
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.680]   other than just this one company.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.080]   That basically makes it where every day I'm
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.480]   worried about the weather.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.000]   All year long, I'm checking the weather app.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.880]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.560]   I probably have a record for how often I check the weather app.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.520]   And then as well as, I can't plan a trip
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.360]   because the second I do, two days before the trip,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.220]   somebody quits.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.760]   Or during the trip, two guys don't show up,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.240]   and I'm sitting there on this trip.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.120]   All I just wanted to do is just take a Thursday and Friday off.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.440]   And then now all of a sudden, it's Saturday,
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.160]   and half the Friday yards aren't even done yet.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.600]   And I only have one guy out there working.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.100]   And it's like I'm sitting there stressed out about it.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.400]   So the questions I really have--
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.840]   I know it's kind of a long intro--
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.760]   but how do I structure the business from here on out
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.440]   so that when I want to sell it, I can?
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.840]   When do I know the right time to sell it in my life?
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.600]   Again, I'd like to have other businesses in play that are
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.680]   also bringing me income.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.560]   I'm not going to just throw this away
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.600]   before I'm set up with other things.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.520]   And then other certain milestones
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.080]   that maybe I need in the business that
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.880]   make it more desirable for people to purchase it--
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.760]   I don't know if that's the amount of income,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.840]   the amount of time the owner, myself,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.440]   am putting in on a weekly basis.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   Should I be keeping track of that, my hours?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.260]   And then also a solid place of residence.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.040]   Right now, we are working out of a rented shop.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.840]   It's actually basically a storage facility.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.800]   There's a couple other businesses
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.760]   that work out of there.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.280]   But would it be better for me to purchase a place?
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.200]   Does that look better?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   Or is that even worse?
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.160]   Because when somebody buys it, are they
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.280]   going to move everything to their place anyway?
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.280]   Now they have this property that they deal with?
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:10.920]   Things like that.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.760]   Got it.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.960]   Congratulations on all your progress
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.000]   and for taking hold of your responsibility
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.200]   and making enormous progress.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.720]   Congratulations.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.560]   Thank you.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.640]   I appreciate it.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.960]   Listening to you, really, that was a game changer,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.800]   a life changer.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.360]   I'm so glad.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   Thank you.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.160]   If you sold the business today, what business
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.960]   would be your next business that you would go into?
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.760]   So that's part of it.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.560]   That's why I'm not really afraid of holding onto this.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.120]   But it seems like this business just
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.400]   takes so much of my time and energy
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.760]   that because I have computer work
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.100]   I need to do as far as talking to customers
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.360]   and doing things like that, sending out invoices.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.560]   But then that all gets pushed back to evenings
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.000]   after my wife and kids go to bed because I'm out
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.800]   mowing yards all day or helping out with the fertilizer
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.200]   or something like that.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.760]   But I have a couple of different products.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.080]   Again, I love inventing.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.040]   So I have a couple different products,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.880]   some that are involved in the lawn care company
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.680]   space in general that I probably like to start.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.800]   I'm interested more in product companies or knowledge
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.280]   companies rather than, again, the service companies.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.920]   You talked about the other--
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.720]   I haven't honestly thought about this
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.560]   until two weeks ago when you brought it up,
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.760]   I think, on your podcast or three weeks ago about--
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:42.360]   well, now I'm blanking.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.040]   Searching for your next car?
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.280]   Don't settle, thrive.

[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.280]   What do you call it when you buy a company that--
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.600]   or you purchase into a--
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.520]   franchise, franchise.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.640]   Yeah, yeah, I don't know how I blanked on that.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.080]   Franchise, you know, franchising maybe.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.120]   And then again, just investing as well.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.800]   If the company, I could get it to the point
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.640]   where I sell it for $1 or $1.5 million,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.800]   I don't quite know the value of the business as a whole
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.600]   and where I will be in five years.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.120]   But at that point, I'd like to be reinvesting that stuff
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.760]   into real estate, which could take up a lot of time as well.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.200]   Right, OK.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.360]   All right, so let me answer your questions
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:48.000]   and give you a framework to kind of build some things on.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.600]   First and foremost, I don't know what specifically
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   you need to do to your business in Nebraska
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.640]   in order to make it attractive to a potential buyer.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.600]   But you can find that out by looking around in your area
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.080]   and asking yourself, who would buy my business in three years
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.240]   time?
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.400]   And try to figure out who that person would be,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   and then go and talk to that person.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.520]   And I mean actually genuinely go talk to the person.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.160]   I'm glad that you identified the problem being
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.840]   the barrier to entry, because that is exactly the problem.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.400]   The great thing about a lawn care business
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.200]   is simply that anybody with a little hustle
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.120]   can take a Toyota Corolla, put a weed eater and a lawn mower
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.960]   in the trunk, and go up and down the street
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.240]   and find a way to make a living.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.960]   And so a lawn care business is a business
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.760]   that's open to anyone with a little hustle.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.400]   Now the problem is then that that competition is generally
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.520]   going to push down prices, because it's
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.000]   available to anyone.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.080]   If there were some kind of trade cartel that
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.000]   could protect the business against other people coming in
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.880]   and make it hard for people to come in,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:09.760]   like let's say a licensing mechanism for physicians.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.400]   They have a licensing mechanism that
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.120]   makes it really hard to come in.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.720]   And so they have very low competition,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.800]   and they can command much higher wages, obviously, of course,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.880]   the value of the services.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.920]   But things like having a licensing--
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.720]   if you set up a licensing cartel for lawn maintenance,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.120]   and you have to get some kind of government license
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.200]   or some other thing like cosmetology,
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.800]   then now you have fewer people coming into it,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.000]   because there's a protectionist racket there
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.920]   that's keeping it out.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.120]   But in lawn business, you don't have that.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.800]   So this is your fundamental problem.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.440]   Now the question is, who's going to buy the business?
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.280]   You build a business with, say, 500 accounts or 100 accounts.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.880]   We'll just use 100 accounts.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.760]   And so now you've got 100 accounts
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.640]   that you're working on.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.360]   The guy who would put his lawnmower and weed eater
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.120]   into the trunk of his Toyota Corolla
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.200]   is not going to buy that business.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.040]   Who is going to buy the business?
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.480]   Well, it's going to be somebody with money,
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.920]   and it's going to be somebody who wants to own it.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.660]   So the person with money, generally speaking,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.240]   the only people with money who are
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.480]   going to want to buy a business like the one that you've built
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.160]   is going to be somebody who already has a preexisting
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.040]   connection to the industry.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   I'm not going to come and buy your business,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.680]   because I would just say, well, I could build my own
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.920]   if I wanted to.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.720]   And I'm not going to spend a lot of money on buying a business
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.220]   unless I'm already in that industry,
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.960]   because there's a relatively low barrier to entry.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.440]   Anyone can get into it.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.200]   But there's going to be companies or other business
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.000]   owners who are in your area who are in an aggressive growth
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.720]   mode and have money and are looking to expand.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.800]   Those are the ones who are likely to buy your business.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.720]   So you need to think about who that person would be.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.120]   There's probably only a couple dozen of them in your area.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.720]   And go figure out how to make some contacts with whosoever
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.760]   is involved in those businesses.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   And make it clear that I've got this business.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.800]   I'm looking around to see who might want to buy the business.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.440]   And I figure you guys might be people who kind of do that.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.180]   Have you ever bought a business before?
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.640]   There are people out there who will buy businesses.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.320]   Now, I worked in lawn maintenance.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.200]   And what happened is the guy that I worked for when
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.840]   I was young, he just eventually sold his business
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.000]   to one of his competitors.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.440]   And that's probably how things work,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.000]   because you need to find some guy who's
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.520]   kind of at the stage of a business
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.680]   where he's got enough money.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.480]   He's got the crews.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.960]   He's got things.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.080]   And he wants to quickly acquire accounts so that he
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.680]   can increase his scale.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.400]   Now, you may also look around and say, well,
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.480]   is there a corporate entity that's doing this?
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.980]   And this is where you'll start to think about differentiation.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.400]   You mentioned things like fertilizer and pest control.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.200]   That's a distinct-- that's a significant difference
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.800]   from the guy with his pickup truck and lawnmower
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.040]   in the back of the truck.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.120]   That now you can appeal to a larger company.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.720]   You may have more commercial accounts.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.480]   You may have higher end accounts.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.540]   And that may be the kind of thing
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.120]   that you can do with your business that
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.640]   makes it more attractive to a large company.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.880]   If you're in that space, look around and see,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.920]   is there a business broker that's
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.360]   doing business in this space?
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.800]   And go talk to the business broker.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.680]   Introduce yourself.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.880]   Tell them about your business.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.320]   And get some advice on what you can
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.920]   be doing to make your business the most attractive to people
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.600]   in your area.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.920]   Because a lot of this stuff is very much area-based.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.840]   And that's your first thing, is get the real,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.960]   on-the-ground information from those people.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.080]   With regard to questions one and three,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.040]   as far as the structure of the business
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.920]   and then the milestones to make it more desirable,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.200]   I don't know without knowing the people in that space.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.240]   So it may be that the only thing you're basically
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.320]   going to be paid for is the number of accounts.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.520]   It may be that all that matters is size.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.240]   And if you find that out from a business broker,
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.440]   then you now know that this differentiation
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.520]   that I'm trying to do of doing additional services
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.120]   is not serving the end goal of creating
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.400]   the business that's saleable.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.600]   If I'm just going to be paid based upon the bare number
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.640]   of accounts, and that's going to be the key metric,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.360]   then your goal is just to go out and get
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.400]   as many accounts as possible.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.800]   On the other hand, if it is going
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.200]   to be based upon the specialty services and the fact
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.760]   that you have these higher-profit businesses in place,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.360]   then now you would focus on maximizing those.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.400]   So the long-term structure of the business
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.080]   and the question regarding the milestones
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.720]   to make it more desirable could only
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.200]   be answered when you can identify the specific company
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.440]   that is likely to purchase the company
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.840]   and then think about what would be attractive to them.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   Now, there are a number of things
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.880]   that any business can do that make it more saleable.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.040]   So you should always do these things,
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.280]   and they are the necessary things to do along the way.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.600]   Number one, have good, organized financial records
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.640]   that are up-to-date, that are accurate, and that are clear.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.920]   And the earlier you can get good financial controls in place
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.600]   and keep them in place, the better,
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.480]   so that you can inspire higher levels of confidence
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.000]   in your prospective buyers.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.400]   Having a business that's run efficiently,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.760]   so that there's a higher profit margin,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.520]   is likely going to inspire confidence
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.000]   in a prospective buyer.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.840]   I don't know about things like equipment,
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.400]   how that actually works out in the long run.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.120]   But at the very least, you should
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.640]   make certain that whatever equipment and business things
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.800]   are that you have in place are maintained
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.760]   in the best possible condition, so you
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.920]   get the highest long-term resale value
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.320]   and valuation in the sale.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.800]   You should also think about your documentation
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.320]   and think about your staffing.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.040]   Because if somebody comes in and buys this kind of business,
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.800]   having employees who have been with you for a long time, who
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.960]   are relatively well-run, having a good training program,
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.880]   just having a business that is properly documented
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.560]   with good employee training programs, good recruitment
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.240]   programs, things like that, is going to be a big deal.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.240]   And then when we get to things of diversity of services,
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.480]   I don't know how that stuff shakes out in the long term.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.240]   But think about those factors as you're talking with people.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.000]   When is the right time to sell your business?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.200]   I would say the right time to sell your business
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.000]   is when you have an idea of the next thing
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.920]   that you can move to.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.400]   And you can see that you can't do both at the same time.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.240]   So if the next thing that you want to move to
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.800]   is investing in real estate, and what that means
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.360]   is I'm going to buy a house, one house per year,
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.320]   and shop around for it, finance it, fix it up little by little,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.560]   well, you can obviously keep this business
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.000]   and buy a house per year or a house every two years.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.800]   And you can become a real estate investor using that pathway.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.840]   On the other hand, if you have a clear plan for a new business
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.000]   that is markedly different, and you can't do that new business
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.800]   without capital or without time, then
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.280]   that would be a good indication that it's time to go ahead
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.320]   and sell the business.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.840]   And what you should do is you should
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:25.120]   get some form of valuation for your current business,
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.560]   ideally by a real prospective customer or a real business
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   broker who sold a business like yours before.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.920]   Figure out what the multiple, if it's
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.480]   going to be a revenue or earnings multiple,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.080]   figure out what the multiple would
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.760]   be for your kind of business, and then
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.600]   look and see what this business could
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.840]   grow to over the next three or four or five years.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.440]   So if you find out that the multiple is very small,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.640]   as I'm guessing it is compared to many other kinds
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.280]   of businesses, if you find out that the multiple is very
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.400]   small, and you figure I could grow this thing by 20%
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   in the next three years, which would be a good growth rate,
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   but it's a 20% increase on a small number,
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.240]   but you have an alternative business that
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.360]   could go to double the multiple, because it's
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.120]   a different industry, and it has potential for a 50% growth
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.800]   rate, then now you would clearly want
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.080]   to move faster away from this business,
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.040]   because you've discovered the weaknesses of this business,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.760]   and you've discovered the strengths of another business.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.400]   So I would say that you want to get
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.240]   an idea of what this business could be worth if you really
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.880]   poured it on five years from now,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.960]   and what an alternative business would be.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.680]   And when you come up with an alternative
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.040]   that you feel confident has a good chance of success,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.360]   that you yourself can execute on,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.160]   and that is superior to what you're doing,
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.880]   then you go ahead and start making plans
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.640]   to actually sell the business.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.840]   Now the good news is, I think almost any asset
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.560]   and any business is always for sale.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.520]   So you probably don't need to do much anything differently
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.960]   in terms of timing, except wait for a buyer to come along.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.280]   If you actually were going to market this with a broker,
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.240]   sign a contract, that would be different.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.680]   But if you were just kind of casually networking
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.640]   within your industry, and especially focusing
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.720]   on meeting the kinds of people who might like to buy
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   the business, and you drop a hint here and there
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.000]   that you'd like to sell the business and move on,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.600]   you can be operating the business effectively now,
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.560]   while also moving on to the next thing.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.040]   What I would say is, don't neglect the lessons
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.880]   that you're learning.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.080]   The most valuable thing about this business
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.040]   is because it's straightforward,
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.320]   you've been able to learn these lessons
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.120]   step by step along the way.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.560]   And if you can't fix the problems of the business,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.560]   you have to ask yourself, are the problems that I'm facing
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.520]   due to the basic inherent nature of the business itself,
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.920]   or are they due to a personal area of incompetence?
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.800]   So if I'm having trouble finding, attracting,
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   and retaining good quality employees
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.160]   who are gonna come to work and show up on time,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.520]   is that something that is fundamentally due
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.400]   to the actual business or the industry?
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.600]   Or is that due to my incompetence
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.040]   at creating an attractive job,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.000]   recruiting high quality candidates,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.040]   and training them so that they want to stay with me?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.440]   I'm not saying which it is, but if it's the latter,
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.840]   then you wanna focus on saying,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.800]   what could I do to improve this,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.880]   and learn the lessons from it?
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.520]   'Cause whatever the next business that you go to,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.000]   good chance all these same problems
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.920]   that you have right now are still gonna be with you.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.440]   Let me pause for a moment
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.880]   before I go on to your other questions.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.640]   Does that make sense conceptually?
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.360]   - Yes, 100%.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.760]   And I actually already have a guy,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.060]   now that you've said all that,
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.840]   I don't know why I didn't ask him in the first place,
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.120]   I've got a guy in my church
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.520]   that has a really big landscape company,
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.240]   and he's actually purchased a fertilizer company
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.000]   in the past, so that'd be perfect to talk to him.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.360]   - Perfect. - Yep, 100%.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.400]   - And if you've got that guy,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.620]   ask him for other people like him who have also done that.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.120]   So remember that the secret to breaking into a network
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.840]   is usually just finding that initial toehold.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   You may only know one person,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.920]   but he probably knows another person or two that does it.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.960]   And so if you're genuinely asking for advice from him,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.760]   it's not a difficult thing for him to say,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.320]   oh, here, call my other friend here,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.440]   he's done it too, and he can also help you out.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.500]   With regard to the building of solid place to work from,
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.040]   that's gonna depend on the timeline of the business.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.700]   Generally speaking, it's always smart to buy real estate
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.860]   that your business is in.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.620]   That's a good thing, because you've got a good tenant,
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.100]   you can keep an eye on things,
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.700]   and if you can make the finances work,
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.580]   then you can get the best of both worlds,
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:41.260]   because you have the income and the growth in asset value,
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.780]   and then it's a good way that allows you
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.800]   to later just sell the business, but keep the real estate.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.660]   The only distinction would be if you might need
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.540]   that capital for a new business.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.340]   So what would be a mistake would be,
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.080]   I'm gonna go and buy a real estate for this business,
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.540]   but 12 months from now, I sell the business,
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.700]   but I sank my life savings into buying that building,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.220]   and now I need those life savings
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.380]   to start the new business.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.020]   Better to start the new business in a rented facility
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.140]   so that you can get the business going,
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.560]   rather than to make the mistake
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.460]   of purchasing real estate too soon.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.220]   But if you've got a five-year timeline,
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.300]   or whatever the timeline is to the sale of the business,
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.900]   and you see a property that would be appropriate,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.180]   then I would say, sure,
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.860]   move in the direction of selling the business.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.020]   And then the other question you said,
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.400]   as far as what is the right time in my life,
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.380]   the answer goes back to what I said,
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.300]   what's the next opportunity?
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.620]   If you know that this is not the business
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.140]   that I want to have 10 years from now,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.860]   then it's a limited time business.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.740]   And so the right time in your life to go for it
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.380]   is as quickly as you can find the next business,
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.820]   and as quickly as you can develop the personal ability
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.260]   to deal with that next business.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.580]   So you may need to do this one for three more years
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.980]   so you can stockpile capital,
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.500]   'cause the next business requires more capital.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.540]   But it'll all just be based upon,
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.800]   can you find the next thing,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.500]   and what do you need to make the next business go?
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.900]   - Sure, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.100]   So if I were to purchase, say, a shop for this business,
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.900]   is there a way that I should purchase it
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.780]   so that I can keep it in my personal possession
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.860]   and rent it out to, say, the company that buys
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.260]   the actual business itself?
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.900]   Or can I just purchase that as my business,
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.300]   and when I sell it, I say, "Hey, this is excluded,"
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.200]   or how does that work?
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.420]   - You can do any of the above.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.640]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.980]   So the name that's on the title
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.460]   doesn't matter all that much.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.780]   It's basically the same almost any way you do it.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.620]   Ordinarily, if you have a business that's operating,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.020]   ordinarily you would want to separate the operating business
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.540]   from the asset ownership entity.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.180]   So it would be ordinarily smarter
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.860]   not to put the ownership of the building
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:58.860]   into the same company that has liability
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.040]   because you have significant liability to your employees,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.700]   you're operating dangerous equipment,
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.700]   you're doing things that could create
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.220]   lifelong hearing damage and lifelong injuries
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.500]   and things like that.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.220]   So if this building is owned by the company
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.280]   and you are negligent as a company owner,
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.140]   one of your employees sues you,
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.960]   well then because the building is an asset of the company,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.740]   all of the assets of the company
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.860]   are exposed to the claims of the creditor.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.700]   So ordinarily you would want to separate that ownership
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.780]   and you would put it into either your personal name
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.420]   or you would put it into a separate entity.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.620]   If we're talking about a significant purchase,
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.140]   I would always just put it into a separate entity.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.500]   However, if it turns out that you do,
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.140]   for whatever reason for right now,
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.800]   have it in the business and you go to sell the business,
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.960]   you can cut it out at that point in time
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.120]   and just adjust and say,
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.080]   well the business is for sale but not the property
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.320]   and then move the property.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.180]   Changing title is not that difficult to do.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.360]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.560]   Thank you so much, I appreciate it.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.520]   - My pleasure.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.840]   We go on to Tim in Indiana.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.680]   Tim, welcome to the show.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.880]   How can I serve you today?
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.960]   - Hi, this is sort of a thinking like a wealthy person
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.360]   or thinking like you plan to be wealthy question.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.420]   Your last Q&A, you answered the question
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.060]   about affording a car.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.540]   And the big lesson was like, don't get into the weeds
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.180]   and like not let little things take big energy.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.020]   So like the question, what investment can I make
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.140]   to pay for a car indefinitely versus like,
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.600]   how do I save up for a car?
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.140]   I really love that question 'cause it reframed reality
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.100]   and sort of broadened the scope of what I'm focusing on
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.740]   and what I'm comparing to.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.580]   So personally, I grew up in like a humble,
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.260]   middle class household.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.080]   I had one pair of shoes upbringing
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.120]   and it's been hard to shake this scarcity mindset
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.360]   and I've always kind of struggled with thinking bigger
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.400]   and just been scratching and clawing my way
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.560]   out of that ingrained mindset.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.600]   And knowing that you didn't grow up particularly wealthy
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.800]   and we have similar proclivities
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.960]   and personalities I've seen.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.160]   Do you have any other ways to reframe your thinking
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.560]   or mind hacks that kind of get you to think about things
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.580]   in a radical way that really shift the mindset
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.420]   from like middle class mindset to wealthy mindset
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.820]   or even books that do that?
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.060]   - Great question.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.740]   I would say a lot of it is just due to exposure
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.180]   and this is where we're so, I'm so grateful
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.580]   to be able to live in the modern world
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.260]   because we can change the kinds of people
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.500]   we're exposed to very easily.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.860]   If you and I went back a century,
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.660]   we would be living in our local town
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.520]   and the people that we would know
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.440]   would be those who were in our area.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.800]   We would know our neighbors,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.560]   we would know our friends from school,
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.980]   we would know the parents of our friends from school,
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.720]   we might know some people from church,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.160]   maybe a local community organization of some kind
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.800]   and then the people from work.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.760]   And so at that time we had in daily life,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.960]   we had a very closed connection
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.600]   that was usually based upon social class,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.620]   ethnicity, neighborhood, whatever it happened to be.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.500]   If we wanted to get out of that,
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.660]   then we would have to go to books.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.780]   And so we would need to go to the library,
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.140]   go to a bookstore, find a book written by somebody
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.700]   with a different experience, a different perspective
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.620]   and then buy the book and gain
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.060]   from that person's knowledge and experience.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.140]   Thankfully, that's something that's always been available
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.740]   to people to do and those who have done it
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.100]   have gained exposure to a different way of thinking,
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.380]   different ideas, different philosophies.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.040]   Challenge back then though,
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.880]   was simply that publishing at that time was very expensive
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.600]   and there were lots and lots of gatekeepers.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.360]   So the gatekeepers were a positive thing,
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.200]   generally speaking,
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.660]   because if you're gonna have your book published,
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.860]   then it's gotta pass through an editorial review process,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.020]   it's probably not gonna be all lies,
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.020]   it's just some lies or mostly lies, but not all lies,
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.500]   because there's gonna be an editorial review process.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.820]   And the publishing company is taking some responsibility
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.380]   for the book, so there's gonna be some vetting,
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.980]   some fact checking, some due diligence done on the book.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.180]   But because writing was so time consuming,
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.280]   it was hard, it was a big undertaking
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.680]   that required somebody with significant motivation
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.700]   to follow through, write the book, get it published,
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.300]   to get it into your hands.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.980]   Fast forward to today.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.780]   Today, we're all publishers.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.300]   Every person in the world can publish something
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.740]   in some format extremely easily.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.980]   The downside of that is that
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.900]   there aren't so many qualified gatekeepers.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.620]   And so without an editorial review process
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.040]   and without fact checkers,
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.460]   we wind up having a hard time
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.420]   discerning high quality information
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.220]   from low quality information.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.340]   And this is why there's so many frauds and hucksters
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.300]   and just all kinds, it's very challenging to figure it out.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.740]   So we have to develop some skills
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.540]   to be able to sift good advice from bad advice
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.620]   and honest people from dishonest people,
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.300]   all of that is important.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.120]   On the flip side, we can gain access and insight
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.700]   into all kinds of people's stories.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.440]   And this is to me,
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.680]   one of the most valuable things in the world,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.140]   that you can go and you can find somebody
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.700]   who is similar to you, but slightly ahead,
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.780]   and you can hear from that person directly,
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.940]   you can learn from the lessons that person is sharing,
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.220]   and you can allow that person to shape
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.940]   and adjust your thinking.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.300]   And that's an amazing opportunity.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.060]   I think that it's best to look for somebody
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.880]   who is somewhat near you, but just a little bit ahead,
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.180]   or a good bit ahead, but not unreachably ahead.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.460]   If you go, for example, and you say,
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.060]   I'm gonna go and read all of the essays
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.100]   written by the King of England, if there are any,
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.900]   that's gonna be very hard for you to relate to.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.540]   But if you go and you find somebody
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.020]   who makes 50% more money than you do,
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.660]   or who lives in your area,
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.120]   but has a different mindset around wealth,
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.220]   then you'll find that to be more relatable.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.580]   So that's what I would counsel,
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.820]   is look for people who are similar in experience to you,
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.620]   but ahead of where you want to be,
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.520]   and start to follow their advice.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.380]   There's just been such a profusion,
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:21.140]   an absolute flourishing publishing industry,
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.220]   that all kinds of people now,
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.660]   with genuine, real, valuable advice in a niche,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.380]   are now able to publish that easily to the internet.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.420]   And we're surrounded by just an embarrassment of riches
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.340]   in almost any area.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.260]   So I would just say, go look for someone who's in that.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.380]   Now, where we could go from here,
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.340]   and I don't know that I could do this extemporaneously,
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:43.580]   but what we could do is start to compose a list of goals,
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.140]   of the kinds of things that we would want to look for.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.180]   So the person who might be well-suited
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.580]   to give good career advice,
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.940]   may be someone who is very poorly suited
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.980]   to give good family advice.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.120]   And the person who gives good religious advice,
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.020]   may be somebody who is very bad
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.740]   at giving good travel advice.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.580]   And so we would want to think about the different areas
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.180]   that we want to make progress in,
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.280]   and then choose, in essence, a mentor or two,
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.220]   in that area that we can look up to,
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.220]   and learn from along the way.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.300]   And then just don't be scared to swap them out.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.980]   I think the normal pathway of progression,
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.740]   at least the way that I consume advice,
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.780]   is I find somebody who has something that I want,
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.980]   I listen to that person,
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.260]   and I work to integrate everything that I can.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.500]   But usually after a few years,
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.980]   unless that person himself or herself
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.260]   is continuing to grow aggressively,
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.300]   usually that becomes a little stale,
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.300]   and I reach a different point in life.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.760]   And so then I need to go out and find some new mentors
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.700]   who have some new life experience.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.180]   And that doesn't mean that the previous mentors were wrong,
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.580]   or that there was some kind of error about them.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.260]   They were fine for what I needed at the time.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.460]   So it's perfectly fine to consume
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.980]   what's helpful from one person,
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.380]   and then swap that person out for someone different
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.380]   when you reach a different point in life.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:05.860]   - Okay, okay, that makes sense.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.660]   Well, I won't be swapping you out anytime soon, Joshua.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.500]   - Well, thank you.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.420]   I try to keep growing, and so hopefully that comes through.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.360]   But I appreciate that.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.900]   But I actually, I think many people will swap me out,
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.380]   and that's totally fine.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.980]   But I do try to stay ahead of the curve,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.100]   and that's one of the reasons I try to share
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.340]   as pointedly as possible
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:30.340]   when and how my experiences have changed,
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.400]   when and how my positions have changed.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.940]   Because I think that growth is the natural course
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.620]   of a man's life.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.580]   He should be growing.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.660]   I should be different at 40 than I was at 20.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.080]   And as long as we recognize that and are honest with it,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.560]   then it will work.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.600]   One more comment on the concept of scarcity mindset.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   I'm very uncomfortable with this term,
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.280]   though I quickly acknowledge that it is useful.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.520]   The reason I'm comfortable with the term
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.640]   is I've very rarely done well
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.940]   with psychological commitments
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.300]   to try to screw up a belief in something
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.640]   that is not backed by reality.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.880]   And so I can recognize and identify the fact that,
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.560]   hey, I've got a scarcity mindset.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.540]   But I've always had a tough time
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.840]   with the way that people often apply
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.760]   the concept of the strangest secret
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.340]   or the idea of just believing in something
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.000]   that will happen in the future.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.640]   I find that that, at least for me,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.840]   sets a foundation of dishonesty,
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.440]   that I'm lying to myself.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.160]   I'm lying to myself of the fundamental,
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.720]   who is the one person in the world
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.280]   that I don't want to lie to.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.440]   So I'm not about to sit around and say,
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.840]   I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich,
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.560]   when in reality I'm poor.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.080]   I think the way that you overcome a scarcity mindset
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.240]   is by eliminating the scarcity through good, solid actions.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.560]   And then as time goes by, you talk with people
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.380]   and you identify one particular change in thinking
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.420]   that can be a helpful way to improve something.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.560]   And the only way to eliminate,
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.800]   or a way to eliminate the scarcity mindset
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.160]   is to identify one or two things
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.680]   that are illogical and focus on something else
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.040]   to replace them with.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.620]   And so I've worked with a number of private clients
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.040]   on this topic over many years,
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.640]   and I've seen it in my own space as well.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.400]   And that's one of the reasons I try to bring out
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.200]   basically the frame of scale to all conversations.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.160]   If you, for example, by scarcity mindset,
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.400]   you're referring to something like frugality.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.440]   There is a truth about frugality
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.920]   that is applied at every level.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.080]   So what I reject, for example,
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.620]   is somebody who says, you know, I grew up poor,
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.640]   I'm poor right now, I don't earn very much money,
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.640]   I don't have very much money, but I just read "The Secret",
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.960]   so I'm gonna sit here and just imagine the future.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.760]   And by the way, I may be unfairly pillorying "The Secret",
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.340]   I haven't read it actually.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.420]   So if I'm mischaracterizing it, please forgive me.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.820]   I make fun of it because it's become a meme in our culture,
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.820]   and when I hear people talk about it,
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.820]   they see it as just basically
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.820]   trying to instill a belief system.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.460]   Obviously, psychocybernetics is obviously
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.220]   an important component of life,
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.640]   and so instilling a belief system can be necessary,
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.660]   but it's not a sufficient condition for significant change.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.100]   It may be a necessary first condition,
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.280]   but it's not a sufficient condition.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.240]   So anyway, back to the point.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.620]   So let's say that I'm poor, and I don't have any money,
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.420]   I don't know anybody with money,
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.060]   and I realize I have a scarcity mindset.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.140]   Well, the first thing to do is to be honest and say,
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.740]   I'm broke, I don't have any money, I gotta change this.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.460]   And I start having money.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.740]   And so the first thing to do is to start saving money.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.420]   - Searching for your next car?
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.640]   Don't settle, thrive.

[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.360]   - In order to save money, I need to be frugal.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.880]   So I go, and if I have a low income,
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   the expression of frugality is that I'm gonna go
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.880]   get my clothes from a thrift store,
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.420]   I'm gonna shop for my food on the discount sale price,
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.300]   and I'm gonna do all of the things
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.920]   that are kind of coupon cutting
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.820]   and all of the expressions of that
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.900]   that are low-hanging fruit for frugality.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.520]   And that's important because if I do that,
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.460]   then I can drive a wedge into my income
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.860]   and I can start saving money.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.300]   And now as I save money,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.180]   I'll actually have a little bit of money.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.500]   Fast forward a few years.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.940]   If I've been able to take that money,
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.800]   invest the money, increase my income
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.540]   by applying things I learned about increasing my income,
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.700]   I still have to be frugal.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.420]   I just may not have to be frugal
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.540]   specifically with the area of clothes,
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.100]   whether I buy them at the thrift store or I buy them new.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.220]   I'll still be frugal though
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.620]   with the kind of vehicle that I purchase.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.500]   I'll still be frugal with the kind of house that I live in.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.700]   But fast forward a decade, and all of a sudden now,
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.140]   the car, the kind of car that I drive now doesn't matter
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.860]   'cause I can drive anything, but I still have to be frugal.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.080]   It's just that I have to be frugal
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.600]   with other consumption items
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.640]   or other kinds of business decisions.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.400]   So frugality is a necessary virtue at all levels of wealth.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.780]   But what frugality means changes
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.360]   based upon the scale of where someone is.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.040]   And this is why I say what I said
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.200]   about trying to find someone
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.800]   who is just a little bit ahead of you.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.880]   Because what is necessary when you're very broke
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.480]   is not necessary when your income has doubled,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.200]   but you're gonna be in a totally different place
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.220]   when the income is four times from now.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.500]   And since you can't know what those things are,
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.380]   it's safest to consume some advice
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.340]   from someone who's a little bit ahead of you
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.100]   for say 80% of the time,
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.860]   and then make sure that you consume the advice
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.340]   of someone who's way, way ahead for the other 20%.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.540]   Because it could be that there's some big jumps
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.940]   to be able to be made.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.980]   And so I wanna emphasize honesty and honesty to myself
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:29.020]   and recognize that if I've got a scarcity mindset,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.520]   it may be because resources are scarce.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.200]   And that's a very different conversation
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.160]   than somebody who has abundant resources
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.300]   but still has the mindset.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.380]   We can fix that in a few weeks or a couple months.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.920]   But if the scarcity mindset is from genuine scarcity,
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.680]   the key is get rid of the scarcity.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.080]   - Yeah, maybe I can narrow the scope a little bit.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.960]   You just hit on it.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.560]   I grew up having to fix everything
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.400]   because you certainly couldn't buy anything new.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.720]   And like the other day, I spent four hours
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.800]   fixing our vacuum, where I look back,
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   I'm like, wow, looking at my hourly rate,
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.720]   I should have just gone and bought a vacuum.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.000]   Or like, do I mow the lawn every week
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.080]   or do I pay someone else?
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.540]   It's like that level of,
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.920]   it's almost like breaking the habit.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.360]   - So let's explore that for just a moment.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.280]   When, what day of the week did you fix the vacuum?
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.120]   - It was on the weekend, like a Saturday.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.000]   - If you hadn't been fixing the vacuum,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.360]   what would you have been doing with your time?
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.520]   - Probably thinking of ways to improve my small business
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.440]   or ways to optimize what I have already.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.520]   - Okay, so the key for making one of these decisions
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.360]   is the opportunity cost.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.520]   If you had instead spent four hours
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.760]   working on improving your small business,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.080]   but instead of doing that, you went and fixed the vacuum,
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.000]   then at least financially,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.840]   you should have not fixed the vacuum.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.160]   You should have just gone and bought a new one.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.520]   Now, we could talk about enjoyment
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.280]   'cause a lot of times,
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.040]   some guy may enjoy fixing the vacuum.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.800]   Puts on the baseball game in the background
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.440]   and sits down and works on the vacuum
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.320]   and it's something that's genuinely enjoyable.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.680]   And so if something is enjoyable,
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.800]   then we don't just cut it out
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.160]   just because we can make more money doing something else.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.560]   But if your business could gain
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.100]   from additional time spent on the business,
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.320]   on planning, on preparing,
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.280]   on whatever the associated business activities are,
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.840]   if it could gain from that
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.560]   and you're choosing not to do that
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.900]   by doing a low-value activity,
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.560]   then that is an error.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.420]   And so you should engage in some methodology
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.120]   to identify where those time leaks are
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.840]   and where those low-value activities are
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.140]   because in the fullness of time,
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.400]   for you to reach your financial goals,
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.880]   you have to commit the resource you have,
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.720]   which is time, to high-value activities.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.640]   And if you have ambitious financial goals,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.800]   you're not going to reach those ambitious financial goals
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.920]   by doing low-value activities.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.740]   So you have to embrace the specialization of labor
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.700]   and embrace the fact that I have the capacity now
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.960]   to do high-returning labor
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.060]   and I want to do as much of that as I can.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.400]   So that one's a little tricky.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.520]   It probably deserves a podcast in and of itself
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.120]   with lots of episodes,
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.400]   excuse me, with lots of expansions and examples.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   But it's not as simple as just to say,
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.120]   well, I could do more of that
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.720]   because sometimes you can't.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.800]   Sometimes you're just worn out and you need a break,
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.840]   in which case there's no reason to spend money
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.160]   if instead you can fix it yourself.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.840]   But if you genuinely would have gone
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.960]   and worked on your business
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.420]   and if that would have been a higher-returning investment,
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.120]   then yes, it was a mistake for you to focus
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.760]   on fixing the vacuum instead of going and doing that.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:45.280]   - Okay, okay.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.440]   - All right.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.120]   - That makes sense.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.560]   And it probably makes it more difficult
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.120]   to pay somebody to mow the lawn
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.520]   when all the neighbors mow their own lawns.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.880]   So I guess it makes sense when you're like,
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.920]   find somebody who is making 50% more
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.920]   'cause they're likely not in the same neighborhood.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:01.880]   - Right, right.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.920]   And remember, there's always a good way to do it, right?
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.720]   Find a kid who needs a summer job and pay him handsomely
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.360]   so that he can get the start on it.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.640]   There's always a way to justify the stuff
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.620]   in a way that's gonna make it feel good for you.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.800]   Let me just give you two quick exercises that will help.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.320]   Number one, take your annual income goal
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.380]   and break it down to an hourly rate.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:26.560]   So let's say your annual income goal is $200,000 per hour.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.480]   Excuse me. (laughs)
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.760]   Excuse me.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.880]   - Okay.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.360]   - We'll take, yeah, that would be great.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.200]   - Done.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.420]   - So $200,000 per year, right?
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.740]   Divide that into 52 weeks and then divide that by 40.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:44.160]   So $200,000 a year is an hourly rate of $96.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.720]   Now, what we can do basically is just round this up.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.640]   $100 an hour is $200,000 a year.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.600]   $500 an hour is a million dollars a year.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.880]   So I don't know how to explain that math,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.840]   but you probably got it by now.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.420]   You basically just double it and add some zeros
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.260]   and you're there.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.880]   So $40 an hour work gives you 80,000 a year,
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.240]   basically speaking.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.840]   So figure out what your annual income goal is.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.520]   And if your annual income goal is $200,000,
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.120]   then you need to be doing $100 an hour work.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.820]   And so every hour that you don't do $100 an hour work
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.440]   is keeping you from reaching your annual income goal.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.440]   So if you can go and you can pay someone else $50
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.520]   to do the things that you would be doing,
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.240]   and instead you can go and do $100 an hour work,
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.460]   then you're on the right track
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.600]   because you're focusing on the high value work.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.160]   If the opportunity cost is,
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.340]   oh, I'm gonna pay these guys $50 an hour,
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.200]   but what I'll do instead is just sit around and do nothing
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.280]   and not active rest or whatever,
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.480]   then you're better off doing the $50 an hour work
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.640]   because it's additive rather than replacing
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.360]   the other work that you would do.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.240]   But figure out what your hourly rate needs to be
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.200]   for your own personal financial goal.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.000]   Then come back to the actual activity and ask yourself,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.760]   is this $100 an hour work?
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.580]   And if you discipline yourself to always be focusing on,
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.960]   I need to do $100 an hour work,
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.420]   then you'll be in a situation where systematically
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.480]   as you do more $100 an hour work,
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.440]   you will in the fullness of time reach the $200,000 goal.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.660]   So it will work in the fullness of time.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.360]   Hope that helps and keep in touch.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.400]   Let's talk about it in the coming months.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.640]   Daniel in Texas, welcome to the show.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.880]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.720]   - Thanks, Josh.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.540]   How are you doing today?
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.380]   - Very well, sir.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.480]   Thank you.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.720]   - Good.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.740]   So my root question is,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.800]   what is the value of just learning a skill
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.640]   for having the skill?
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.000]   Even if you're not sure that the skill
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.560]   directly points you in the direction you want to go.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.640]   The details with that is I was,
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.680]   for my day job, I had the chance to start doing
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.440]   some amount of sales kind of on the side.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.080]   I'm in project management, for everyone listening,
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.320]   and I had the chance to kind of take on
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.560]   basically a little extra work on top of my job
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.840]   to do some sales, which would obviously
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.700]   make some extra money would be the plan,
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.080]   and then learn that skill to some degree.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.040]   That worked great for me.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:11.880]   I was happy with it.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.840]   It worked for the family, everything.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.240]   Due to, you know, there's always less money
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.920]   in the giant corporate bank account
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.960]   than they would like there to be,
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.540]   they are asking me to move full-time into sales,
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.120]   forego the old job,
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:31.480]   and just take that on full-time.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.180]   So I know sales is obviously a useful skill.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.920]   I don't look at sales other than as kind of
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.520]   a general thing as being something
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.420]   I would ever want to go into,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.360]   or really have much to do with.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.840]   On the other hand, you have to sell things all the time,
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.600]   so, including yourself.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.920]   So I guess I'm trying to figure out,
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.280]   it doesn't really, it's like,
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.720]   it also, the hard thing, I've worked from home
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.840]   almost all the time now.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.200]   I'm now going to basically be gone five days a week,
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.400]   driving all over creation, which I love that aspect.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.920]   But, yeah.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.800]   - Got it.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.240]   So my first answer is that for the young,
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.040]   learning a skill that you're not necessarily going to use,
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.720]   the value of that is very high.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.240]   For the older, the value of that is lower.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.480]   And this has to do, basically,
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.760]   with what we have in abundance.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.640]   Generally, learning a skill involves time.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.840]   Now, it can involve money, but it generally involves time.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.560]   And for the young, time is more abundant,
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.920]   and money is short.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.560]   As you get older, time becomes shorter,
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.680]   and money usually becomes more abundant.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.920]   And so since we can take money,
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.520]   and we can buy other people's time,
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.960]   the value of learning a particular skill
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.200]   goes down significantly.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.920]   It also goes down because we're more focused,
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:53.060]   and we know ourselves a little bit more
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.780]   to be able to give better direction
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.520]   of what specifically we want to do.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.560]   Now, I'm speaking a little bit generally,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.040]   but this is kind of a good general outline,
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.520]   I think, to say.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.400]   So let's say that, let's put teeth on this.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.200]   Let's say that I'm running a business as a teenager,
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.520]   and I need to create a website.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.240]   Well, I could go and buy a website.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.480]   I could just go to any website providers,
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.060]   and that would be perfectly reasonable.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:24.080]   But if I sit down, and I create the website myself,
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.080]   and I use it as a chance to develop a skill,
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.500]   I'll probably, I will have that skill now
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.540]   for the rest of my life.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.560]   And since time is abundant,
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.880]   and there's probably not a lot more useful
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.040]   than doing that skill, let me go ahead and do that.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.920]   And I may discover all kinds of things
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.560]   that I can use later in life,
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   because now I understand the website at a better level.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.460]   But now if I'm a lawyer, and I'm 45 years old,
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.960]   and I need a new website,
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   it's very difficult for me to imagine
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.440]   ever advising someone like that
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.200]   to sit down and create your own website.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.900]   It would be a very, very high cost of doing that.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.080]   So think about time versus money.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.860]   In addition, we have to recognize
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.300]   that not all skill acquisition
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.880]   falls into an economic framework.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.680]   And so there are many good reasons
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.000]   to accumulate skills outside of economics,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.920]   and we just judge those by a different metric.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.000]   You're asking a basically economic question,
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.100]   but let's acknowledge that I may really enjoy calligraphy,
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.760]   because it's an art form, and I'll never make money on it,
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.940]   but if I like doing calligraphy,
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.620]   then sure, it's valuable to go build the skill.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.680]   I use that example,
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.520]   because it's the famous example, though,
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.080]   to show that sometimes skills that we develop
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.680]   that are not related to our current business
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.920]   can wind up being useful down the road.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.640]   The calligraphy example is famous,
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.440]   because Steve Jobs took a calligraphy class in college,
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.080]   and then used the idea of being keyed in
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.600]   or clued into design as something
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.520]   that ultimately impacted the whole design culture
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.600]   related to Apple computer.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.680]   And that high design culture became a core component
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.680]   of the company's identity and the success of the products.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.280]   Jobs never did that strategically,
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.600]   but it's a good example of the serendipitous nature of life
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.600]   that we can learn something and move on.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.800]   Now, to scale, to sales.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.680]   I would say sales is one of those core skills
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.120]   that everybody who has it
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.680]   has something that's enormously valuable.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.660]   And I think it's one of those core skills
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.680]   that probably everyone should have to some degree.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.660]   And because of the high return on investment,
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.720]   it's worth learning, even if it's not a long-term endeavor.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.860]   When I went into the insurance business
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.660]   and started selling life insurance,
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.260]   I did it because I wanted to learn how to sell.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.180]   And I didn't, in fact, end up sticking with that business,
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:50.020]   even though I'm in a related business currently.
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.060]   But I'm very grateful for the experiences
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.500]   that I gained from that business,
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.200]   because learning how to sell effectively
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.340]   is something that has given me enormous confidence in life.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:02.860]   And when I talk about developing skills,
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.660]   at least when I do coaching on my career planning,
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.980]   I talk about economically valuable skills.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.900]   And selling is one of those core things.
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.380]   I built this model years ago
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.820]   when I read Joshua Kaufman's book, "The Personal MBA."
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.140]   And in that book, he defines a business very carefully.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.220]   He's gonna talk about business.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.820]   He defines a business.
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.660]   And according to his definition,
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.100]   he says, "A business is a repeatable process
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:31.420]   "that one, creates and delivers something of value,
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.680]   "two, that other people want or need,
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.860]   "three, at a price they're willing to pay,
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.700]   "four, in a way that satisfies
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.020]   "the customer's needs and expectations,
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.260]   "and five, so that the business brings in sufficient profit
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.520]   "to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation."
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.360]   Let me repeat that.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.340]   I know it's wordy, but just listen.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.420]   "A business is a repeatable process
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.140]   "that creates and delivers something of value
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.160]   "that other people want or need,
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.140]   "at a price they're willing to pay,
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.580]   "and in a way that satisfies
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.840]   "the customer's needs and expectations,
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.360]   "so that the business brings in sufficient profit
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.100]   "to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation."
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.060]   It doesn't matter whether you're running a solo venture
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.300]   or a billion-dollar brand.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.820]   If you take any of those five things away,
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:17.860]   you don't have a business.
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:19.700]   You've got something completely different.
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:23.020]   So a thing, a venture that doesn't create value for others
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.500]   is a hobby, which is fine.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:25.860]   It's just not a business.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.740]   A venture that doesn't attract attention is a flop.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.980]   A venture that doesn't sell the value it creates
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.260]   is a non-profit.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:35.180]   A venture that doesn't deliver what it promises is a scam.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.940]   And a venture that doesn't bring in enough money
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.720]   to keep operating will inevitably close.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.180]   So that's the core point.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.100]   So since business, every business,
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:48.380]   is fundamentally a collection of these five processes,
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.900]   then these are the five areas to focus
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.060]   when we're thinking about building
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.480]   economically valuable skills.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.060]   So we can put names on them.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.260]   The first one, where a business creates
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.420]   and delivers something of value,
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.140]   we can call that value creation,
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:04.380]   which is discovering what people need, want,
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:08.060]   or could be encouraged to want, and then creating it.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.980]   When we think about a business being a process,
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.180]   creates and delivers something of value
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:14.940]   that other people want or need, that's called marketing.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.060]   Marketing is attracting attention
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:19.660]   and building demand for what you've created.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.500]   At a price they're willing to pay, we can call that sales.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.140]   Turning prospective customers into paying customers
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.720]   by actually consummating a transaction.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.820]   In a way that satisfies the customer's needs
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.580]   and expectations, we call that value delivery.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.320]   Giving your customers what you've promised
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.900]   and ensuring they're satisfied with the transaction
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.780]   so that the business brings in sufficient profit
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.520]   to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation,
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.860]   that's finance, bringing in enough money to keep going
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.980]   and make your effort worthwhile.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:50.220]   So all five of those skillsets are core
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.060]   to all businesses everywhere in the world.
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.360]   And somebody who is skilled or knowledgeable
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.580]   to at least some degree in all five of them
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.100]   is very well suited to do well in business.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.860]   So they are value creation, marketing,
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.780]   sales, value delivery, and finance.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:10.320]   Now, of those, sales itself is really unique
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.180]   because sales has provable value.
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:14.940]   And that's what's so powerful about it.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.860]   A good salesman can go into any market and find a job
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:21.040]   because a salesman by definition can prove
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.900]   that he brings in more money to the company
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.460]   than he costs the company.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.580]   So it's a uniquely valuable skill to have,
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:29.700]   and it's a core skill to all business.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.420]   And so for that reason, it should be very highly prized
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.400]   when there's opportunity to learn it,
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.400]   even though it not be something that you want to do forever.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:43.460]   - Okay, that's helpful.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.060]   That was kind of what I was thinking.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:51.060]   Was it worth it for the sake of learning the thing?
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.460]   Sorry to them also, I'm still trying to figure out
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:59.180]   like there's parts of it where I'm looking at
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.220]   and saying I don't love being taken away from my family
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:04.060]   and want to figure that out long-term.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:09.060]   So I have to figure that aspect out.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.780]   - Those are all important questions and considerations
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.100]   that I couldn't comment on right now.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.660]   Just pointing out that sales itself is uniquely valuable.
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.260]   It's a skill that's fundamental to all business.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.420]   And it's one of those things
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.540]   that at least some experience in sales
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:27.600]   is something that seems like it'll pay off for a lifetime.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:31.540]   How that specifically applies to you, you be the judge.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:35.900]   - Yeah, what is the, I mean, I guess if you were to say,
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:39.220]   hey, this is a useful thing, let's assume it goes fine,
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:40.860]   but I don't love it, whatever.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:43.780]   Where's the point at which you say,
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:47.460]   okay, I've learned this decently.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:51.860]   I feel confident in myself, but not maybe overconfident.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.700]   I'm going to try and now go do the other thing.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.100]   Like I've learned it enough.
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.420]   I'm familiar with it enough.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.060]   When do you move on to the next thing?
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.620]   - I think that one is just what I repeat so frequently
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.060]   is when you know what the better thing is.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.140]   As a man, it's different than the advice
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.900]   that you would have to implement in your life as a man
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.060]   is different than the advice that you would implement
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.780]   in your life as a teen.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.820]   If you're coaching a 14-year-old
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.020]   who has a chance to just go learn sales for three years
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.300]   or two years, you would say,
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.940]   yeah, go learn sales for two or three years.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.620]   You're going to be so glad for the experience, go for it.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.180]   And this is a great thing for teens to do.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.180]   Most people who I've known
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.340]   who've been very successful financially,
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.760]   or at least many, let me be careful with my words,
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.100]   they have some background, right?
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.860]   They sold Cutco knives in college,
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.940]   or they did some kind of network marketing gig,
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.700]   or they did something.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.340]   I had a list of ones that I did,
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.020]   and I'm grateful for those experiences.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.940]   You learn something from all of those experiences.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:59.300]   But for you, time is not so cheap as it is for a teen.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.780]   So if you're going to go into sales,
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.740]   that should be because this is the best opportunity
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.820]   that I have now that moves me down the path
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.840]   towards my vision, whatever it is.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.840]   It's perfectly fine if that vision is just,
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.120]   I can make more money,
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.520]   because I need more money at this point in time.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.240]   But if you have a vision of something
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.800]   that you want to do on the next step from sales,
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.340]   then you move on to that as quickly as you can see it.
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.120]   So we can acknowledge broadly
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.960]   that this is a useful skill that we want to develop,
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.000]   but your time is not cheap.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.720]   And so you should be thoughtful about it.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.680]   It may be that you go into sales here
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.240]   at an opportunity that you have.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.500]   It involves a little travel,
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.920]   but your family can handle it for a time.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   But a year from now,
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.260]   with a year of good sales experience under your belt,
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.920]   now there's a different sales job
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.280]   that takes away the travel
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.120]   or whatever it is that's negative about this,
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.560]   and has a much bigger and better bonus structure
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.720]   and commission structure,
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.280]   where now you can do much better.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.320]   In that case, you would quickly jump to that,
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.040]   and you would get there because you have the opportunity.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.680]   So only move in the direction of sales
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.940]   if it kind of obviously makes sense
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.340]   in terms of your overall career plans.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:13.160]   - Okay, but, and that's, you know, like I'm,
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.120]   yeah, I'm trying not to,
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.480]   time is less than I'm trying to use that well,
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   'cause I'm also in my mid-30s
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.520]   and trying to figure out how to use that time well,
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.080]   and not lose time in the place that I'm at,
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.560]   because things have,
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.140]   I guess, trying to make sure
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.820]   that I'm moving in the right direction
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.940]   and not just learning a bunch of random things,
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:41.200]   and then I'm 50 and I have a bunch of different skills,
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.860]   but never enough time in any one thing
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.580]   to move forward in one industry.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.500]   - Yeah.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.140]   It's frustrating if you don't have a clear strategy.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.300]   So just know that it happens to a lot of people.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.260]   I just finished a biography this week,
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.700]   and it was a biography of this really amazing guy,
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.140]   very smart,
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.500]   but it wasn't until he was almost 50 years old
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.300]   that he had finally put together
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.300]   all of these pieces of his life
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.980]   and realized his unique calling in life.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:13.260]   And his biography was outstanding,
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.620]   and his contribution to the world was enormous,
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.060]   absolutely enormous,
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.580]   and yet it was obvious from just reading his biography
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:25.540]   that it took him a long time to build confidence in himself
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:31.380]   and to have such a diversity of experience
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.660]   that it ultimately came together
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.380]   and where he really left his imprint on the world.
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.020]   So I don't know if it,
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.540]   I don't think it can be forced or hastened.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.860]   Go as far as you see,
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.420]   and then when you get there, there'll be more light.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.420]   If you think that sales is going to destroy your family,
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.620]   don't do it, right?
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:50.020]   Because that's largely irreversible.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:52.720]   But if you think that your family could handle it,
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.500]   and it's strong and it's not too onerous,
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.300]   and it may move you in the direction, then pursue it.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.340]   And it's not wrong.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.180]   There are a couple of, I think, basic metrics
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.500]   that should be adopted.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.340]   Number one, if you get the chance to earn more money,
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.260]   then generally speaking, you should pursue it
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.420]   unless it comes with some unacceptable cost.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.460]   Again, unacceptable risk, loss of life, loss of marriage,
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.360]   loss of children, things like that.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.900]   So if you get the chance to make more money, earn more money.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.020]   If you get the chance to take on more responsibility,
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:20.900]   generally speaking,
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:24.460]   unless it comes with some unacceptable cost, don't do it.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.820]   But every time you go up the ladder
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.740]   of money and responsibility, you gain and you grow,
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.340]   and that's what transforms you
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.820]   into a more powerful man in the fullness of time.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.200]   And then you look back later and see.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.900]   But if sales can be a part of your vision, go for it.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.820]   If it's not, then don't go down that path
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.580]   if you can't see how at least some way
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.060]   it fits into your vision.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.540]   Samuel in Colorado, welcome to the show.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.060]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.740]   - Hello, thank you so much.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.100]   We've spoken recently on career and income topics.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.880]   - I was gonna call this a regular segment, I love it.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.000]   - Yeah, today's shifting slightly from that onto inflation.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.760]   But before I get into that,
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.440]   I was really inspired by the conversation
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.880]   on scarcity mindset.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.640]   And I get my idea of the scarcity mindset
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.480]   from Stephen Covey,
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.120]   Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.320]   And he talks about it very briefly, just one or two pages.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.120]   And he concludes you should not have the scarcity mindset,
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.640]   but he only seems to really address it
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.880]   in a financial context.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.560]   And that's how I think I heard it addressed
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.000]   on the last call.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.680]   So just really quick, I wanted to say,
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.320]   I have a very strong scarcity mindset,
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.520]   but it's mainly in terms of time.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.240]   And you've mentioned the time is scarce as well,
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.700]   but even more so you can see in things like as a skier,
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:42.880]   I may only get one day and one weekend in a whole season
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.040]   where there is incredible powder in Colorado,
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.600]   like 20 inches of powder.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.080]   You may not even get that in a season.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.900]   So there's absolutely a scarcity mindset in my mind.
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.840]   Same thing with rock climbing.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.040]   You know, a willing partner who's not flaky
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.480]   and doesn't bail on you,
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.240]   that aligns with the day with good weather,
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.920]   that's extremely rare.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.280]   So just wanted to hear your thoughts on scarcity mindset
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.640]   outside of finance.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.960]   - Fair question.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:13.480]   I don't know that I have anything profound to say
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.440]   other than to affirm what you're saying.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.360]   At the end of the day,
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.300]   time is the thing that seems to be,
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.920]   at least in our current experience of time,
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.320]   time is the thing that is profoundly limited.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.960]   Now, I believe that someday God will end the system
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.480]   that we have of time,
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.720]   and we will then have an eternal life
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.160]   in which we'll have an entirely different model
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.680]   and a different way of making decisions,
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.240]   and I can't wait to see what those conversations
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.200]   are gonna be.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.240]   Whenever we try to wrap our mind around time
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.120]   and even long-livedness,
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:50.240]   we can't really think without the concept of time.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.240]   It's so fundamental to who we are.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.040]   So as long as we are on this mortal coil,
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.560]   then we need to think continually about time,
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.360]   and to me, that seems to be the ultimate resource
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:05.280]   because it continues forward at a steady pace.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.400]   It does not change, and there's always less of it.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.080]   And so the actual embrace of time is core.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.160]   It's fundamental to what it means to be a productive person.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.720]   Virtually all of my regrets,
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.160]   and I try to avoid too much the feeling of regret,
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.040]   but I try to learn from them,
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.040]   all of my regrets relate in some way to poorly used time.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:34.240]   Other than that, like money, I've wasted plenty of money.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.360]   I don't worry about that
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.920]   because money is ultimately renewable.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.080]   There are other things.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.040]   I don't have many relationship regrets.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.840]   I've generally not experienced,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.640]   I've not done anything really terrible there.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.960]   So there are other regrets, things that can't be changed,
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.840]   but most of my regrets relate to poorly used time.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.120]   And the older I get, the time gets shorter,
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.500]   both actually and perceptively.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.480]   So I feel increasingly this intense pressure
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.600]   to be useful with time.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.360]   And then in my worldview, and I think our shared worldview,
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.120]   I know that ultimately I will be responsible to God himself
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.840]   for how I use the time that he's entrusted to me,
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.560]   and that I have a responsibility to use it
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.680]   in a productive and effective way.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.960]   So I feel that pressure,
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.400]   that kind of consistent need to be good with time.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.000]   Now, what I think you're relating to
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.560]   is something I talk about,
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.380]   and just in terms of things that are time-bound goals
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:38.280]   versus money-bound goals or something else.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.880]   And so if there's something
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:43.260]   that can only be done at certain times,
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.960]   then that should be prioritized.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.200]   And so where you put in amazing powder days
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.240]   or ideal circumstances for rock climbing,
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.040]   someone else might put in a day of great surf,
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.640]   then these are predictably unpredictable things.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.400]   Like you can know sort of when they're gonna come,
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.760]   but when they come, you gotta drop everything and go.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.280]   I would put that into my context
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.640]   of how I think about things like experiences
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.840]   with my children, particular events in their life,
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.840]   and those kinds of things.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.720]   So I'm not going to let something
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.540]   that can be done at any time
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.860]   fall in the way of something
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.980]   that can only be done at certain times.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:22.500]   And so it would be very important,
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.220]   it is in the same way that I structure my life
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.220]   in such a way that I am present for every single moment
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.100]   that I wish to be present for,
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.540]   you would structure your life as you're doing
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.260]   in such a way that when there is good powder, you're there.
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:37.400]   But it doesn't mean then
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.540]   that you can't use the other time effectively,
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.940]   you're just identifying that at this particular weekend,
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.820]   I'm not gonna do this other thing that's important,
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:47.580]   rather, I'm gonna be on the rock face or on the slope.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:52.120]   - Yeah, thank you so much.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.960]   So yeah, circling over to inflation,
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.560]   and I did do a quick search.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.660]   I see you have almost 20 episodes on inflation,
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:04.520]   including one in 2022 on my current economic times.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.440]   I think I've listened to it,
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.280]   but let me know if you've already covered these topics.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.360]   But inflation in regards to a retirement plan,
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.400]   so it's vaguely related to my earlier calls,
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.920]   but I think years ago, I tried to make a retirement plan,
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.360]   but I never finished it because I cannot come up
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.360]   with a rate of return and inflation rate
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.800]   that I'm comfortable with, specifically the inflation rate,
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.680]   because I agree with a lot of what you say
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.000]   about the federal debt and our economy
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.840]   and no other country is any better.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.040]   So I think it's realistic to expect,
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.880]   and I mean, this is just directionally,
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.080]   it's probably not even close,
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.340]   but if anything, it'd be worse,
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.600]   like 10 to 20% inflation per year,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.080]   if not more going forward.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.720]   We had that somewhere around that this last year,
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.080]   even though people generally don't say we're in recession,
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.960]   we're not doing that bad.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.760]   So just imagine if we actually ever did enter
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.440]   into a recession.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.440]   And so I think it would be irresponsible
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.680]   for me to make a retirement plan
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.920]   that had any assumption of rate of return
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.480]   beyond just breaking even,
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.120]   just keeping the purchasing power you have.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.760]   And in fact, I think that's even too optimistic.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.300]   I think more than likely,
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.480]   like I took a quick look at my balance sheet
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   and I've been getting around eight to 10% returns per year,
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.840]   just in the stock market,
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.400]   but that doesn't account for inflation.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.520]   So I think any returns you could get other than,
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.560]   like you say, being an entrepreneur and having a business,
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.360]   they would be more than eaten up by inflation,
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.920]   even if we don't go into survivalism times.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:48.080]   So just wanted to hear how you can come up
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.920]   with a realistic rate of inflation for a retirement plan.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.680]   - Great question, and an important one.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.080]   First, inflation is, for most retirees,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.840]   the single biggest risk that they face.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.240]   Loss of purchasing power is an enormous
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.920]   and catastrophic risk to the retirement plans
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.400]   of many retirees.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.120]   And it's one of the reasons I work very hard
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.320]   whenever I have the chance
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   to try to get prospective retirees
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.200]   to orient themselves around being concerned
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.960]   more about the loss of purchasing power
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.800]   than about the loss of current value.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.080]   Because some people are so fixated on current value
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.560]   and fluctuations of the current stock price,
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.760]   and so therefore they say,
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.040]   "I've got to go all to fixed income.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.720]   "I've got to go to CDs," things like that.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.440]   But over a long-term retirement, that's not the case.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.360]   Now notice those last three words I said,
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.280]   long-term retirement.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.800]   If I'm counseling an 89-year-old,
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.960]   I'm not spending a lot of time jumping up and down
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.240]   about loss of purchasing power.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.720]   On the contrary, I'm willing to accept loss of principal
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.200]   is a bigger focus because the time is shortened.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.680]   But for a 60-year-old or 65-year-old,
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.080]   I am jumping up and down about loss of purchasing power,
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.600]   and it has to do with long-time perspective.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.000]   Now, in your situation, it's catastrophically worse
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.400]   because you're planning for a very long early retirement.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.080]   So how on earth do we plan for inflation
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.720]   over potentially a 60- or 70-year period?
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.920]   It's just flat-out impossible to predict.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.600]   And I think we need to acknowledge
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.720]   that it's impossible to predict and then build a model
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.520]   that doesn't necessitate us making accurate forecasts
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.640]   or predictions of the future.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.600]   You said, "I think there may be 10% to 20% inflation
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.560]   in the future."
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.840]   I find that to be a reasonable expectation.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.720]   In my own thing, what I've said in past shows
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.640]   is that I think that mass inflation
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.760]   is a reasonable expectation,
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.840]   mass inflation being double-digit
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.880]   but maybe less than 30%.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.920]   So 10% to 20% of inflation rates
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.080]   I think are perfectly reasonable scenarios
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.760]   to be concerned about.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.760]   The reason, the logical argument that makes sense for me
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.360]   is that without inflation,
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.480]   the government is basically stuck with unaffordable,
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.080]   unimpossible finances.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.320]   But hyperinflation doesn't solve the problem,
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.760]   and no inflation doesn't solve the problem.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.240]   So that argument has been that in the fullness of time,
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.640]   mass inflation is probably something
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.080]   that policymakers will look towards.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.520]   Now, does the Federal Reserve Board
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.920]   have the necessary level of independence
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.000]   to keep inflation down when policymakers
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.920]   and monetary fiscal policy deciders
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.720]   are trying to get it up?
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.560]   I don't know.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.800]   I find that whole world so opaque
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.280]   and so impossible to actually know,
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.960]   I just simply don't know.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.800]   But I think that mass inflation
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.560]   is a reasonable thing to be concerned about.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.600]   It's not a reasonable thing
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.880]   to be concerned about for 60 years.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.560]   It's also not a reasonable thing
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   to be concerned about for 30 years.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.600]   It's more of the reasonable thing
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.480]   to be concerned about for some years, five to 10 maybe.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.360]   I don't have any idea.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.400]   I'm just making this up on terms of number.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.400]   Trying to point out though
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.200]   that it's not conceivable for the long-term,
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   for the very long-term.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.400]   Something catastrophic would happen.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.680]   There would be a reset of the financial system,
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.040]   a new system started,
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.440]   and we would move on to whatever that happened to be.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.160]   When it comes to planning though,
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.920]   the problem is if you're forecasting 15% inflation,
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.720]   which is not unreasonable,
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.240]   but you're experiencing 8% asset growth,
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.880]   which is also not unreasonable,
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.440]   there is no possible scenario
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   in which your financial forecasts work.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.720]   The entire premise of financial independence
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.520]   is based upon investments performing
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.320]   and relatively normal financial markets.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.520]   So I don't even try to forecast mass inflation
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.320]   when it comes to a conversation like yours.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.720]   So if we're gonna talk about your personal finances,
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.000]   I'm gonna say, hey, listen,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.120]   why don't you plan on eight to 10% investment returns?
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.000]   That's fine.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.240]   Let's go with 8%, right?
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.440]   'Cause there are good reasons to believe
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.760]   that the future may be a little bit more difficult.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.080]   So let's go with 8% instead of 10%.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.480]   And then with regard to inflation,
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.800]   let's shoot for three or four, right?
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.280]   Let's go for three and then see what happens.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.120]   But then what I want you to do is build a plan
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:28.120]   that allows you to adjust and adapt for a changing
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.680]   market condition.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.360]   And for early retirees, this to me is the core thing
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.220]   is to have multiple plans.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.340]   So if we did get to mass inflation, what would you do?
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.040]   And here we need either significant flexibility
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.680]   in expenses or flexibility in income,
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.400]   the ability to increase your income when you need to.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.960]   And I won't go too deep into it,
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.520]   but when I teach in my retirement course,
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.640]   I go over this in detail and show how
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.360]   the way that you plan for retirement
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.700]   is by building in flexibility and insurance.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.680]   And so let me just use an analogy
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.040]   of going across the country.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.160]   Do you remember MapQuest?
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.400]   You're old enough to remember MapQuest, right?
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.560]   - Yes. - Right.
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.640]   I was thinking about this yesterday.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.320]   I was driving around and I was wondering
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.140]   what happened to them.
[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.080]   I haven't gone and pulled up their website,
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.640]   but MapQuest was revolutionary when I was in high school
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.920]   because for the first time in life,
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.340]   we didn't have to just look at a map
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:22.600]   or get directions from someone.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.560]   We could make our own directions.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.160]   And so I could go to MapQuest.com,
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.640]   I could put in my home address,
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.360]   I could put in the address of my friend's birthday party,
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.680]   and I could get these turn-by-turn directions across town.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.360]   But I had to print them out and carry them with me.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.020]   And if I made a mistake on the way, I had to go back,
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.080]   I had to retrace my steps and find myself
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.560]   until I could follow step-by-step
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.320]   the turn-by-turn directions.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.320]   So imagine that you're trying to go from Miami to Seattle.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.640]   So you have this enormous trip.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.200]   Well, when you're working,
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.520]   basically you know that Seattle is northwest of me.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.720]   And so I need to continually be going a little bit north,
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.560]   a little bit west.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.240]   And so you just start driving and you go north,
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.040]   and then you go west, and you go north and you go west,
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.280]   and you go northwest, and you look at the map.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.200]   The map is your annual financial plan,
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.440]   and you sit down and you know I'm heading for Seattle.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.000]   And that's what it's like when you're working.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.080]   And if you go a few miles outside of your way,
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.420]   meaning overspend a little bit,
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.280]   or projections aren't quite right, no big deal,
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.460]   you're still just going northwest.
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:24.880]   Now, when you get to retirement planning
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.300]   and you start to plan for a life of not working,
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.480]   you're basically doing MapQuest directions.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.240]   And you're sitting down and you're saying,
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.640]   how do I navigate from Miami to Seattle?
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.720]   And you're imagining with early retirement,
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.920]   you've got this huge idea, 60 years to deal with,
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.540]   where I've gotta figure out a 60-year plan,
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:45.640]   and I've gotta print it out today and have it perfect.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.960]   So in the same way that it's, not inconceivable,
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.040]   it's highly unlikely that you could print out
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.560]   the old-fashioned MapQuest turn-by-turn directions
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.000]   in Miami and follow that route perfectly
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.160]   until you wind up in Seattle.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.720]   That's just not really likely.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.000]   There's gonna be all kinds of changes.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.720]   There's gonna be a raccoon in the road.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.480]   Something's gonna happen that's gonna cause you
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.760]   to go off track.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.660]   So your planning needs to be more flexible.
[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:11.500]   So what do you do?
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.960]   Well, you go to MapQuest,
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.480]   or today we would go to, of course, Google Maps,
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.960]   and we would say, all right, here's an estimate
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.160]   of how long it'll go if I drive,
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.520]   and you would maybe plot out some stops,
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.740]   and you would get a good idea of your plan.
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.400]   But then you go with the GPS,
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.560]   and the GPS is that live feedback,
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.500]   that live turn-by-turn feedback.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.880]   So if you make a different turn,
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.340]   or there's an obstacle in the road,
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.920]   you navigate your way around it.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.600]   So a good retirement plan needs to have
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.920]   the MapQuest maps printed out so that you say,
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.480]   this is reasonable, I'm okay with this,
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.240]   but it also needs to have that live, real-time GPS.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.020]   And so you put in place a set of triggers for yourself,
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:55.880]   knowing that if I reach this roadblock of 15% inflation,
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.520]   and stock market has gone down by 30%,
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.720]   then instantly I'm going back to work.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.720]   And by the way, that's why I kept my CPA license current,
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.680]   and that's why I kept some industry connections.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.300]   So instantly I'm going back to work,
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.120]   and I'm going back to work for five years,
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.100]   and then after five years, I'll reassess,
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.480]   and we'll get back on track.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.720]   So you can't do planning for a mass inflation scenario
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.720]   that's predictable, it's inconceivable that it's possible.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.780]   But what you can do is you can imagine
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.920]   how you would respond to different market conditions,
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.080]   and then put that in place.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.620]   And then finally, insurance.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.840]   Then you look at your overall situation,
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.080]   and you say, do I have some assets
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.200]   that would be protected from inflation?
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.280]   So this is where the value of owning a home,
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.300]   and having a little cabin that you live in
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.160]   that has solar panels on the roof,
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.920]   and is own debt free, and has very low property taxes,
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.200]   and having a garden in the back,
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.880]   well, this makes you largely less subject
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.240]   to the vagaries of inflation.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.680]   And then looking at your assets and making sure,
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.080]   okay, I've got some assets
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.440]   that I can adjust with inflation, things like that.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.600]   So that's my metaphor, and that's how I approach it.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.900]   - Thanks so much.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.640]   I guess my main struggle with that is,
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:09.280]   I was describing 10 to 20% more as not something
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.640]   that might happen five to 10 years in a 60-year period,
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.740]   but that maybe it'll get better, it'll get worse,
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.080]   but on average, it would be at least that bad.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.760]   So even to make it easier for the example,
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.160]   can you see a scenario where,
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.220]   on average, over the next 60 years,
[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:27.680]   you would have inflation that's better than,
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.160]   or even significantly better than 8%?
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.080]   Like, I know we've had that historically,
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.280]   but just seeing all the trends you're pointing out,
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.440]   I don't see any reasonable way to think
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.640]   that in the future that's gonna be the case.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.360]   - I can't myself see that, but I can't argue against it.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:50.480]   Meaning, can I see that happening?
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:55.480]   No, I think that the impact of experiencing mass inflation
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:02.040]   for a very long period of time would be so significant
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.360]   that we would basically have to reinvent
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.800]   our entire financial system,
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.960]   and I don't have any idea what that would look like.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.560]   But I also can't argue against it and tell you,
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.720]   here's how I think we get out of this thing.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.880]   So I'm not an economist, that's a good question
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.640]   to go and ask some brilliant economist,
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.680]   but I don't know how we get out of this thing.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.280]   Now, I don't know how we get out of the current thing.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.720]   We're just along for the ride,
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.540]   kind of waiting to see what happens.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.400]   So I try to see what are those principles
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.040]   that will work out in most scenarios,
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.160]   but the answer is no, I can't see how we could have
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.560]   those high levels of inflation for that long period of time.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.720]   Now, a couple of quick things to point out.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.960]   Our modern economic system has been reset
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.120]   three or four times in the last century.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.440]   Most of our data from something resembling
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.460]   our current economic system really only goes back
[01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:53.960]   a little more than a hundred years,
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.280]   a little over a century now.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.560]   And even that, the economy back then
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.320]   is so wildly different than it is today,
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.060]   it's hard to even know.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.000]   The latest big reset was, of course,
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.340]   the going off the gold standard under Nixon.
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:10.200]   That was an enormous reset of monetary policy.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.160]   So we're very new into this current scenario.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:17.720]   And the U.S. dollar has experienced huge hyperinflation,
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.120]   but the U.S. dollar has been reset, revalued,
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.560]   is it three times or four times,
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.600]   going back all the way to right after the Revolutionary War.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.600]   So it's perfectly reasonable to say,
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.220]   hey, this can't continue and there's gonna be
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.640]   some kind of enormous reset.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.120]   That's perfectly reasonable to me.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.440]   I just don't know what that would be
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.760]   or what it would look like.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:40.020]   So we're just along for the ride.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.680]   And so I try to focus on those things
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:44.140]   that would have to not, that can't change.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.680]   So assets that are good assets
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.360]   are always gonna have some kind of value.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.960]   Could their value be destroyed and diminished?
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.920]   Yes, but if you've got a house
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.280]   and you can live in that house
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.440]   and someone else can live in the house,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.880]   the house has some value in any economy,
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.240]   whether you're paid in U.S. dollars
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.080]   or whether you're paid in green bucks or whatever,
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.940]   Bitcoin or whatever it happens to be,
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.600]   that house has a basic utility.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.840]   It's an encapsulation of labor and material
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.840]   and it provides a utility.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.200]   A business, if you own a business
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.300]   and the business is making money,
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.320]   that's gonna have value.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.660]   So regardless of the currency it's set in,
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:18.040]   regardless of that stuff, it's gonna have value.
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.160]   So all that say is that no, I can't predict,
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:25.480]   I don't see how we could have 60 years of 15% inflation
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.680]   in any of our current paradigms,
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.180]   but I can't argue against it.
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.880]   So I wanna focus on those principles
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.600]   that probably are gonna work no matter what it looks like
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.600]   and then just wait and see what happens.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:39.720]   - Thanks, I'll merge it on to related topics
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.560]   in future weeks.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.380]   Thanks for your help.
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.220]   - Thank you, Samuel.
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.440]   I'm enjoying our serial conversation.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.200]   Nathan in Texas, welcome to the show.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.500]   How can I serve you today?
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.880]   - Hey, thanks Joshua.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.640]   Calling today, one of my summer goals
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:58.140]   has been to help my elementary age kids
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.260]   just kind of progress on their financial literacy,
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:06.280]   just general level.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.840]   And I have a very kind of like some loose ideas,
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.360]   but just calling to compare notes
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.360]   and be kind of refined by your thoughts
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.120]   and then also use it as a good jumpstart
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.360]   to get me going on that goal
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.720]   'cause the summer is ticking away.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.640]   So yeah, I'd just love to hear my oldest is 12,
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.720]   my youngest is five, I've got four.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.680]   So yeah, I can tell you more
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.600]   or you can take it from there.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.720]   - Yeah, so you said 12 to five, right?
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.640]   So those are gonna be wildly different experiences
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.080]   for all of them.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.560]   Do you, what are some of the influences
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.360]   other than my podcast or whatever,
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.840]   like what are some of the influences
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.820]   that have been the most formative for you yourself
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:49.880]   with regard to how you think about money?
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.320]   - I would say probably first and foremost,
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.920]   my family of origin, what I observed there
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.760]   and probably just worldview
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.920]   and kind of the Christian teaching on stewardship
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.240]   and things like that.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.720]   Yeah, I would say probably it's like,
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.840]   you double clicked on my family of origin.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.840]   Certainly, if I look at my maternal grandfather,
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.520]   he lived through the depression.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.520]   So my folks always really appreciated frugality.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.440]   So going back to somebody that was talking about scarcity,
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.440]   I think that frugality can lean towards scarcity sometimes.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:41.080]   But definitely kind of like the Dave Ramsey principles
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.080]   of earning more than you spend
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:50.220]   and being prepared for emergencies, those sorts of things.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:54.440]   Yeah, but then definitely I'm animated personally
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.560]   by the idea of stewardship
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.560]   and that we really need to give a good account
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.520]   for how we use our time, talent and treasure.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.700]   So I wanna get the kids used to,
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.040]   I think you've talked about this,
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.000]   money flowing through their hands.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.360]   And so while I never grew up with an allowance,
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.200]   that's one thing that I have considered
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.160]   just to kind of get them used to more coming in
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.360]   and going out and then build on that.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.640]   - Right, I've given some thought to this
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.880]   and probably many of my thoughts are encapsulated
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.400]   in the series that I'm currently doing
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.320]   on financial goals everyone should set.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:36.280]   I've wanted to build a high school finance curriculum
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.080]   and I may do it in the fullness of time, we'll see.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.560]   But that would ultimately be the answer
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.480]   because there are some really foundational lessons
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.500]   that all teenagers should be taught.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.080]   Those lessons are usually things that are mentioned
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.800]   and then skipped past in most books
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.080]   because most books are written for adults.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.560]   So for example, cornerstone foundational lesson
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.360]   is understanding the time value of money.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.240]   And so students should be made to memorize charts
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.320]   showing if I earn money and invest it at a young age,
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.840]   what the difference is if I do that at a young age
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.440]   versus in the long run.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.820]   That's something that you'll see
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:17.380]   in a lot of introductory finance discussions,
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:18.760]   but it's just kind of skipped past.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.200]   But really them getting their heads around that
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.960]   is something that is, I think, really important.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.880]   I think what's even more motivational than that
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.440]   would be the charts related to the math of early retirement,
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.560]   understanding how savings rates
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.760]   compared to spending rates.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.600]   For me, that was enormously transformative
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.600]   and I wish I'd understood that when I was 14
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.800]   or 12 or whatever.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.960]   Beyond that, a lot of the knowledge has to do more
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.240]   with things that are best learned in doing
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.100]   rather than in learning about.
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.400]   So there are some books that I would recommend.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.040]   My favorite book on the subject is "Richest Man in Babylon."
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.680]   That, I think, is the core fundamental text
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.840]   that needs to be done.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.280]   "Richest Man in Babylon" is one of the very few
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.160]   living books on money that I know of.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:08.140]   And I've recorded the entire thing,
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.280]   so you can just have them listen to the audio recordings
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.240]   that I've released here in the podcast feed
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.980]   or have them read it and talk about it.
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:18.600]   But "Richest Man in Babylon" is, I think, the starting point.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.320]   A lot of the other books that I recommend to adults
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.480]   aren't necessarily applicable to children.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.660]   So I have, of course, Radical Booklist.
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.280]   Radicalbooklist.com if you wanna get
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.520]   Joshua's "Financial Freedom" book list,
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.320]   and I send you the list of recommended books to work on.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.920]   But I would say probably two or three of those
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.240]   are appropriate for children
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.440]   and the others are not so appropriate.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.560]   So I don't know of a lot of books.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.200]   I think there are many books that could be offered,
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.920]   and I would see it as, with many things,
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.240]   more important to focus on making a habit
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.640]   of choosing books and reading books
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.080]   rather than any one particular text.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.600]   After "Richest Man in Babylon,"
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.620]   because the ideas are so sticky
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:03.000]   based upon the way that it's presented,
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.980]   then I would say basically choosing books
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:07.800]   that stimulate the thinker.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.480]   So if you're gonna focus on this from a book perspective,
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.120]   I would be more inclined to say,
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.520]   I would assign "The Richest Man in Babylon,"
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.640]   and then I would say, when we go to the library,
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:23.000]   I want you to pick out at least two or three books on money
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.680]   and look through them or read them
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:26.820]   and make that the ongoing practice.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:30.040]   Because a book on money can be adapted enormously,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.520]   and you suggest titles that you have found useful
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.780]   or that you think would be useful to a particular child,
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:41.080]   but they're often pretty customized.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.880]   So I don't have this list right off the bat,
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:46.880]   but anything that is story-based and principle-based
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.320]   rather than technical-based,
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.400]   I think is what you're looking for.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.260]   So "Richest Man in Babylon," "Wealthy Barber."
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:55.920]   Is there a Morgan House book, I think,
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.920]   that was like a narrative-based?
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.860]   I don't have a list of titles current,
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:01.360]   but anything that's narrative-based
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.280]   and that's story-based would be good.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.540]   Anything that provides discussion of goals
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:07.240]   that is appropriate.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.160]   So Steve Maxwell's book
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.560]   "On Teaching Your Sons to Buy Debt-Free Houses,"
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.080]   I think is such a powerful book
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.720]   because it relates and he shares and shows,
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.120]   look, here's how all of my sons
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.120]   bought houses debt-free before they were married
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.680]   in their earlier mid-20s,
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.640]   which is just powerful to give children a goal.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.560]   So that's kind of the book discussion.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.920]   More than the book discussion,
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.640]   I think what you're looking for
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.720]   is to focus on the principles
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.320]   that will get money passing through their hands.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.000]   So what I would love for you to,
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.480]   what I would say is take the series
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:40.880]   that I'm doing right now,
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.440]   listen to it with your children,
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.880]   or just listen to it yourself
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.400]   and then talk about the concepts with children.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.920]   And I'm trying to break that series
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:53.920]   into discrete concepts
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.680]   that are just enough to say,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.320]   here's what it is and then here's why it's important.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.760]   And then just start walking your children down that list.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760]   So you're a 12-year-old,
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.360]   you can start the task of getting a job,
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.480]   getting a summer job or getting a Christmas break job.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.680]   Doesn't need to be a lot,
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:12.320]   but a couple of weeks of him working with something,
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.480]   that puts a little money in his pocket
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.280]   will dramatically transform his questions.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.600]   And then when he gets the job,
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.880]   then the first thing you're gonna talk about
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.960]   is how much does he save?
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.880]   How much does he spend?
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.080]   How much does he give?
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:26.280]   That's a good platform for your stewardship discussion.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.960]   Once that happens, you can talk about what to invest in.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.400]   And we'll talk about that or talk about who to give it to.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.280]   So I think it's more important that these ages,
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.040]   that there's just money flowing through their hands,
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.120]   either in the form of an allowance or in terms of a job,
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.840]   and then that you're giving the instruction.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.240]   As they go into teenage years,
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.240]   then to go through the Crown course.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.960]   If stewardship is a big thing,
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.760]   the Crown financial course is fantastic.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.280]   So go ahead and take your children through it
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:49.960]   as a family exercise
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.040]   and use some of those structured courses.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.560]   But there's not just any one thing.
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.960]   It's more a matter of cultivating the belief
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.220]   that it's possible, it's doable, it's expected,
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.920]   and then cultivating the specific habit of,
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.840]   if I say that I care about money
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.300]   and I actually care about money,
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.520]   then I ought to be reading at least two or three books
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:11.160]   a year on money and processing the ideas.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.560]   So that I'm continually being taught and educated
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.960]   and getting better and better at managing my money.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.560]   - Okay, yeah, I think all that makes sense.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.480]   Certainly some of those ideas,
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:24.160]   like I don't know if it's just thinking too low
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:30.760]   of like what my kids are ready to work on.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.600]   Certainly I can see all of that with my oldest,
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.480]   the 12-year-old.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.440]   The others that are like nine, six, and five,
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:42.200]   I'm trying to like imagine these conversations
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.040]   in a good way.
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.200]   Like I can kind of tell from the way you're sharing about it
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.680]   you guys just have regular family conversation
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.440]   or conversation with your kids
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.120]   about all of these ideas and principles.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.800]   So I certainly try to share as much openly
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.800]   as I can with my kids.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.520]   But it's also like if I pull up the spreadsheet
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.800]   with the budget or show them a time value
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.040]   of money investment chart,
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.480]   like my six-year-old's gonna wanna play soccer,
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.320]   which is great.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.160]   So yeah, go ahead.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.640]   - Let me interrupt you to disagree with you,
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.120]   is that no, I don't have constant conversations
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.720]   about this with my children.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.160]   I don't see how this is developmentally appropriate
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.920]   for an eight-year-old to talk about.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:27.640]   I answer the questions, like it's not a secret,
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.000]   but I don't think that this is a core component
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.840]   of what eight-year-olds should be focused on.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.760]   I think eight-year-olds should be focused on stories
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.560]   and they should be slaying dragons
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.120]   and they should be building tree forts
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.360]   and they should be winning princesses' hearts
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.200]   and thinking about,
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.200]   and there's no, I reject the hustle culture idea
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:48.000]   that our eight-year-old should have a cell phone
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.200]   to their ears, focusing on doing the next deal
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.360]   so that they can make more money
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.440]   and yelling at all their friends
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.560]   about why are you guys wasting time?
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.440]   We do want to instill character,
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.080]   but I don't think that this is appropriate
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:34:59.920]   for younger people.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.360]   And I was answering basically with your 12-year-old.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.640]   So with the 12-year-old,
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.080]   that's where most of this comes in.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.440]   With the other ones,
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.240]   I think it's more important things that are caught
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:12.480]   and just discussed in the natural context of your life.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.640]   So with regard to stewardship,
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.120]   if you're gonna put money in the box at church,
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.200]   let's say that you have an option,
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.920]   okay, I could give online
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.380]   or I could put money in the box at church,
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.040]   then put money in the box at church
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.480]   and have one of your children take it
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.280]   and put the money in every week,
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.600]   put in, drop the envelope in the box every week
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.080]   so that they know that this is something
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.360]   that we do every week.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.680]   If you're gonna go out to eat,
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.720]   hand whatever it is,
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.280]   put money in your children's hands
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.000]   and let them make the decisions.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.440]   That's where, as you've heard me talk about previously,
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.160]   the concept of an allowance, I think it's important
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.800]   'cause it allows them to spend things,
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.840]   save for things, look for jobs, look for all that stuff.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.480]   But in terms of technical education,
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.600]   I don't think that any of this
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.840]   is particularly relevant at a young age.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.480]   I think that it's most important to cultivate imagination
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.760]   and ideas and academic ability
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.720]   and unique skills and strong things at that basis.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.040]   'Cause money is not that hard to master.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.480]   Like, it's really not.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.360]   It's a basic set of steps
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.240]   and it can be learned perfectly well in the teenage years.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.840]   Now, I do have more to say on it,
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.160]   which I'm not gonna do in this context,
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.080]   but I think your goal is, hey, by 15, 16,
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.820]   you're bringing your child into the family finances,
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:24.840]   discussing things.
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.560]   I think your ambition should be that your children,
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.560]   basically, by the time they're, I don't know, 14, 15, 16,
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:31.640]   something like that,
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:33.040]   is that you're treating them as adults.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.240]   And one of the things of treating them as adults
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.320]   will just be just bringing them
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320]   into the family finances in some way.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.640]   So I don't think having opacity
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.820]   with regard to finances is appropriate.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.240]   Sharing is important,
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.200]   and especially as they start to head towards college,
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.680]   opening up about here's what we have, here's what I earn,
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.280]   here's what our budget looks like.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.600]   Having them take responsibility for things.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.360]   So putting and saying,
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.080]   okay, I want you to do the grocery shopping,
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.600]   and I'm gonna take you three times
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.280]   to do the grocery shopping and show you,
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.160]   but now, this summer, your responsibility
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:02.040]   is to buy the groceries.
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.800]   Here's the list, here's the money.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.920]   Anything you can do that's doing
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.200]   and related to money is really valuable.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.200]   But in terms of education or reading,
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.960]   it's not that relevant
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.680]   until there's significant money flowing through.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.960]   So it's gonna be much more impactful
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:20.800]   if you read "Richest Man in Babylon"
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.360]   and then focus on getting a job, doing well in school,
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.680]   getting scholarships, getting to college,
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.520]   and then providing appropriate training with summer jobs
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.320]   and then, and here's how you handle it
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.920]   versus giving a student a giant stack of books.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.960]   - Yeah, okay, that's perfect.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.840]   And I think that aligns with my expectations.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.320]   Give me a brief thought on what you would think
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.880]   some good allowance uses.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:47.000]   I'm looking to spark a little creativity
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.240]   in my own mind here.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.600]   Beyond just like, you know, the younger elementary kids,
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.320]   like, of course, you're like,
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.040]   maybe you just do the simple, like, give, save, spend,
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.120]   you know, like, just three.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.360]   And so, of course, you're like, you know,
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.800]   you're saving for the Lego set or whatever, you know,
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.120]   whatever they come up with.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.560]   I had not thought of the idea of like,
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.840]   okay, like, when they got to eat as a family,
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.760]   you know, like, your kid's meal is gonna be nine bucks.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.600]   Here you go, here's nine bucks for everybody.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.160]   Pick what you want.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.640]   What are some other ways that you have thought
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.440]   about encouraging kids to use allowance
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.000]   and then kind of deciding how much money
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]   to funnel through there?
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000]   - Sure, the key, I think, is just to be verbal with children
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.320]   and train every time you can.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.560]   So, when you go out to eat, talk about the cost
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:39.560]   and explain how it works, that here's what you see,
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.680]   then it's gonna be increased by taxes,
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.360]   then we have to leave a tip, here's what the cost is,
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.400]   here's what the budget is, just discussing things.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:48.360]   When you go to the grocery store with your children,
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.640]   talk about unit pricing, here's what we need to buy,
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.520]   value per calorie, dollar per calorie,
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.040]   whatever it is that you are focused on,
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.760]   just talking about those things and recognizing
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.240]   that every time I make a decision,
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.880]   it's my job to instruct my children in what I'm thinking
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.160]   so that they will reflect my values and attitudes
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.560]   and that my instruction will form a background,
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.240]   knowledge base for them in the fullness of time.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.240]   To your question, as far as allowances, I have a system.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.180]   I have implemented it imperfectly.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.800]   I'm not satisfied with how I'm actually implementing it,
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.840]   but I still think it makes a lot of sense
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.440]   and it's what I'm seeking to implement.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.920]   The lack of implementation is primarily due to,
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.060]   I don't even know what currency
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.400]   to give my children an allowance in
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.560]   because we travel so much.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.520]   So that's been, I don't expect most people
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:38.720]   to share that frustration, but it is a real frustration.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.640]   So put simply, I don't call it good,
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.800]   so here's my names for it,
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:47.560]   is I teach my children to have three bags.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.360]   I give them literally bags of money
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.480]   and bag number one is a giving bag,
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.240]   bag number two is an investing bag
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.600]   and bag number three is a spending bag.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.320]   I give them a certain amount of money
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.240]   and then I encourage, I tell them to divide it into three.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.280]   And so you should choose an amount of money
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.520]   that will make a lot of sense to divide it into three.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.520]   So it might be $6 a week so that it can be two in each bag
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:13.040]   or it may be $60, whatever it is.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:13.960]   But what you're looking for
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:16.180]   is to have a relevant amount of money
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:19.280]   that they can accumulate enough to buy the kinds of things
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.040]   that you think they should be doing.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.120]   So I just split it into thirds
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:26.000]   because I think it makes for simpler math
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.640]   versus some other random percentage.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.320]   So the giving bag is money to give away to other people.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.580]   So if I'm gonna give you $12 a week,
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.700]   then we're gonna put $4 in the giving bag
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.280]   and then the giving bag is going to accumulate.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:41.640]   So who and what do you want to give it to?
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.200]   And so you have a family conversation.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.440]   Are you gonna give it to the plate at church?
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.840]   Are you gonna give it to the missionary offering?
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.400]   Are you gonna give it to your friend's birthday present?
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.240]   Are you gonna give it
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.160]   to your brother's birthday party outing?
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.880]   Are you gonna give it to the person in need
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:56.800]   on the side of the street?
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.240]   Doesn't matter, just encourage them
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.360]   to be looking for opportunities to give it.
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.840]   The investing bag, I don't call it saving
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.440]   'cause this is not a savings bag.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.520]   The investing bag is the wealth fund.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.560]   So money only goes into the investing bag
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.500]   and it only comes out to invest and then it goes back in.
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:16.440]   The idea is I think that children especially
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.320]   should be taught that we only get richer.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.240]   So the way you do that is by making sure
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.920]   you don't ever consume all your money.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.720]   And so you always have a financial freedom fund.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.880]   You always have an amount that goes in
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.360]   and this is what it's gonna be used for.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.400]   So you put $4 into the investing bag
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:32.800]   and then it accumulates and then you say,
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.880]   okay, well, dad, what can I invest in?
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.840]   And you look around and say,
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.160]   well, maybe you can sell candy at school.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.600]   If we go to Costco and you buy a bunch of bags of M&Ms,
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.600]   you can take those to school and you can sell them at school
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.040]   or any other version of kind of buying and selling.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.860]   In general, buying and selling is gonna be the key thing.
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:51.240]   You may modernize that, right?
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:54.360]   You really love to go on eBay and look for Legos.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.520]   So go and buy the Legos and then flip them
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.640]   or let's go to Walmart.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.640]   Let's see what we can buy there
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.460]   and what we can flip to eBay.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:03.200]   Let's go and see if you can buy a bicycle
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.400]   and fix it up and sell it.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.920]   Can you go and buy, maybe with a 14 year old,
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.000]   can we go and buy broken washing machines
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.380]   and flip them and fix them and sell them on Craigslist?
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.800]   Always looking for things that you can buy or sell
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.380]   as a way of investing.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:21.120]   And then as you grow there, then building little businesses.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.280]   So let's get bread materials
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.760]   and let's bake bread and sell it.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.240]   Let's go and buy something wholesale and sell it for retail.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.560]   There's so many things that can be done
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.240]   and all of those kinds of things
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.000]   need to be done from the investing bag.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.560]   And then the third one is spending.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.880]   And so spending just means you're gonna spend it
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.040]   on whatever you want.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.680]   Now, here is where saving comes in.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.760]   So here's where I'm happy to say,
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.440]   yeah, just accumulate money in your spending bag
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.640]   until you have a lot of money.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:45.960]   And then when you have a lot of money,
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.280]   you can buy something bigger.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.720]   But if you wanna go out and buy something
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.240]   for $2 every time, then of course that's your prerogative.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.640]   So that's what I'm doing.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.520]   And I think it's the right thing to do
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.960]   because it covers all of the important components of it
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.720]   and yet does it in a good and straightforward way
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.060]   that needs to be continued.
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:07.240]   So start there and then go continue on.

[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.400]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.800]   - Yes, Josh, thanks.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.780]   I've enjoyed your recent series on financial goals.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.800]   My kids are a little bit older than yours
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.360]   and every summer I require them to do a report
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:52.840]   on work or a job field
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:55.360]   that they could possibly go into after school
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.680]   with the potential for them to convince our family
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.700]   that we're gonna fund that education.
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:03.880]   I want them to live a rich life.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:05.960]   Of course, that doesn't require a huge income
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:09.800]   but it's easy to be restrained at the medium income
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:11.040]   and things you'd like to do
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.320]   and ways you'd like to invest in your children
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.720]   or your family.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.520]   I see being an entrepreneur is very fashionable.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.040]   It's very fashionable to advise young people to do that
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.800]   but I read a lot and personally see a lot of people
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.040]   who have their own paycheck
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.760]   and they invest enormous blood, sweat and tears into it
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.480]   and then they have maybe just a paycheck
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.280]   but not anything really substantial
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:37.160]   with regards to income.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.640]   So my question to you is,
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.400]   with your experience working maybe
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.200]   with lower net worth individuals
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.680]   at the beginning of your career
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:45.160]   and then moving on to,
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.400]   I know you've said many times,
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.200]   you've learned that your job is to help people with money,
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.240]   that's what gets a lot of income coming in.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:58.700]   If you were to advise a young person on broad paths to take
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.480]   going into the future,
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.240]   looking at trying to earn in the 80 to 90th percentile,
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:07.560]   could you categorize into somewhere between,
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.720]   let's say two and seven buckets,
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:15.000]   people who are making more than $150,000 a year?
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.520]   I think there's obviously a large number of people
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:18.640]   who are doing that
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:20.600]   but if you were to go look online,
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.320]   it'd be difficult to find jobs
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:27.540]   that are listed at $150,000 a year or more.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.160]   Are all these people doctors and lawyers
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:32.960]   or what are some broad categories
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.640]   that these people tend to be in?
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.380]   - Good question, interesting.
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:42.320]   We could answer that by just pulling up the BLS,
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.240]   the Bureau of Labor Statistics data
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:48.060]   and look at what they have to do
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:51.340]   or you could answer it by going and finding your Asian
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:52.600]   or your Asian friends
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.200]   and seeing what they encourage their children to do.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.160]   There's a joke that if your parents are Indian,
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.440]   you've got a lawyer in the house,
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:59.400]   you've got a doctor in the house
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:02.240]   and if you've got a third child, you've got an engineer.
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.820]   It's not too far wrong in terms of that approach.
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:08.860]   First, I think the way to do that
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:12.940]   is really to hammer, hammer, hammer on education.
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:15.080]   So the next series in,
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.520]   the next podcast in the series that I'm gonna talk about
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.640]   is going to be getting all of the education
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.780]   that you can get.
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:24.840]   And if you look at the kinds of people
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:28.880]   who have high needs for education,
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:33.880]   that's your most correlated feature
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.440]   to what you're saying,
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.560]   to a top 20% income
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.960]   is gonna be significant amounts of education.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.120]   Any kind of advanced degree or qualification
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.440]   is going to be the pathway to that.
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:51.360]   And the big ones that you mentioned are,
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.520]   number one, medicine.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.780]   Medicine pays very well in the United States.
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.920]   Medicine pays well for doctors,
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.120]   but it also pays well for nurses.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.860]   It pays well for all of the specializations
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:05.280]   within nursing or within medicine.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.200]   And that's a very reliable way working in healthcare
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:11.960]   for high levels of income.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.240]   The second one relates to law.
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:17.780]   Law is a relatively high paying career
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:21.060]   and it's reliably associated with good incomes
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:24.760]   and a lot of work and advanced education.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:29.760]   Engineering is also consistent, is a consistent category.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:34.280]   Engineering has the problem of being more limited
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.640]   than the other ones.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:36.800]   One of the frustrations,
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.340]   I've consulted with a number of engineers
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:40.120]   who are kind of at the top of their field,
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.800]   and one of the consistent frustrations for engineers
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.040]   is they kind of max out much sooner
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.440]   than some other careers do.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.360]   So a lawyer can become more specialized
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.520]   or go into a certain area
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:55.360]   and have a much higher ceiling than an engineer can.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.440]   And so an engineer who's working for other people,
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.720]   for whatever reason,
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:01.080]   they just often aren't paid huge amounts of money,
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.720]   but they are certainly paid top 20% income
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.240]   when they're at the top of their career.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.160]   The biggest category that doesn't fit necessarily
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:13.880]   that pathway of formalized schooling
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:16.240]   is information technology.
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:19.280]   So anyone related to information technology
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.600]   because of the newness of that industry,
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.760]   while certainly getting a degree in computer science
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.300]   can be an important asset,
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:27.400]   it's not the automatic pathway.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.520]   And so there's a lot more people
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.520]   who are making quite a lot of money in the tech industry
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:36.080]   who didn't get there with the formalized schooling process.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.240]   I wonder if that will change in the future,
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.040]   but so far, since that industry is still so relatively new,
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.720]   it hasn't happened.
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.520]   Finance is a huge category
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.440]   that would have to be represented in what you're saying.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.000]   Finance is kind of a hodgepodge of different things.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.400]   There's some aspects of corporate finance
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.360]   that certainly will pay well.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:02.520]   Then there's banking and Wall Street stuff,
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:06.020]   but if you're in your local town,
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.440]   financial jobs of a guy who sells insurance,
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.220]   the guy, property and casualty or life insurance,
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:14.040]   local financial advisors,
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.080]   generally speaking,
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.320]   if somebody has been in that business
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.480]   for at least five years,
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.320]   it's hard to believe that they're not in the top 20%.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:24.080]   So that's certainly gonna be a component of it.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.400]   We talked about,
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.000]   I guess I didn't mention pharmacy
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.020]   when I was talking to healthcare.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.200]   Pharmacy would be another category.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:35.200]   High-skilled technical jobs like aviation could certainly fit.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:38.080]   Aviation definitely can pay top 20%.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.080]   And by the way, there's a huge shortage of pilots right now.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:43.480]   So that's a very promising one.
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.640]   Then you get to the less predictable,
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.320]   but certainly impactful one.
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:48.960]   You get the whole world of business
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.720]   or just corporate work.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.080]   So corporate executives
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.080]   and middle and upper-level managers
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.080]   certainly generally all fall into that category.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:59.720]   And so there's a huge number of those
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.120]   and there are always education requirements,
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:05.280]   but it's not as specialized with regard to education
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:08.160]   as other things.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.920]   And then certainly we would have a category on there
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.320]   for structured entrepreneurship.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:14.920]   Here I think of real estate brokers
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.000]   or mortgage offices,
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.800]   things like that where it's entrepreneurship,
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:20.720]   but it's entrepreneurship
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:23.760]   within a kind of a structured industry,
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.960]   not just from the skies.
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.680]   So it is entrepreneurship,
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:31.360]   but it's a different style.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.540]   You don't have to come up with a unique business.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.820]   Those would be some that occur to me
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:38.300]   and all of them are fruitful in high-income wages.
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:42.240]   - All right, thank you very much.
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.360]   - My pleasure.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.000]   We go on to Lucas in New Jersey.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:46.840]   Welcome to the show.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.840]   How are you doing today, Lucas?
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.240]   - Hey, Joshua.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:51.600]   One comment to your last caller.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:55.200]   As an engineer who is making his way up the career ladder,
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.360]   if you wanna be technical and make money in engineering,
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.800]   you gotta go the management track.
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:01.480]   That's been my observation.
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.480]   And to this scarcity mindset
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.120]   that seems to be the focal point of today's show,
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.280]   I would highly recommend,
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.800]   I know it's hard for men, it was hard for me,
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.120]   find a good therapist.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:14.800]   It's the best way to address some of these things
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.080]   and you just can't quite get past.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.960]   - Here's where I would put in, what is it?
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.120]   Better health is advertising everywhere these days.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:24.920]   So find your podcaster that has a better health referral link
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.440]   and try with something like that.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.720]   - Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:29.800]   Well, onto my question.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:32.640]   So my wife and I are operating a small business
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.920]   and we're getting ready to hire an accountant
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.280]   for our business.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.400]   We use QuickBooks and we wanna create an accountant profile,
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:42.160]   but we haven't signed anything with this accountant
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.360]   and wanna make sure that we're not putting ourselves
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.200]   at any risk.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.280]   Now, I've vetted them, I've spoken to them,
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.520]   they have great reviews.
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:51.560]   I've done that, but I wanna get your input
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:54.000]   on what we should look for as we hire this person
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.240]   to make sure that we're getting the real deal,
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.480]   we're protecting ourselves,
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.440]   and just kind of what is standard
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.520]   when you're hiring an accountant?
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.400]   What should we be looking for?
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:02.640]   What should we be signing?
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:05.000]   - By any risk, are you mainly thinking about data
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.760]   or just the whole thing in general?
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:09.600]   - Mostly data.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:13.400]   Anytime we're letting someone open their eyes to our books,
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:15.840]   I think this'll probably come up
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:18.000]   and this is just the first time that it's happened.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.640]   And my wife and I are both sitting here like,
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:22.520]   oh, we haven't officially hired them,
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:26.640]   but we want to know that they are competent,
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.920]   so we want them to kind of see what we're doing.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.000]   And I wanna make sure I'm thinking about this right
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.800]   and what should we be putting in place
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.800]   so that we can hire them and feel good about that process?
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.880]   - Yeah, there's a technical answer
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.840]   and then there's a realistic answer
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:48.360]   and they're pretty much opposite one another.
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.800]   So let me give both of them.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:54.080]   So the technical answer that I have warned in the past
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.760]   is basically something akin to,
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.200]   you should really never give anyone access
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:01.920]   to your private financial information.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.560]   Anytime you give someone access
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.520]   to your private financial information,
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:09.040]   you're creating risk for yourself.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.080]   And so if you go to your accountant
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:12.880]   and you take your accountant to your books,
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.320]   you're creating risk.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.160]   An element of that risk is always going to be data leakage
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.520]   from just simply a cybersecurity component,
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.440]   but you have that now, right?
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:24.840]   If you're using QuickBooks Online
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.400]   and your data is being stored in the cloud,
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:30.960]   you have a risk that your personal data can be targeted,
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.080]   you can be hacked and it can be stolen,
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:34.160]   even though it is encrypted,
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:35.760]   even though QuickBooks is a big company,
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.240]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:41.200]   Any data that's stored in the cloud is always prone to attack.
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.200]   You should assume at all times
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.080]   that all data that you store in the cloud,
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:46.800]   including your most important financial data,
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:47.720]   is going to be hacked
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.120]   and is going to be sold on the internet.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.640]   That's a standard assumption
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.680]   with anything related to the internet.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:54.040]   When you're talking about interacting
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.240]   with another individual, you have more risks.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:00.920]   So you have risks of people in that individual's office
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.600]   being able to see the data.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:05.080]   So when I was a financial advisor, I had data,
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.680]   all kinds of financial data of all of my clients.
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:12.040]   I had an assistant who had access to my files.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.920]   And if my assistant had wanted to review client data,
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.160]   the assistant could.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:18.680]   And then there's a whole management structure
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:20.480]   in the financial industry of all kinds of people
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480]   who have access to the files.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.960]   My managing director, of course, had access to all my files.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.840]   My compliance officer obviously did.
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:27.560]   Managing partners, all up and down.
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.520]   And the accountant is the same basic way.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.840]   You usually have a smaller office
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.480]   if you have an independent accountant,
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:34.560]   but the accountant has access to your files.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:35.880]   Anybody working for the accountant
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:37.640]   is probably gonna have access to the files.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.040]   If you're in a small office
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.760]   that isn't gonna have multiple layers of management,
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.200]   then usually there's gonna be
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:46.920]   less sophisticated data management systems.
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.720]   So probably everyone in the office
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.360]   has access to all the client files,
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:53.320]   unless they're a more sophisticated, larger firm
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:56.160]   with better security protocols.
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:58.280]   So what that means is that anybody in the office
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.760]   can see your accounts because that's what happens.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:04.080]   That's just how it works.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.440]   In addition to that, you create legal risk for yourself.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.760]   So let's say that you and your wife are in business today,
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:13.760]   but then, you know, three months from now
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.520]   or six months from now, you hire this accountant.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.440]   Six months from now, you turn over your records.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:20.000]   Six months from now, she divorces you,
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.600]   and you're trying to defend yourself against her.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:25.200]   And so you try to delete all your data for your business,
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:27.080]   and you're trying to get rid of all those records.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:32.080]   Well, now, because you've given that data to someone else,
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:35.360]   then that someone else can be subpoenaed,
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.160]   and the data can be gotten from that someone else.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.800]   And so if you were working with me as a financial advisor,
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.040]   and if I had client files on you,
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.280]   and you went and were declaring bankruptcy,
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.120]   and you told me about the million dollars
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:51.960]   of gold in your backyard, and I had that written down,
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.480]   million dollars of gold in the backyard
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.760]   underneath the oak tree,
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.200]   then all my client notes can be subpoenaed
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.640]   by the judge, by the lawyer,
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:01.720]   and all of that is public record to the court.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:05.080]   So anytime you're dealing with data, there's always risks,
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:08.000]   both practical risks for stealing data,
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000]   as well as genuine legal risks.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.400]   And there's, you know, can you protect yourself?
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:15.240]   Yes.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.960]   So the legal risks, the advice there,
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:21.360]   is that if you want maximum legal protection
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.680]   with regard to an accountant,
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.800]   you need to hire an accountant who is both an accountant,
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:31.000]   i.e. CPA, and a lawyer.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.280]   There is an association,
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:34.320]   I can't state it off the top of my head,
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:37.800]   but there is an association of practitioners
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.360]   who are lawyer accountants.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.560]   That's what they are.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.320]   You will spend more money to work with one of them,
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.040]   but the big benefit that you get
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.720]   is that now your personal, confidential,
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:53.600]   financial information can be part of your client files.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:56.080]   So as long as you specifically follow
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:59.840]   all of the best practices to initiate a relationship
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.360]   where you're requesting legal advice,
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:06.800]   then now your files with your lawyer
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:08.600]   can now be privileged information,
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.720]   privileged for attorney-client communication.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:14.320]   And that is a good step that protects you from legal risk,
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.160]   and that is wise.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.400]   So if you have a reason to believe that that's necessary
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.200]   or a good idea for you, that would be the case.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.200]   Now, from a practical perspective also then,
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:28.200]   what you should do is quiz your lawyer accountant
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:33.320]   on what his or her standards are for information security.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:38.600]   And so there are increasingly superior protocols here
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:41.280]   for security.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:46.280]   And so you should quiz your lawyer accountant
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:49.120]   and find out, what do you do for data security?
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:50.480]   How do you protect your systems?
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.200]   How do you protect your computers?
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:55.240]   How do you protect your client's valuable information?
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.920]   And there should be something in place,
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:59.800]   what you're looking for is at least something.
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.280]   I don't think that in general,
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:04.160]   it's gonna ever be bulletproof or like airtight.
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:06.160]   No, there's always significant risks.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:08.080]   All of us have big cybersecurity risks
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.040]   that are undealt with,
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:11.960]   even though we should and could deal with them.
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:14.080]   There are solutions out there, but we don't do them.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:14.920]   But what you're looking for
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.160]   is at least somebody who's given some thought to it,
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.360]   at least somebody who has full disk encryption on a device.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.520]   So if the device is stolen from his office,
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:24.080]   it doesn't immediately do that.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.720]   Someone who's using good protocols
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:27.840]   and good secure storage mechanisms
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:32.000]   and has some way of holding keys and passphrases.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.920]   And then you can also engage in good data hygiene yourself,
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.000]   and that would be important.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.680]   So using the proper QuickBooks Online login
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:42.120]   rather than emailing stuff back and forth
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:44.280]   would be important.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:47.040]   And so you're looking, I think, not for perfection,
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.160]   but you're looking for somebody
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.040]   who basically makes you feel good
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.440]   by the fact that he's thought about it,
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:55.920]   that he's got a plan in place, at least some kind.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.280]   In reality, though, that was all the technical answer.
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:02.600]   The practical answer is it probably
[01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:03.920]   just doesn't matter that much,
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:06.120]   especially with what I think you were hinting at.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:08.080]   If you print out a profit and loss statement
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.480]   of your business and a balance sheet,
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:12.600]   and you go trotting around accountant's offices
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.040]   and you start plunking that down,
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:16.560]   an hour after you leave,
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.040]   the accountant is not gonna remember any of the data
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.520]   just because it doesn't matter.
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:24.480]   And so I would say it's kind of like seeing people naked.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:26.480]   If you walked into the office next door to you
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:27.800]   and there's a woman standing there naked,
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.720]   you're probably gonna remember that.
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:31.640]   But if you're a doctor and you see naked people
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.160]   standing in front of you all day long,
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:35.440]   it's just kind of, it's all the same.
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.800]   It's another naked person.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.640]   And so having been a financial advisor,
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.800]   the same thing basically happens with money,
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:42.360]   is that when I first started and like,
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.080]   oh, wow, now I know how much money someone earns.
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.320]   After a time, you just entirely stop caring.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.880]   You're completely immune to it.
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:51.640]   And unless there's something that's radically different,
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:53.320]   you just, it's just another person.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:56.040]   And it's not like it's impressive or memorable.
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:58.680]   So I don't think there's much risk of you walking around town
[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:01.440]   and taking out your balance sheet
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.560]   and your profit and loss statement and talking about it
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:05.600]   and sharing what you're looking for.
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.760]   But if you want the protection,
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:10.080]   the technical answer is lawyer accountant.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:14.880]   - Okay, yeah, I think the,
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:17.640]   I appreciate both of the technical and the real answer.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:21.160]   I think the concern is we haven't entered
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:24.280]   into a formal business relationship with this person.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:25.960]   And I was wondering if, in your opinion,
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:28.200]   that is necessary before we share anything.
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:30.520]   - No, I don't even know what that would mean.
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:35.720]   - Yeah, I'm not sure either.
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:37.440]   I guess that's where the question's coming from,
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:40.080]   is what is normal here since it's my first bet,
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:43.200]   first go around with this as an entrepreneur.
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.480]   - I would say what you should try to do
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.400]   is to get as clear as possible on what you're looking for.
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:49.440]   So are you looking for tax preparation?
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:51.000]   That's very different than I'm looking
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.480]   for proactive business advice or proactive tax advice.
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.400]   So get an idea of what you're looking for
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:58.080]   and then go and start interviewing people.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.000]   And then I would just share kind of big picture numbers.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.520]   We have a business that does X amount of dollars in revenue.
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:06.800]   We have profit margins of about this much.
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.280]   We have this number of employees.
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:09.640]   Here's what we're trying to accomplish.
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.440]   We're trying to get this, this, this.
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.440]   What could you offer?
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:13.760]   How could we work together?
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:15.000]   And I don't see why there would be
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.240]   any kind of formal agreement
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:19.400]   before you would have those conversations.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:24.120]   - We've had some of that conversation already.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:27.480]   It is gonna be a lot of tax related stuff
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.640]   since this is still a sole proprietorship.
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.280]   So that's definitely the starting point.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:39.400]   - Good, so I don't think you're disclosing
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.240]   huge amounts of information there.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.280]   And I don't think there's a big risk.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.240]   If you want to have it iron tight,
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:49.000]   then do all of this consultation with a lawyer.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.480]   So for example, if you're a sole proprietor
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:52.520]   and you're thinking about,
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:54.200]   should I establish a corporation?
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:55.640]   That's a legal question.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.720]   Now, obviously your accountant will comment on it,
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:59.240]   just like I used to comment on it,
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:02.120]   just like I comment on it when people call me and ask me.
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:04.520]   But technically speaking, that's a legal question.
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.960]   You should have an understanding of the tax considerations,
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:08.680]   but that's a legal question.
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:11.520]   And so you would engage the services of a business lawyer
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:13.000]   to give you specific advice.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.000]   And then in that context, when you engage the lawyer,
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.120]   then you will have attorney client privilege
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.240]   for your privileged business information.
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:27.040]   - Okay, got time for one more?
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.160]   - Sure, go ahead real quick.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:32.640]   - So we are eligible for a grant for our business.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:36.080]   And the terms of that grant allow us to pay ourselves back
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:40.320]   for costs that we've incurred in the past for the business.
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:46.560]   Would it make sense to keep the funding from the grant
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:47.960]   for future business expenses,
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.560]   or to pay ourselves back for things
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.120]   that we've paid out of pocket?
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:56.480]   - Do you see a reason to pursue one path or another?
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.800]   - Refilling our coffers a little bit,
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:04.160]   since we've paid it, everything personally so far,
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:05.200]   due to the nature of the business,
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.960]   which operates out of our house.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.520]   But I could see value in just kind of holding that
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:15.800]   for improvements to the business,
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:17.760]   growing the business in the future,
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.520]   and we don't have an immediate need for the money
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:21.760]   if we were to reimburse ourselves.
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:23.160]   Maybe that's my answer.
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:26.800]   - Yeah, I think if you don't see a way
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.160]   to actively use it in the immediate future,
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:31.680]   then filling the personal coffers,
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:33.280]   including things like making sure
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:35.760]   that you're making retirement account contributions,
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.240]   things like that, I think are important.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:40.200]   Every calendar year that passes,
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:41.440]   you lose the ability to make
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.360]   a retirement account contribution.
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:44.520]   And as a business owner,
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:47.520]   you really don't wanna miss those, if at all possible,
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.840]   because that's what keeps you going
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.000]   if your business goes into bankruptcy.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.680]   That's what allows you to start again,
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.840]   is having money in your retirement accounts.
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:59.120]   So even if the terms of the grant
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.160]   didn't allow you to actually make
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.920]   a retirement account contribution,
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:04.640]   but if it does allow you to pay yourself back,
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:07.120]   then pay yourself back, lower your current income
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:08.800]   so that you can defer into retirement accounts,
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:09.960]   things like that.
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:10.880]   Now, if we're talking about
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:12.680]   significantly more money beyond that,
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:14.160]   I would again go back to, I think,
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:17.440]   the good framework here is to think about bankruptcy planning.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:19.680]   If I went through bankruptcy, what would be available?
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:22.720]   So if you live in a state that allows you
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:24.720]   to have a high homestead exemption
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.520]   on your personal residence, well, pay down your mortgage.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.760]   And then if you need the money to expand the business,
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.920]   you could always choose to go out
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.400]   and refinance the mortgage in the future.
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.160]   And again, speaking conceptually here
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:39.040]   about the value of bankruptcy-proof assets
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:41.920]   for a business owner as being a really valuable thing
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:44.720]   to think about, not giving specific advice
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.840]   about you paying down your 2.7% mortgage
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.400]   to refinance it at 9% in the future
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:49.760]   when you need the money out.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:53.000]   But beyond that, I mean, taking profits
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.640]   and actually having made money
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:57.800]   if it's in the terms of the grant is always a good idea,
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.880]   but you're gonna wanna expand.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.680]   And so having the money available to you
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:04.720]   for expansion is good.
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:06.200]   So I could argue both ways.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:08.760]   I would focus on what I said of retirement accounts
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.600]   or other exempt assets as a way
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:13.520]   of just kind of leveraging yourself up a little bit
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:16.400]   and making sure you're building on a solid foundation
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:19.600]   and then look for ways to invest it to grow the business.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:23.320]   - Okay, perfect, I appreciate it.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:24.400]   - My pleasure.
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:25.240]   Fun questions.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:27.640]   That concludes our Friday Q&A show for today.
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.240]   Really interesting set of questions.
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:32.080]   I thank you for the interesting discussion.
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:34.640]   As always, I had two or three other callers that came on,
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.720]   but I guess I didn't get to them.
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:37.920]   So just know that generally I get to you.
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:39.200]   I work through everyone who's on the line,
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:40.360]   even if it takes a while.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:42.000]   And remember, if you'd like to join me on next week's show,
