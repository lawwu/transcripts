[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   One of the most asked about themes in the inbox
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.120]   is God's hardening of the sinner's heart.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.640]   It's an incredible theme throughout Romans
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.900]   and no chapter of scripture has inspired more APJ questions
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.580]   than Romans 9 has.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.780]   We now have over 400 emails on this chapter alone,
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.560]   loads of questions, including this really good one
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.840]   from a listener named Nate.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.100]   Hello, Pastor John, I was recently reading Romans 1,
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.480]   verses 24 to 27, and Paul seems to be saying
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.840]   that God gave over these sinners to dishonorable passions
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.800]   as a consequence of their sin.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.840]   But then when I got to Romans 9, verses 1 to 29,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.120]   Paul seems to indicate that God himself hardens sinners
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.440]   in unbelief, God hardens whom he wills.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.700]   That's chapter 9, verse 18.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.160]   So in the case of Romans 1, did God first harden
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.000]   these sinners before he gave them up
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360]   to dishonorable passions?
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.400]   Which came first, did the sinners harden their own hearts
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.560]   or did God harden their hearts?
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.360]   In thinking back to the Old Testament,
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.920]   God first promised to harden Pharaoh's heart.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.420]   It's Exodus 4, 21 and 7, 3.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.940]   And then Pharaoh hardened his own heart
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.480]   in Exodus 8, 15 and 32.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.700]   Then God hardened his heart even more
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.120]   in Exodus 9, 12.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.040]   Then Pharaoh hardened his own heart even more
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.520]   in Exodus 9, 34.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.160]   Then God hardened his heart even more
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.240]   in Exodus 10, 1, 20 and 11, 10.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.880]   How does this dynamic work more generally in culture?
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.980]   Or is the giving over in Romans 1
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.640]   and the hardening of Pharaoh's heart
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   different categories altogether?
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.560]   Pastor John, how would you respond to Nate
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.480]   in putting Romans 1 and 9 together?
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.440]   - The first thing I want to say is that
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   there is no hardness in the human heart against God,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.100]   either from God's decree or from human depravity,
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.060]   which is so hard that God himself cannot overcome it
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.620]   and save the hardest sinner.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.060]   This is the very heart of the new covenant promise
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.420]   of Ezekiel 11, 19.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.820]   I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.760]   and give them a heart of flesh.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   Nothing is too hard for the Lord, Jeremiah 32, 17.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.340]   Now I start here because I know
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.620]   that thousands of people listening
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.020]   have friends and family who have been resistant
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.780]   to the gospel for years
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.420]   and how easy it is to despair
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.300]   that they could ever be saved.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.540]   They're just too hard.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.240]   So our hearts tempt us to believe.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.660]   But what I want to stress here at the outset
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.780]   is that it is the very omnipotence,
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.820]   the very sovereignty and freedom of God
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.460]   who says, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.220]   and I will harden whom I harden."
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.940]   It's that very freedom and power,
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.180]   which is our only hope
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.900]   that the seeming impossibility of human hardness
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.700]   cannot stand before the mercy of the sovereign God.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.500]   That's where I want to start.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.580]   Now, let's look at the specific question,
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.580]   namely, did God first harden the sinners in Romans 1, 24, 26,
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.780]   28, before he gave them up to dishonorable passions?
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.340]   Let me quote one of those verses, verse 28.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.940]   "Since they disapproved of having God in their knowledge,
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.140]   God gave them up to a debased mind
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.020]   to do what ought not to be done."
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.020]   So it's clear that there is a sinful, rebellious condition
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.340]   prior to God's giving them over to a debased mind.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.700]   In other words, his removing the restraints
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.460]   that he often puts on sinners and sinful cultures
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.940]   is not the ultimate origin of their rebellion.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.260]   That removal is not the ultimate origin of their rebellion.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.620]   That was there before he handed them over
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.040]   to their own rebellion by removing all restraints.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   So what was their condition before this handing over,
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.460]   or you could say this hardening?
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   What was their condition before that?
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.460]   Now, let's let Paul describe it in Ephesians 4, 17 and 18.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.740]   It says this, "You must no longer walk as the Gentiles do.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.100]   In the futility of their minds,
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.460]   they are darkened in their understanding,
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.540]   alienated from the life of God
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.080]   because of the ignorance that is in them
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.940]   due to the hardness of heart."
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.780]   So Paul traces the condition of Gentiles,
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.940]   that's virtually all of us,
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.500]   and he's gonna say in a minute
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.960]   that includes the Jewish people as well.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   He traces our condition back through futile minds,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.460]   through darkened understandings,
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.780]   through alienation from God,
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.500]   through ignorance, and finally,
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.940]   at the bottom, to hardness of heart.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.780]   That's the root problem.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.540]   And Paul makes plain that this hard spiritual deadness
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.200]   is universal for Jew and Gentile, not just Gentiles,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.820]   because he says in Ephesians 2, 1 to 3,
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.420]   "You," namely you Gentiles, "were dead in trespasses
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.140]   and sins in which you once walked
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.820]   following the spirit that is now at work
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.500]   in the sons of disobedience, among whom we,"
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.440]   and he's now including Jews, including himself,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.180]   "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.420]   carrying out the desires of the body and the mind,
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.420]   and were by nature the children of wrath
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.140]   like the rest of mankind."
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.920]   Now, here's a great mystery.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.380]   We may not be able to fully explain it,
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.260]   but here it is in Scripture, namely,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.540]   what humans are by nature
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.540]   fits us for God's just wrath.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.760]   They were by nature, quote, "children of wrath
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.320]   like the rest of mankind."
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.040]   This is the condition of every human being.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   We are by nature sons of disobedience, verse two.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.440]   That is, by nature we disobey.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.480]   It's our nature to disobey.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.920]   By nature we rebel.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.320]   By nature we are selfish and God-ignoring
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.100]   and God-belittling, and therefore,
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   by nature we deserve God's wrath.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.080]   Now, how did that come about,
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.760]   that all human beings are by nature
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.880]   justly subject to the wrath of God
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.360]   because of our proneness to disobey and rebel,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.160]   sons of disobedience?
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.080]   And Paul's answer in Romans 5 is that Adam's sin
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.040]   has infected his race.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.680]   That is, the punishment that fell on Adam
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   fell on all who are part of Adam as his descendants.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.300]   Here's how Paul puts it in Romans 5:18.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.520]   One trespass led to condemnation for all.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   By one man's disobedience, the many were appointed sinners.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.940]   So the answer to the question,
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.660]   did God first harden the sinners of Romans 1
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.460]   before he gave them up to dishonorable passions?
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.020]   The answer is, in this sense, yes.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.020]   God passed judgment on the whole human race in Adam.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:32.380]   Our hardness is owing to God's judgment
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.860]   on the whole human race in our forefather Adam.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.820]   This hardness or deadness or futility,
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.820]   which we all have from Adam on, is basic.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.820]   All other texts in the Bible about God's hardening,
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.300]   have this as their backdrop,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.980]   which means that any given case of hardening
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.820]   may mean that God is giving someone up to the hardening
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.300]   that God decreed from the beginning.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.460]   And the reason I say from the beginning
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.140]   and decreed from the beginning
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.300]   is that Paul says in Romans 11, verse five,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.460]   "At the present time, there is a remnant,"
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.400]   namely of believing Jewish people,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   "There is a remnant according to the election of grace.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.620]   But if it is by grace,
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.820]   it is no longer on the basis of works,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.980]   otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.820]   What then?
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.260]   Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking,
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.580]   but the elect obtained it,
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.540]   and the rest were hardened."
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.580]   So Paul traces the deliverance from hardness
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.140]   back to the election of grace,
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.200]   which happened before the foundation of the world.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.120]   He chose us in him before the foundation of the world,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   Ephesians 1.4.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.460]   So from the beginning,
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.520]   that is the very beginning of God's eternal planning
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.360]   before creation, from the beginning,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.140]   he chose to save his people through Christ
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.660]   from this condition of hardness,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.660]   which means we should be very, very thankful
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.680]   that our eyes are open to the truth and beauty of Christ
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.940]   and that our heart of stone has been taken out
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.140]   because we did not bring this about ourselves.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.140]   This rescue from hardness was a sovereign work of God
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.960]   who chose us before the foundation of the world
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.800]   to be his soft, believing children.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.540]   Now, with regard to the other question raised,
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.140]   namely, how does this work in culture?
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.620]   I mean, that's another world he opens up
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.460]   kind of at the end there.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.740]   He just throws that one in.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.500]   Are you kidding me?
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.560]   You're gonna throw that question in here
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.160]   on top of this?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.540]   How does this work in culture?
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.320]   So let me just close with one observation.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.780]   In view of Romans 1, 24, 26, 28,
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.920]   it is naive to look at culture
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.560]   sinking deeper and deeper into sin,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.060]   which I believe ours is,
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.060]   and to say only that this culture is ripening for judgment.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.760]   Well, that's true,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.900]   but it conceals another more fundamental truth,
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.220]   namely, the sinking deeper and deeper
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.220]   into the bondage of sin itself is God's judgment.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.740]   That's the point of Romans 1, 18.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.740]   The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.980]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.080]   who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.420]   That suppression is the handing over of God,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.000]   which is a manifestation of his judgment and his wrath.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   So the sinking of individuals and the sinking of cultures,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.220]   even the disappearance of cultures
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.620]   into more and more blatant sin
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.140]   is always owing both,
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.140]   one, to our natural hardness of heart against God,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.980]   and two, God's giving us over to that hardness.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.300]   There is one hope through the gospel,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.860]   because God promises in the new covenant,
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.820]   which is a gospel promise in Ezekiel 11, 19,
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.820]   I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.120]   and give them a heart of flesh.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.840]   That's our prayer.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   That's our cry for ourselves, our friends, our family,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.460]   and whole cultures that God would take out
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.980]   the heart of stone.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.740]   - Yeah, such an important dynamic to understand in scripture
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.900]   and then to see applied in broader culture today.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.500]   And thanks for listening.

[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.260]   On Monday, we hear from a listener to the podcast
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.860]   who recently sought after a prostitute
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.900]   and is now devastated at this decision.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.540]   Even in seeking a prostitute,
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:55.540]   has he crossed a line for which he cannot return?
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.000]   Pastor John will address that when we return
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.420]   on Monday next week.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.260]   Thank you for listening.
