[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   What I think is the biggest law in personal finance is that you can...
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.560]   That cutting spending is a reliable path to building wealth.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.520]   And I just don't think the data suggests that at all.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.200]   Like, yes, you can cut spending.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.280]   It's like a short-term workaround, but it doesn't build wealth over the long run.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960]   I mean, just consider this. Very simple.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.400]   Like, if you look at the data,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.200]   one of the most positively correlated things with savings rate is your income,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.640]   like your absolute level of income.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.040]   Like people with... And you're gonna say, "Well, Nick, this is so obvious."
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.760]   Well, it's so obvious, but yet people are still pushing this cutting spending argument.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.720]   It's like people with higher incomes generally save more money.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.920]   That is just across the board.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.880]   The higher rate, they're even saving a higher percentage of their income.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.840]   And the reason is simple.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.960]   Like incomes go up, but your spending doesn't move with it.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000]   It's like law of the stomach.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.040]   If I increase your income 10x, are you gonna spend 10 times more on food?
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.080]   Probably not, right?
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080]   Are you gonna spend 10 times more on housing?
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.120]   Maybe, but probably not.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.480]   Maybe you'll spend 8 times more on housing.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.880]   I don't know.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.440]   But you see people generally earn more and more money.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.800]   They don't spend more and more.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.440]   And you're like, "But Nick, I know someone that had...
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.400]   I know this rich person.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.360]   I know this person has high income.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.920]   They spend a lot."
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.040]   Yes, you know these people.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.760]   You know a handful.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.720]   You can think of anecdotes.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.160]   I know people like that too.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.080]   But the data suggests if you're looking across aggregated data sets across most people
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840]   that that is just not true.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.000]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.720]   A show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.960]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.760]   With all that's happening in the markets right now,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.440]   it had me thinking a bit about my guest from episode 6, Morgan Housel,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.400]   who talks about how volatility in the stock market
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.320]   should be viewed more as a fee for admission than necessarily a fine.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.680]   I think that's a really helpful perspective, especially given what's going on.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's currently mid-May 2022.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.480]   We're getting awfully close to bear market.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.360]   So today, I want to bring on Nick Maggiuli,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.760]   who shares a similar sentiment to Morgan and has written about it on multiple occasions.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.080]   He's the COO at Ritholtz Wealth Management,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.520]   but he's also a writer, investor, and data scientist who regularly uses data
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.920]   to produce insights and great content about investing and personal finance
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160]   on his blog of Dollars & Data.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160]   And he recently released his first book,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.000]   Just Keep Buying, Proven Ways to Save Money and Build Your Wealth.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800]   He's covered a lot on his blog and in his book,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.200]   but I'm really excited to dig into his focus on income producing assets,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.600]   why you might not want to max out your 401(k), investing during a downturn,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   getting comfortable with spending more, and why you'll probably never feel rich.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.440]   But I want to start with volatility.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.640]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.000]   Nick, thank you for being here.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   Thanks for having me on, Chris. Appreciate it.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.760]   So you talk about volatility in the market being the price for admission
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.680]   for people interested in buying stocks.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.000]   How do you think people should be thinking about this?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.840]   I agree completely.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.960]   It is like a fee for admission, except the fee isn't paid.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.640]   You don't actually have to necessarily pay it.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   If you hold for a long enough time in a diverse set of income-producing assets,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.160]   you never have to physically pay it.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.440]   You pay it with your emotional costs of holding through all that stuff.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.400]   And so it's more of a...
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   I'd say it's more of a mental fee than it is an actual fee like a financial transaction fee.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.000]   So keeping that in mind is what's important.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.480]   I think the thing for me that just allows me to stay calm when markets are crashing,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.360]   and especially like...
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.040]   I've just seen this happen so often.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.880]   Actually, tomorrow, I'm writing a blog post about this.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.600]   It's just like...
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.920]   I've been investing for 10 years and on average,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.200]   the market declines by a little over 10% every other year.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.000]   30% every 4 to 5 years and 50% once a generation.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.160]   So let's say every 20 to 25 years.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.120]   We did have two 50% declines in the 2000s.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.760]   There was the dot-com followed by the Great Recession,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.720]   but the last 50% decline before that was '74.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.160]   So this is all on average.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.760]   But if it's happening every other year, then you shouldn't be panicking over this
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.040]   because these types of things just happen.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.000]   There's going to be different catalysts, different reasons that cause them.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.960]   But that's why I can be like, "Hey, this stuff happens."
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.040]   It's just like the nature of markets and it's going to keep happening that way.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   And what do you say to someone who's like, "Gosh, it feels like it could get even worse.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.400]   Maybe I should get out before it bottoms."
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   Let's say you do it.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.800]   Let's say you do get out before it bottoms.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.880]   Like, "Wow. Okay. I got out. Maybe I saved...
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.040]   Maybe it goes down another 10%, right?"
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.480]   But how do you know when the bottom's in?
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.840]   How do you know when to get back in?
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.640]   That's the problem.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.600]   It's like you have psychological hell on the exit,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.520]   and you have psychological hell on the re-entry.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.000]   So, it's not even about trying to time it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.160]   That's why it's very difficult to do.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.720]   But even if you got lucky on one side of the trade,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.640]   you may get unlucky on the other side of the trade,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.720]   and you end up not making anything in the long run.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.440]   Imagine you sold in early March 2020.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.760]   Looking back now, that looks like a good idea.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.120]   But when did you get back in?
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.800]   Within 6 months, we were at all-time highs.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.360]   Did you get back in before you passed your old price?
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.280]   Probably not, right?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.000]   And that's the thing.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.680]   Because it would happen so quickly,
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.760]   it's really hard to predict that stuff.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.040]   So, I don't recommend those types of all-or-nothing type of moves.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.240]   If you are getting worried,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.880]   I say make minor, very, very minor tweaks.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.400]   Just enough to get you to sleep at night,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.720]   but not so much that you jeopardize your financial future.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.160]   So, that's my hack there.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.240]   If you're going to sin, sin a little.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.960]   Don't sin a lot.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.320]   That's where people make big mistakes
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.920]   when they start moving everything too much
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.240]   based on short-term changes in information.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.560]   And what would be a minor tweak?
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.400]   Let's say I do like a 60/40.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.160]   I bought every month in my 401(k)
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.720]   and putting 60% into stocks, 40% into bonds.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.680]   A minor tweak would be like,
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   "Okay, I'm going to flip that.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.800]   I'm going to put 60% into bonds, 40% into stocks."
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.360]   That's my new...
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.280]   So, it's a little change.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.720]   Obviously, it's a small change in money.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.160]   You're still investing in stocks,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.280]   but you're doing it at a slower rate
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.520]   and you're putting more into bonds on the predictive front.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.400]   Or just even having a rebalance, rebalancing back.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.320]   If stocks have fallen a lot and bonds haven't,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.160]   rebalancing back, that can also do things.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   There's a lot of different ways of doing this.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.840]   And there's no right answer, right?
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.200]   Every person is going to feel differently.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.000]   Someone's like, "I'm not going to feel safe if the market drops another...
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.440]   If I lose another dollar in the market."
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.160]   Well, it's like...
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.760]   And you shouldn't have had that money invested.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.160]   The truth is, now you know your actual risk tolerance.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.080]   You shouldn't have had that money invested in the first place.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.280]   But hey, you're here now.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.400]   And if that's true, then yeah,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.320]   you probably do need to get out completely
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   because you didn't realize your risk tolerance.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.960]   You should have had a very different portfolio before this happened.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.240]   I think a lot of people think, "Okay.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.080]   Well, the stock market goes up always.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.000]   So, there's not really that much risk."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.360]   But you say, "Sometimes the biggest risk you can take
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.560]   is not taking risk."
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.600]   Can you talk a little bit more?
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.680]   Yeah. It's like there's these...
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   I guess you can look at it as 2 types of risk.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.520]   There's slow risk and fast risk.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.440]   Now, I would define as fast risk as something like the stock market crashes.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.480]   It happens very quickly.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.680]   It's COVID-19, the world shutting down, all that stuff.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.560]   Those are all types of fast risk that happen very quickly, right?
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.040]   Slow risk is something that accumulates over a long time.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.720]   So, I think the analogy I like to use is with drugs, right?
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.760]   So, someone doing heroin, they're taking on fast risk.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.440]   They're probably going to overdose relatively quickly.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.200]   They're not going to be doing heroin for 20 years.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.080]   And then they get, I don't know, heroin cancer.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.520]   I know that's not an equivalent, right?
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.960]   There's no cancer you can get from heroin.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.880]   But they're going to get some sort of cancer then die.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.720]   But smoking is slow risk, right?
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.520]   That's someone who...
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.680]   You smoke a cigarette, nothing's going to happen from that, right?
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.360]   You do it over 20, 30 years though,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.280]   you can see the incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   especially after a 20-year period, right?
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.520]   So, that's slow risk versus fast risk.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.600]   So, holding cash is slow risk.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.280]   You're sitting there and just holding that cash.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.360]   And that's just going to be dwindled away by inflation.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.560]   And so, the question is, which one's better?
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.080]   And there's no right answer,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.840]   but you have to figure out whichever risk you want to take.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.960]   So, "Oh, I'm going to sit this one out and sit through cash."
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.800]   Not only is your cash being inflated away,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.720]   but if the market does happen to move up...
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.520]   Like, for example, I had people in 2017 telling me that, "Oh, markets are overvalued."
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.840]   If you've been sitting in cash since then, you're down...
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.880]   You lost out on 100% gain, basically.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.360]   Even with the current decline, maybe 80%, 90% gain, right?
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.840]   So, it's like, what risk do you want to take?
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.360]   And where do you want to take it?
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.880]   That's the things you need to think about.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.720]   So, there's nothing wrong with sitting in cash.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.720]   But as long as you know, "Hey, I'm going to lose purchasing power over time by doing this."
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   As long as you've accepted that, let's say, 2% to 4%.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.160]   This last year, inflation has been 8%.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.800]   But that's generally not what happens over long periods of time.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.160]   Let's just say 4% a year.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.200]   You're willing to accept that haircut on your money, then that's fine.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.240]   But there's not going to be any fluctuation in the short term.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.200]   Very little fluctuation.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.320]   But that's what you have to deal with.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.320]   One thing you mentioned in there, which I just want you to drill down a little bit more,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   is about trying to use that cash to time the market.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.240]   I think I always thought, "Okay, let's leave some cash on the sidelines,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.680]   so that when the market's down..."
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.840]   Which, of course, is very hard to predict.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   But we're in a situation like that now, you can put it to work.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.240]   But given how long it might take for that to happen,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.920]   it sounds like it's not actually, from the data, the best decision.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.520]   No, it's definitely not.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.480]   I mean, 80% of the time, you're going to underperform if you follow a strategy like this.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.400]   There are cases where it does outperform.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.680]   So the time when it's best to hold cash is right before a big dip.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.520]   And then you have to time it pretty well to buy into that dip.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.000]   But the problem is dips are rare.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.680]   And big dips are especially rare.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.480]   If I had to go back and said, "How many 50% drawdowns have we had?"
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.520]   Or even let's just say 33% drawdowns, like what we had in COVID.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.320]   It was 2020.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.520]   The one before that was '08.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.360]   The one before that was 2000.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.760]   I think the only one before that, maybe '87, we got to down 33 with everything.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.800]   I don't know if we did.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.240]   The time before that was '74.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.040]   So they're very rare.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.400]   And we keep going back through time.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.440]   It's not a history lesson.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.240]   But you get my point.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.720]   Because they're so rare, the strategy doesn't work.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.080]   Because you're sitting there in cash, hoping for this dip that never usually comes.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.760]   And so then you've just lost out on market gains that you could have had, basically.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.440]   That's the whole issue with trying to time.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.520]   And I think what you said was, if you were sitting around in 2017,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.880]   thinking things are overvalued, and you waited,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.520]   even if you timed the dip, you wouldn't come out ahead.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.320]   Is that right?
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.720]   Even if you started at the beginning of 2017.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.440]   And let's say you bought, like you held cash the whole time.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.040]   And you bought at the exact bottom on March 23, 2020.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   That was the most recent bottom, at least.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.440]   Even if you perfectly timed that, you still would have bought at prices 7% higher
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.600]   than what you could have gotten early 2017.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.160]   Of course, if you had done that, that's still an incredible trade.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.360]   It's insane that you could do that.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.600]   But the fact that you were going to A, know the bottom, time it.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.120]   I'm giving you so many benefits of the doubt.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.120]   It doesn't really work that way.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.160]   So yeah, I don't recommend trying to time the market.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.040]   It's tough.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.920]   It's just too tough.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.040]   I mean, even if you...
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.160]   I've shown some evidence that if you can do it even somewhat okay,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.840]   you might be able to make some money on it.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.880]   But it's really tough.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.560]   And most people can't do it over the long run.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.320]   You just end up losing out.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.440]   What do you say about now?
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.760]   Now, we're not trying to time the market, but we are in a down market.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.400]   I don't think...
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.560]   Depending on what day this airs, maybe we hit bear market.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.440]   Maybe we recover.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.400]   And a lot of this is not relevant, which I guess we are all hoping for.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.160]   But when the market is down, when you're already in the down market,
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.440]   is there something to do differently?
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.520]   If you have a way of getting more cash, of course.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.800]   I think the difference between...
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.160]   I'm not against buying the dip.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.880]   I'm against holding cash and waiting to buy the dip.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.760]   They're very different things.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.240]   Because conditional on you being in a dip, let's say you just sold...
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.360]   I don't know.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.600]   You sold a business or you got an inheritance.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.520]   And by chance, you happen to get a big cash infusion when the market's down.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.440]   That is one of the best times to buy.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.920]   Because generally, if the market does recover as we expect it to over some period of time,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.600]   you're looking at higher expected returns.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.400]   And the math on this...
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.880]   I cover this in chapter 17 of the book.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.240]   The math on this is very simple.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.080]   So, let's just use the COVID example.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.040]   So, for every percentage decline, you need a larger percentage gain to get back to even.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.720]   This is just a mathematics.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.480]   So, let's say we're at 100 and the price goes down 33%.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.880]   So, something's at 100, it goes to 66.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.760]   To get from 66 back to 100, you have to go up 50%.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.480]   66 has to go up by 33 more roughly, which is a 50% gain.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.920]   So, X% drop requires a larger gain to get back to even.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.040]   So, if you had bought on March 23, 2020, all we need to do is figure out like, "Okay.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.680]   How long do you think it's going to take for the market to recover?"
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.840]   You have some estimates, some time estimate.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.400]   And then based on that, we can back out your expected return.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.440]   So, even if you thought it was going to take 5 years for the market to recover,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.800]   you're looking at a 50% upside over 5 years.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.480]   That's roughly 10% a year.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.040]   It's actually less.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.360]   The compounding, when you actually do the compounding math, it's less.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.640]   It's like 8.5% a year.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.600]   But let's just make it linear to make it easy for us mentally.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.720]   You're looking at 10% a year.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.880]   That's a pretty good return if it took 5 years.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.120]   Even if it took 2 years, you're looking at what?
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.080]   50 divided by 2, that's 25% a year returns.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.360]   You're like, "Who wouldn't want that?"
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.760]   So, if you think the COVID is going to recover in 2 to 3 years,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.600]   you're looking at some pretty good returns if you buy.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.040]   What actually happened?
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.280]   The market was back at all-time highs within 6 months.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.000]   You had something like a 106% annualized return,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.520]   which is like one of the greatest of all time.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.080]   Now, I'm not saying that that's going to happen here.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.880]   I don't know.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.440]   But that's the thinking you need to get into.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.160]   So, "Oh, we're 20% off the high, right?"
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.840]   To get back to even, let's say it's whatever, like 25%, right?
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.280]   If 100 went to 80, you'd have to go up by 20, which is 25% of 80.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.800]   So, you made a 25% gain.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.360]   Okay.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.920]   If you think it's going to take 2 years to get back to our old high,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.960]   let's say it takes 2 years, that's 12.5% roughly.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.240]   You know, doing the linear math there.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.840]   Do you not want 12.5% right now?
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   That's a pretty good return, right?
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.920]   All else equal.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.960]   But maybe it doesn't take 2 years.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.560]   Maybe it takes 5 years to get back to high.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.960]   Then you can see why it's not as good of a deal.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.520]   If you were to divide 25 by 5, that's only a 5% return, which isn't as great.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.840]   In the book, you said there's only 2 reasons to...
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.240]   Or there are 2 good reasons to take on debt.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.960]   One of them was when your expected return is higher than the cost.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.000]   Does that mean that it could be a good idea right now to borrow,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.760]   to invest when the market's down?
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.800]   Is there a risk there that's beyond the expected return that people should be thinking about?
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.080]   Yes.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.400]   I would not recommend that under most of almost all circumstances.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.240]   I think technically, yes, the expected return could be higher.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.840]   The problem is we don't know the future.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.400]   We could be at the beginning of a 5-year bear market.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.960]   And so borrowing money to then invest is a very risky proposition
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   unless you could easily pay off that debt.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.080]   Unless you're like, "You know what?
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.200]   I'm going to take this risk.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.920]   I'm going to lever.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   And even if it goes south, I can easily pay it off."
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.360]   You borrow like 2% of your net worth.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.880]   It's not some really small amount.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.760]   You could try that.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.480]   I don't think it's worth the hassle and effort and stress of that to do something like that.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.120]   But you're right.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.280]   If the drawdown was bigger, yes.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.080]   I don't think we're there yet.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   I mean, we barely hit 20.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   We were down 20, but now the market's rallied today.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.240]   And I don't know where it's going to be by the time this gets released, as you know.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.920]   So I don't know.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.000]   I think it's a risky proposition.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.440]   I don't recommend that type of stuff
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.160]   because you can get really wrecked by trying to lever up.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.640]   Yeah, I'm not here recommending it or proposing that you recommend it.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.320]   And the way I thought about it was, "Gosh, maybe if I had a certain amount of money,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.560]   I wanted to invest over the next three months.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.920]   Maybe I could invest those three months today and then just pay it back in two months."
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   I always say when you borrow money,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.240]   you need a plan to pay it back and you need to be comfortable with rates.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.720]   And a lot of borrowing against your portfolio, against your home...
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.760]   Like at Helix, sometimes those rates aren't fixed.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.880]   And so I will throw to anyone out there listening, thinking,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.440]   "Buying the dip, maybe I should borrow for the expected return."
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.080]   One, take all the advice you just gave.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.440]   And two, there are some expectations of interest rates going up,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.640]   which could mean that that equation of how much it costs to borrow is going up also.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.680]   So from my perspective, I don't think it's a timely or a wise thing to do.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.440]   But I thought I'd touch on it a little.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.240]   Yeah, I generally don't recommend that.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.880]   I'm saying if you have extra cash, that's investable cash.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.000]   I don't think for an emergency or anything, you have like, "Hey, I have extra cash by chance.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.600]   Go ahead and buy."
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.840]   But if not, I'd say, "Wait. Don't do anything like that.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.520]   Don't go beyond your means, basically."
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.640]   But another way to buy the dip, in a sense, could be to just rebalance.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.720]   If your stock portfolio is down significantly and you wanted to be at 80/20 and you're at 70/30,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.880]   you could sell some of those bonds when they're down and buy more stocks.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.480]   Yes, that's another way of doing this.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.080]   And obviously, it happens in the reverse too.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.160]   When stocks are like, people think they're overheated and you reverse back,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.200]   you sell some of the stocks to buy bonds, you can do the same thing there.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.720]   So it works both ways, right?
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.400]   It's a natural rebalancing process.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   And over time, there will be drift.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.160]   The higher return asset will eat most of the portfolio over time and so...
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.000]   Or become most of the portfolio over time.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.200]   So you'll have to just kind of rebalance periodically.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.520]   You know, maybe we're out of this whole thing by the time this comes out.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.600]   So I don't want to spend too much time digging on how to invest when the market's down.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.920]   But let's talk a little bit about what to invest in.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.520]   I think you focus a lot in the book on income-producing assets.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.640]   And when I heard that, I was like, "Hmm, I feel like I know what that is.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.240]   But I feel like maybe it would be better to get your definition."
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.800]   These are assets that actually produce some sort of cash flow.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.760]   They have some sort of fundamentals around how they're priced.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.120]   So what that means is they're not just priced based on what people feel.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.000]   Of course, how people feel about assets is going to change how they're priced.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.800]   That's true of stocks, bonds, crypto, anything out there.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.080]   That's going to be true, right?
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.800]   But income-producing assets have some sort of fundamental...
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.960]   There's some weight there, which is like the actual cash flows for that asset, right?
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.880]   Assuming they have cash flows, right?
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.480]   So I mean, you can think of it like...
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.160]   Imagine a suitcase with $50,000 in it.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.880]   We all could be sitting here debating the value of the suitcase.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.480]   But if we know there's $50,000 in that cash, that is a hard fact that we can use and be like,
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.560]   "Okay, the value of this suitcase should never go below $50,000, right?"
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.040]   I mean, historically, that actually is not true.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.920]   Because Warren Buffett used to buy something called NetNets back in the day,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.200]   which was like buying that $50,000 suitcase for $25,000.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   Because he would buy a company where the liquidation value of the company
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.680]   was worth more than what you could buy it for in the open market,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.560]   which is kind of like...
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.600]   That's like an arbitrage.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.800]   Those should never happen.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.160]   And today, they basically never happen because people are smarter now,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.120]   and then people have more data, and they're not allowing these types of things to happen.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.080]   But that's just an example of income-producing assets are just a
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.680]   fundamental weight that keeps prices in line.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.040]   And in the book, you outline a list of income-producing assets.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   And some of them, I think most people will be familiar with.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.960]   Things like real estate and stocks.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.280]   But one that I think most people aren't is royalties.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.640]   You can talk about that.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.760]   You can talk about farmland.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.040]   Are some of these more alternative income-producing assets,
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.440]   things that you talk about because they exist,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.720]   or you talk about because the average person might want to look into them?
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.800]   Well, I think it's something that people can consider looking into.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.120]   I don't think any single asset class is necessary to build wealth.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.360]   I think I've seen people do it with just real estate.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.880]   I've seen people do it with stocks.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.200]   I've seen people do it with farmland, etc.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.440]   There's no one that's required.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.640]   You don't need to have all these.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.080]   I'm just trying to expose people to different asset classes and different options.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.080]   I think, for example, in the case of farmland,
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   that's something that during most good times,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.720]   it's not really correlated as much with US stocks.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.880]   Of course, most risk assets will decline together.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.720]   That's going to probably be farmland as well.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.000]   But the thing about farmland is it's just a different return stream.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.640]   And so because of that, it's going to behave differently than stocks.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.480]   So that's something to kind of keep in mind.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.880]   It's like, "Hey, how am I diversified? And what do I own?"
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.160]   So I don't think there's any reason why you need to use those.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.800]   You don't have to.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.040]   I just want to expose people to different ideas out there.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.320]   And just because they're like, "Oh, that's kind of cool."
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.520]   If you're a big music fan, I could understand why you might want to own royalties.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.120]   I think there's a personal reason for that.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.400]   I'm a big music fan.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.920]   I think that's something I'll get into eventually.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.960]   I think there's a lot of accredited investor rules and things around some of those things.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.920]   So you have to just wait until you can do that unless the rules change.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.600]   But that's just something to keep in mind.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.760]   And for anyone who doesn't know, royalties,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   you essentially can just buy the income from an asset like an album
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.960]   or an entire collection of albums and people sell these in private investor groups.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.840]   Is that right?
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.480]   Yeah, basically.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.480]   So you can say, "Hey, I want 10 years of royalties for this particular song."
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.280]   And let's say they're selling those royalties for, I don't know,
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   let's say 20 grand.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.360]   That's what they sell and you get 10 years of it.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.480]   But last year, the song made $5,000 in income.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.680]   So they would have paid you $5,000.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.440]   So next year, assuming the same...
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.960]   You're like, "Well, Nick, that's a great thing.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.680]   If I get $5,000 for the next 10 years, that's $50,000.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.600]   I only paid $20,000 for it. That's a great return."
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.360]   The problem is you don't know if the listens and streams
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.040]   and all those royalties are going to be $5,000 a year.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.400]   They might be declining over time.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.120]   You see the history and you need to guess about the future.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.680]   I mean, obviously, if one of those artists were to die or something,
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.560]   you would see a huge spike in the royalties in that one year.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.120]   Maybe the royalties would permanently be elevated.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.600]   You don't know.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.040]   And so you're guessing around the future.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.840]   But it's also a cultural investment.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.040]   I think it's more social than it is necessarily just the cash flows.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.480]   But they both definitely matter.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.040]   You said, "Don't buy individual stocks."
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.360]   But I'm curious if the message is more, "Don't trade stocks."
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.560]   And that if you want to buy 20 companies that you're excited about
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.520]   and build that basket of long-term investments,
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.040]   how do you feel about that approach?
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.360]   I think it's relative to the percentage of your wealth.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.920]   So if you're doing that with 5% of your net worth, go ahead.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.560]   If you're doing it for fun, go ahead. I don't care.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.720]   But if you're going to put the bulk of your wealth in 20 companies that you're crazy about,
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.760]   I think that is a less prudent strategy than owning an index fund.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.800]   Because the probability that those 20 companies are going to grow
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.160]   at the market rate over a long period of time is unlikely.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.360]   I mean, most companies die.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.480]   And the reason why you look at that chart of like, "Oh, here's the US economy."
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   Or $1 invested in stock for the last 100 years or the S&P 500 for the last 50 years.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.360]   That line isn't realistic because the companies in that line are always changing over time.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.920]   The companies that are falling behind fall out.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   And the companies that are rising up get added in.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.040]   It's like a momentum strategy.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.000]   People don't realize that.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.640]   So if you just do a buy and hold of 20 random companies,
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.320]   "I'm going to hold these for the next 40 years."
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.560]   Like half of those companies probably won't exist.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.240]   A couple of them will probably do really well.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.160]   But the question is, will those ones that do well offset all the ones that don't do well?
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.160]   And I don't know the answer to that, right?
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.720]   And so I don't recommend doing that for performance reasons.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.360]   But most importantly, I don't recommend doing it because like,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.560]   what I call the existential reasons, which is you don't know if you're a good stock picker.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.560]   And I can get into that whole argument if you want.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.360]   But unlike most endeavors where you can identify your skill, your talent pretty quickly,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.800]   with stock picking, we don't know.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.360]   You and I, Chris, can go pick a basket of stocks, come back a year.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.080]   And if yours outperforms mine, does that mean you're a better stock picker?
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.520]   I don't know.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.680]   I don't think we can say that with certainty after 1 year.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.360]   I don't think we can say it even after 5 years.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.800]   Maybe 10, we'd have enough of looking at our track records.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.760]   We could probably say something.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.240]   But after 1 to 2 years, no one knows, right?
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.720]   Just imagine someone who bought GameStop in July 2020, before the whole crazy
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.640]   WallStreetBets thing happened in early 2021.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.000]   They had a huge return but had nothing to do with why they picked the stock.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.040]   Had zero to do with their intuition about that, right?
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.400]   So I think there's a lot of luck here.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.280]   And that's what makes it tough.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.200]   You mentioned if we picked a basket of stocks, some won't be gone,
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.360]   which I think means it's maybe even more important to figure out when to sell.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.000]   So I want to talk about that a little because I think for me personally, it's tough.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.240]   You pick a stock, or you invested in crypto early on or something,
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.000]   where you have a little bit more of an attachment to it.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.680]   I don't have a particular attachment to VTI, the total stock market.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.440]   Nor do I want to stop holding it at any point.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.960]   But for all these other things that people might have invested in, in their 10-15%,
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.000]   how do you think people should think about selling them?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.040]   Or even if you work at a company, and you just have the stock in that company,
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.400]   and you have beliefs about it, how do you make it easier to sell?
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.320]   Either in advance when I know you could say, "This is my criteria."
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.160]   But maybe when you're not that smart or not that prepared in advance to have created criteria,
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.840]   how do you think about selling?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.560]   So I think there's 3 reasons to sell.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.000]   First reason, rebalancing.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.280]   Sometimes that's just a natural thing.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.800]   I don't think that's what you're asking in this question.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.080]   So we're going to put that aside.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.240]   The second reason is like, "Oh, let's say you want to..."
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.040]   The point of money, the point of investing is so you can live the life you want.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   So sometimes you need to sell stuff just because,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.080]   "Hey, I'm going on a vacation.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.480]   Maybe I want to do this, or I want to do something nice for somebody."
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.280]   You sell.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.880]   I also assume that's not what you're asking either.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.840]   So we're going to put that aside.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.120]   So rebalancing and funding your lifestyle, let's put those aside.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.080]   Reasons to sell.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.960]   The third reason I think you should sell is to get out of a
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   concentrated or losing position.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.400]   Both are very different things because it's amplifying your risk.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:38.880]   So if you have...
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.840]   I mean, it depends.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.080]   If you're...
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.520]   Let's say you work at a company.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.160]   You can think of that company paying you stuff as like a bond.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.440]   You'd like a bond income.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.320]   That's like the income you're getting from the company is like a bond.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.120]   It's just a payment.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.760]   You get every 2 weeks, you get your payment or your coupon payment.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.360]   Now, why would you also want to hold the equity?
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.840]   You're like, "But Nick, this would be the next big thing."
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.720]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.600]   I recommend finding what I used to...
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.280]   It's called the regret minimization framework.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.560]   That's not something I came up with.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.040]   Sell enough of it so that you can lock up some level of lifestyle.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.000]   And then anything above that, if you want to let it ride, go ahead.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.880]   But assume...
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.720]   I want you to imagine the future.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   If it goes to zero, how do you feel?
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.080]   If it triples, how do you feel?
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.400]   So sell the amount, the right amount such that no matter how the future unfolds,
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.080]   you're happy with your decision.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.440]   I think that's the best way to do it.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.280]   I think it's the only prudent way to do it.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.680]   Because trust me, I had someone close to me who got a bunch...
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.040]   They went public.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.920]   He saw his net worth shoot up by a lot of money.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.080]   We're talking high 6 figures.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.560]   But he was in a tech stock, a high growth tech stock.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.800]   And now that company has collapsed by like 80%.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.600]   So he's now seen his wealth drop.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.080]   And now that 6-figure position is still 6 figures,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.160]   but now it's very low 6 figures.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.560]   And so he's seen this happen because he didn't want to sell any of it
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.320]   because he thought it was gonna be the next big thing.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.320]   And I think he's having some regret because he should have sold
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.880]   probably some of it to lock up some lifestyle stuff.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.560]   And I didn't force him.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.760]   I just said, "Hey, here's what I would do.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.800]   But you can do whatever you want."
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.640]   And then they did what they wanted and that's it now.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.360]   So that's what to just think about is regret minimization.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.560]   That's the framework I would use.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.360]   So let's say you're holding one of those stocks.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.800]   And right now, it's down more than the market is on average.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.480]   There are a handful of tickers that are down, like you said, 80%.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.760]   Let's say you're like, "Okay, is there an argument to stay in them?"
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.680]   Because if the whole market recovers,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:29.360]   they're gonna recover at a rate that is maybe greater than the average market.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.200]   Is the argument stay in them?
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.800]   Is it stay to something diversified, but closer to that profile?
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:39.440]   Like NASDAQ, tech index fund or something like that?
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.760]   How do you think about when you lost a large percent diversifying
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.880]   into something that probably won't recover at the same rate if it recovers?
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.320]   Yeah. So that's the thing.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.600]   You don't know if it's going to recover.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.320]   And so the only thing you can use is historical data.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.400]   And I know if you look at the 1-year median return across any individual stock...
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.280]   I was using the Compustat database going to 1976.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.720]   The 1-year return is like 6%.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.280]   And the 1-year return on an index is 9%.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   So the probability that you're going to have one of these stocks,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.520]   it's going to have one of these returns, it's going to do better is low.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.640]   So it's more likely you're going to underperform just on...
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.440]   If we're picking stocks out of a hat, you're probably going to perform.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.920]   I hear your argument like, "But look, these ones are like high beta.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.000]   So when the stock market dips, they dip more.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.920]   But when the stock market comes back, they come back more."
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.640]   Well, maybe that was true in this last run
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.360]   because tech was really high and everything was going well.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.800]   But now maybe things have changed.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.680]   I mean, I can't give you an answer that's going to satisfy you
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.520]   because I'd be like, "Oh, yeah, of course, they're going to come back."
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.720]   And you don't know.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.920]   Like, the thing I like to think about is all the prices in the past
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.960]   could have just been imaginary.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.440]   Like all that stuff, we were all very bullish on tech and like,
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.480]   "Oh, COVID is taking over the world and we're never going to come out of our houses.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.280]   And this is everything."
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.720]   Like Zoom and Peloton, all these companies are now the future, right?
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.040]   And now that the world's kind of coming back to reality,
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.160]   like maybe that's not true.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.520]   And so maybe all those prices were like kind of imaginary in some respect.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.920]   So I don't know if we're going to see something like that.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.640]   Then again, like we could go into another pandemic.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.440]   I know it's crazy to say that.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.240]   Will you go to another pandemic and then those companies start to thrive again?
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:06.880]   I just don't know.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.240]   Like the future is so uncertain.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.440]   So I wouldn't...
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.080]   I mean, it's really tough to be in that space when you're down 80%.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.160]   It's like you have to just evaluate it going forward.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.080]   I would say evaluate on risk parameters and not necessarily trying to get all your money back
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.080]   because you should just assume you're not going to.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.400]   So what I'm doing, for example, I own 2 tech stocks.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.200]   I won't say what they are.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.560]   I'm not trying to pump them or anything.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.160]   By the end of the year, if they're still down bad,
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.840]   I'm going to sell them and just have them as a tax loss.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.280]   I'm holding through the end of this year.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   And if they come back, they do.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.600]   If they don't at all, I'm selling at the end of this year regardless.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.040]   And I'm just going to lock in the tax loss
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   because I can write that off against other gains.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.640]   So that's kind of how I look at it.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.760]   That's a good strategy.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.120]   Maybe I'm going to adopt that strategy for a handful of these small positions.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.200]   What about...
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.640]   You mentioned income-producing assets.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.240]   What about the other side of that equation?
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   Other than crypto or art or anything like that,
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.800]   where do those things kind of fit into investing?
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.120]   I hold roughly 10% of my investable assets in those different types of
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.640]   what I call non-income-producing assets.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.040]   So that actually does include most of the art and crypto.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.640]   And I actually also put private companies,
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.040]   even though companies could be income-producing,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.560]   I don't consider them income-producing.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.600]   I consider them just like...
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.000]   I have a couple of very small private investments,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.840]   like 1% of my net worth or something.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.280]   And those aren't income-producing.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.360]   So I always look at it like that.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.960]   And when the price is based completely on what people are willing to pay for it,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.520]   and there's no income, you kind of have to look at it that way.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.800]   So I'm not saying you can't make money in them,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.160]   and they're not good for risk reasons or a host of other things.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.960]   But I just think you need to keep it a smaller proportion in your portfolio because
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.400]   it's really hard to show how those are going to keep going up in value in the same way that
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.320]   income-producing assets go up in value.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.320]   There's a much more fundamental reasoning for why those should go up in value versus
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.280]   why art or crypto or anything else should go up in value.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.560]   So let's jump a little bit to where we put the money.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.360]   I think one of your contrarian takes in the book
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.240]   is that maybe you shouldn't max out your 401(k).
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.040]   Yes, that's one of my most contrarian takes.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   And I think it's a very disliked take, but some people see the value in it.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.880]   For someone listening, it's like, "Wait a second. Wait a second.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.960]   I've got my 401(k)."
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.520]   Let's set aside the match because I think we'll all agree that
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.320]   if your company is going to match your contributions, that's worth it.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.480]   But if they're not, why would someone listening who's not getting matched
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.280]   want to stop and say, "Maybe I shouldn't do this"?
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.040]   Well, I think the point of this is to actually just open the conversation up.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.880]   Because I looked and I was like,
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.560]   "9 out of 9 personal finance experts all said max your 401(k)."
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.920]   I was like, "Why? Is this true?"
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.600]   Maybe I should just look into the numbers and find out.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.240]   And you actually look at the after-tax savings you get from above the match, as you said.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.600]   So anything above the employer match was something like 0.7% a year.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.400]   That's assuming a 15% capital gains rate and a bunch of other assumptions.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.040]   But you're looking at 0.7% a year.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.440]   And some 401(k) plans have all-in fees of over 1%.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.560]   That means you're getting negative.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.960]   Those people are paying 1% to be in their 401(k).
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.920]   They're getting -0.3% a year tax.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.560]   They're paying a negative tax alpha, I guess you'd call it.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.520]   You're losing money just to be in their 401(k).
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.800]   They would be better off if they didn't put any money in there and just held that on the outside
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.240]   and put it in a brokerage account and got lower fee options.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.920]   So they could just manage it themselves.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.440]   And so I just wanted to open this up so that people would actually look at their 401(k)s
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.080]   and say, "How much am I actually paying? All-in fees, everything."
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.120]   And if it's anywhere near, let's say 0.7%, you need to definitely get out of there.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.080]   If it's 0.5%, then the question is,
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   "Is it worth the extra 0.2% a year to lock up your money to 59.5%?"
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.640]   And I don't know for all the excess money.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.680]   And I don't know what the answer is.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.800]   So that's...
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   And remember, I wrote about all this in the book.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.600]   I was just comparing a 401(k) to a brokerage account where it's post-tax money and all this.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.480]   What I didn't even consider, and I've since thought about since,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.240]   it's like in a brokerage account...
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.120]   Most people don't know this.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.920]   In a brokerage account, if your only income is capital gains,
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.520]   like dividends, capital gains, whatever,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.360]   and that's your only income for the year,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.720]   you can have $40,000 a year tax-free as a single individual.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.280]   If you include the standard deduction right now, it's like $50,000.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.400]   So if you're a couple...
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.160]   Now, multiply that by 2.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.760]   A couple... A retired couple right now,
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.240]   let's say they have a $2 million portfolio,
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.480]   and it's paying them $1 million a year in income,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.640]   like capital gains, dividends, etc.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.920]   And that's the only income they have there.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.520]   No Social Security, nothing else.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.480]   They can have 0% tax on all that money.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.520]   No taxes.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.040]   So now if you use that,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.360]   if you just have a well-managed brokerage account,
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.400]   that completely destroys maxing out a 401(k)
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.840]   because you're not putting money,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.600]   locking it up to 59 and a half.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.040]   And then it just makes absolutely no sense to do that
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.320]   when you can have a 0% tax-free,
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.640]   pulling money out of your brokerage account,
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.920]   which is wild to think about.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.800]   But that's a real thing.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.680]   You can look it up.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.640]   Yes, a couple can pull out about $100,000 a year tax-free,
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.680]   as long as their only income is capital gains.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.440]   And most people don't talk about that.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.400]   And that's something that...
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.800]   Now, going back, I would have added that into the book
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.920]   as another counter-argument.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.440]   But just think about that.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.520]   That completely changes the retirement landscape.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.120]   I'm like, "Do you need to max 401(k)?"
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.160]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.080]   Because if you can build a big enough portfolio
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.600]   outside of your 401(k),
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.240]   you can even do it and have a much better tax treatment as well.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.880]   I had Andy Ratcliffe, who started Wealthfront,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.040]   where I work on the show.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.520]   He has a similar take to you, but he added on.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.120]   And so go back and listen to that episode
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.800]   if you want to go deeper on this.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.080]   The cost of the liquidity,
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.560]   like the fact that if you need the money,
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.520]   you have to pay fees.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.040]   And there isn't an easy way to get the money out.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.320]   And his argument was that young people,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.080]   you don't know what you're going to need money for,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.120]   whether it's starting a company,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.160]   whether it's buying a home,
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.200]   whether something happens.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   And so his point was like, "If the fees don't make sense,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.880]   then it's a no-brainer that you shouldn't do it."
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.480]   And there are sites out there right now
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.360]   where I think you could just search 401(k) fee analysis.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.000]   And they'll tell you sometimes it's the account fee.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.560]   Sometimes it's these mutual funds that just get marked up.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.320]   It's like you could get the same fund somewhere else,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.120]   but we just charge you an extra half a percent.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.680]   But there's also a cost to liquidity
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.160]   and not having access to your money if you need it.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.280]   If you're not a good saver,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.560]   maybe that's actually a benefit.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.720]   Maybe if you can't access your money,
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.320]   it's probably better for you.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.120]   But if you're not...
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.480]   If you are a good saver,
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.800]   I think that's another factor that plays into it.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.920]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.520]   And I think so some people say,
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.360]   "Locking up your money is a feature, not a bug."
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.200]   And I agree for some people that don't have discipline.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.480]   This is not going to be a great idea
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.520]   because you're going to pull that money out
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.800]   and then probably spend it or something.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   So I completely understand that take.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.560]   There's some benefits that could be on a spreadsheet.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.680]   But yeah, I mean, that's my...
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.480]   That's why I even thought about looking into the numbers on this
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.440]   because I was like...
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.960]   I had the same issue where like,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.720]   "Oh, wow. I couldn't buy real estate right now
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.600]   because I locked up way too much money into my 401(k)
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.840]   that I probably should have just done the 4%,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.240]   got my match, and then had everything else on the outside."
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.080]   And I kind of regret that now.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.240]   That's why I'm just trying to get this idea to people,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.600]   especially young people who are like,
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.200]   "You're right. You don't know what you're gonna use the money for."
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.840]   And so just having that kind of in mind
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.800]   is kind of helpful, I think.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.120]   If you want to have a diverse portfolio,
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.360]   maybe there's some assets you put in your retirement account,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.880]   some you put in your Roth IRA,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.280]   some you put in your taxable account.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.400]   And for someone versed, it's kind of like asset location.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   Is that really a big deal?
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.360]   I think I saw somewhere that you either don't do it
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.760]   or it's not an important part of your investing strategy,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.000]   which made me question whether it's worth it.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.320]   I mean, there's two different ways of looking at it.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.720]   If you're trying to maximize every dollar,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.080]   there's an optimal way to do it.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.480]   And I can tell you, you want to put your highest growth assets,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   the things you think are going to grow the fastest,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.680]   let's say stocks.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   And let's say there's only two assets.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.120]   There's stocks, which are high growth.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.120]   And let's say they're bond, which are low growth.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.920]   In that scenario, you would put all your high growth assets
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.440]   into your non-taxable accounts.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.360]   Your 401(k) would be all stocks.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.760]   Your IRAs would be all stocks.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.080]   And then your bonds would sit in your taxable accounts
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.800]   where you have to pay whatever on the income that you're saying.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.760]   But Nick, they pay the income.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.240]   But if you actually look at the math, the high growth,
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.320]   it's going to-- all the taxes on the capital gains
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.760]   are going to be much bigger than any sort of income
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.720]   you're going to have to pay on a bond,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   especially with yields as low as they are today.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.000]   The income is very small.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.960]   So if you're trying to just go like maximize every dollar,
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.880]   there is an asset location argument to be made.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.480]   But if you want to do a convenience argument,
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.440]   which is what I care about,
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.760]   I just make all my accounts look basically the same, right?
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.440]   Like they're like carbon copies of each other
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.200]   in terms of the asset allocation.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.920]   I don't put the same funds in all of them.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.840]   And the reason I don't is for something
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.320]   because I do tax loss harvesting like once in a while.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.080]   And if you don't do that correctly,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.160]   this is where you kind of need a professional sometimes.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.040]   If you don't do that correctly,
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.320]   you can do something called a wash sale.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   And basically, you try to tax loss harvest like lock in a loss.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.440]   But then if you buy something like one of your IRAs,
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.240]   you buy the same thing.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.040]   It's all washed.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.080]   Like you would-- it's a very complex like topic.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.120]   I don't want to get into here.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.800]   But like it's one of these things where like
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.320]   you need to be careful how you do this.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.240]   So like I just recommend talking to a professional
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.600]   and kind of getting that type of advice
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.480]   because you're trying to do certain types of tax games in there.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.000]   You're going to have to just be careful what you do.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.120]   But just for ease of use,
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.000]   I like having the same allocation across all my accounts
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.680]   because then rebalancing is much easier
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.520]   because I can rebalance within an account.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.440]   If I have all my stocks in one account
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.720]   and all the bonds in another account,
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.400]   how do I get the money out of the 401(k)
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.280]   and into my brokerage?
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.400]   You can't do that.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.720]   So because that also makes it easier for rebalancing.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.760]   So for a host of reasons,
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.160]   I recommend the carbon copy model,
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.120]   cookie cutter model of asset location.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.520]   Yeah. When it comes to tax loss harvesting,
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.800]   one of the saddest emails I've ever gotten
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.280]   was from people while I was working at Wealthfront.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.480]   They're like, "Gosh, I've been running
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.760]   three robo-advisor portfolios
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.400]   and tax loss harvesting on all of them."
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   Which effectively meant they're buying and selling
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.720]   the same index funds to optimize their taxes,
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.840]   but three people completely uncoordinated are doing it.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.640]   And the end result is just not going to be fun.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.440]   So I always say if you are doing
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.120]   any kind of tax loss harvesting,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.200]   make sure that whoever's doing it
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.840]   knows all the rules across all the accounts.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.200]   Otherwise, it can be messy.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.440]   Even just the investing of it.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.040]   If you are investing regularly in your IRA, like you said,
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.240]   if you're buying the same thing,
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.400]   your tax loss harvesting somewhere else can be a problem.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.160]   The single feature that I thought was the coolest
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.640]   is in Wealthfront, you can go in and put an email address
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.080]   and they have to confirm, I think.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.920]   But so my wife and I each have an account.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.840]   If we put our email addresses in Wealthfront,
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.480]   we'll link them up and tax loss harvest
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.880]   accordingly across all the accounts.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.560]   So there's software that could do it.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.000]   There are advisors that could do it.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.040]   You could do it once a year
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.560]   where you know everything's happening.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   But if you're trying to play the tax games,
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.560]   I'm with you that you just got to be careful
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.840]   because the tax games all go away if you mess it up.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.760]   Yeah. Especially if you're tax loss harvesting,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.960]   I'd recommend do not automatically reinvest your dividends.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.320]   That's also another nightmare
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.080]   because you could sell out of a position
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.960]   and then it automatically reinvest and starts to wash.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.080]   That's another wash sale thing
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.840]   where you now don't get the tax loss at all.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.600]   So you got to be really careful.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.080]   We could do a whole episode just on that
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.520]   because I've made all the mistakes now
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.280]   and I know all the things to look out for.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.440]   But it's just it's so complex that I agree.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.800]   You need like one person in the so-called driver's seat
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.720]   trying to figure out all the accounts and everything.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.800]   Otherwise, you're going to wash sale yourself.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.160]   It's not a matter of if, but when.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.120]   You got to be really careful.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.640]   So yeah.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.880]   Or like you said, a hack there would be
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.720]   just have a different set of funds.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.440]   If you are investing in 2 different accounts
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.360]   and you don't want to have to deal with that,
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.520]   just pick a different set of index funds in each account.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   So you're not at risk.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.560]   Also, all my non-taxables are identical
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.000]   because I can do whatever
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.680]   and I'm not going to get any sort of wash sale
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.800]   because they're all non-tax.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.560]   My IRAs, 401ks, etc.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.000]   But then all my brokerage stuff
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.640]   is a completely separate set of funds.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.160]   So there's no overlap there
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   because I don't want any sort of accidents
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.120]   to happen, so to speak.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.280]   We talked a lot about investing
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.840]   and a lot of the book is about saving.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.240]   And I did want to touch on one thing
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.160]   where you talk a little bit
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.760]   about how some people early on
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.760]   might be focusing too much on investing
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.240]   and when they should be focused on saving.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.200]   Why is that?
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.440]   Well, I mean, let's just do some simple math here.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.360]   It'll show, it'll illustrate it instantly, right?
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.760]   Imagine you have $1,000 to your name, right?
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   You're 22 years old like I was or 23.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.440]   I'm like, "Hey, I'm starting investing.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.760]   I spent all this time analyzing my investments and all this."
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.520]   Let's say you get a 10% return.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.120]   That's $100, right?
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.360]   At the same time, when I was 23,
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.800]   I was out in San Francisco with friends.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.600]   We'd go to dinner, have drinks, Uber home, all that.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.800]   I easily was spending $100 in a single night.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.040]   Me foregoing one night going out with my friends
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.120]   was the same as my investment return for a year.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.080]   So, you can see when you don't have a lot of capital to invest,
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.640]   especially younger people, people who are just starting.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.200]   It's not going to matter what your investments do.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.840]   That's the sad truth.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.800]   No one wants to talk about it,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.640]   but it's not really going to matter what happens.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.280]   And once you start building that nest egg, then it does.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.440]   And so, you can see generally over someone's life.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.960]   I mean, the phrase I like to use
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.240]   since the chapter one in the book
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.280]   is called "Savings for the poor and Investing for the rich."
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.440]   And I don't mean poor in an absolute way.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.040]   I mean, it could be true in an absolute way,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.480]   but I really mean in a relative way.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.560]   If you're young, you're probably poor
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.080]   relative to your future self.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.560]   You're assuming you're going to have a career, save money, etc.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.040]   You're relatively poor compared to your future self.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.600]   And so, you need to focus more on your income,
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.720]   your savings, things like that.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.840]   And as you get older,
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.280]   you can spend a lot more time on investments.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.960]   That doesn't mean you shouldn't read books on investing.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.640]   I'm not anti-knowledge. Of course not.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.800]   Of course, I want people to learn more about this stuff.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.480]   But you don't need to spend a ton of time on it,
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.360]   at least initially.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.560]   Just set something up.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.800]   "Oh, should I be in a target date? Should I do this?"
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.040]   It's not going to matter that much if you're 22 or 23.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:01.760]   It's really not.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.680]   But as you start to learn more about stuff,
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.640]   start saving up more money,
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.000]   then your investment decisions matter.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.440]   Because now let's do the flip side.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.200]   Let's say you have a $10 million portfolio,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.560]   and it declines by 10%.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.360]   That's $1 million.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.480]   Someone that could save $1 million after tax,
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.560]   you have to have a very high-paying job.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   There's very few people that can do something like that.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.960]   So you can see, once you have a big portfolio,
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.400]   investing is kind of the whole game.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.840]   Your income is not going to be able to do much to budge that,
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.800]   but your investment knowledge and what you do
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.640]   and what you own really matters a lot more.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.120]   So just think about where do you have the most leverage?
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.720]   If you want to talk about a hack,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.360]   the best hack I know is take your time and attention
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.120]   and focus on the area where you have the most leverage.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.520]   When you're 22, when you're young, it's your career.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.160]   And as you get older, and assuming you have more wealth,
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.960]   it's your investments.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.760]   And so figuring out where you are on that spectrum
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.560]   is what's important.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.920]   So the little rule I like to use is just figure out
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.360]   how much you could save in the next year.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.040]   That's some number, let's say $10,000.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.920]   Figure out how much your investments can return you
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.400]   in the next year.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.600]   Let's say in a good year, you can get a 10% return.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.200]   Let's just use that number for fun.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.840]   10% return, unless you have $50,000 invested,
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.960]   that's $5,000.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.080]   So if you could save $10,000,
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.680]   but your investments can only earn you $5,000,
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.360]   you probably need to work a little bit more on
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.920]   either raising your income or saving more money
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.520]   to get that other number higher.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.040]   You want that $50,000 to be $100,000 and then $200,000, etc.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.120]   So that if it gets a 10% return,
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.200]   that the amount of income you're gonna get is larger.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.120]   So whatever number is bigger is where you need to focus on.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.640]   Because over time, you're going to see that
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.240]   your investments are gonna be able to return you
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.320]   more than you can save in a year, in theory.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.840]   So if everything goes well.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.800]   So that's what they're focused on.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.880]   And so let's go down that journey.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.360]   Now you're at the point your investments are earning you more.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.960]   You're kind of in that second half of the journey.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.440]   And you're in a situation where I know a lot of people are,
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.600]   which is they're struggling to spend money.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   They've gone through this disciplined cycle of saving.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   And now... And maybe they're not all the way there.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.800]   Maybe they're still saving more than they would earn in their investments.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.240]   But they're struggling because they don't want to spend money.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.600]   And I know so many people that have that guilt and anxiety,
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.520]   myself, my wife included,
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.480]   where we're trying to feel comfortable spending money.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.200]   Because after all, what is all the money for
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.120]   if we're not able to actually use it on the things we want?
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.440]   But people who, I guess, adopt a diligent savings habits
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.640]   sometimes struggle here.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.720]   Yeah. So this is a problem that a lot of people have,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.880]   especially people who are affluent, who have done well.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   Because by definition, the people that have a lot of money have probably...
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.040]   Besides the people who got lucky, let's put them aside,
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.040]   have probably had pretty good savings habits, right?
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.400]   So it's like you're actually really good at acquiring money
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.760]   and you're not really good at spending.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.680]   So by definition, it's going to be difficult.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.040]   That's the first thing to realize.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.400]   It's not going to be easy for you.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.840]   I think the second thing to recognize is a lot of this comes from guilt.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.840]   Whether it's guilt, you're guilting yourself,
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.920]   or you're seeing the media guilt people,
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   or maybe your social circles would be guilting you.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.880]   I don't know what it is.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.640]   And every person is going to be different.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.880]   It's figuring out how to get past that guilt.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.280]   And I'm not saying that, "Oh, if you have a lot of money,
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.400]   you should be spending a lot of money."
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.360]   That's not my argument here.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.040]   But I'm saying you should be comfortable spending money when you need to, right?
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.480]   I don't want you to spend money frivolously.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.920]   I don't think that's good for anybody.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.160]   But if you're like, "Oh my gosh, I don't know if I should buy these
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.400]   nice dress shoes because my other ones, they're fine,
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.200]   but they're kind of getting old."
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.880]   And if you're worried about $200 purchase,
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.080]   and you're worth like 2 million bucks or 5 million bucks in net worth,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.800]   that you need to get something psychologically figured out.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.720]   Why are you feeling that way about spending money?
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.200]   And sometimes it is from stuff you can't change.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.600]   For example, I go out and spend a lot of money at restaurants.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.120]   That's the thing I like to do.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.600]   But at the same time, every time I go to McDonald's,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.200]   I still order off the dollar menu because that's what my mom and dad
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.320]   always had me order off as a kid.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.640]   And there's this weird thing where I can't get over it.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.520]   I can go drop $60 on a dried ribeye steak.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.560]   But there's something about me spending $5 on a McDonald's sandwich
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   that's going to mess with me mentally.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.000]   And so I don't know why that is.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.200]   And so you got to figure out what in my psychology is making me do that,
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.560]   and what in your psychology is making you kind of behave the way that you are.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.320]   So tips to do it.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.600]   I would say if you want to spend...
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.720]   I have a rule I use.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.760]   It's called the 2x rule.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.440]   If you're going to splurge on something,
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.040]   let's say you're going to spend $500 on some fancy watch or handbag or whatever.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.920]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.760]   Take another $500 and either invest it or donate it.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.960]   Like donate to a good cause.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.160]   Now you can get rid of your guilt saying,
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.160]   "Every time I spend on myself, I'm also donating."
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.080]   So now, yes, you're going to be spending more money,
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.000]   but at least you can kind of get rid of that guilt
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.720]   and spend it towards something that you care about in some other way.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.320]   So that's another way of doing it.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.440]   You can try and do that.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.240]   It doesn't work for everyone, but I've heard some good results from it so far.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.480]   You said you could also invest it.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.560]   So if you're investing it, you're not giving it away.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.720]   You're just kind of setting it aside for the future.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.080]   For your future self, yeah.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.840]   Can you talk a little bit about what you call the biggest lie in personal finance?
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.120]   What I think is the biggest lie in personal finance is that you can...
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.400]   That cutting spending is a reliable path to building wealth.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.360]   And I just don't think the data suggests that at all.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.040]   Like, yes, you can cut spending.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.120]   It's like a short-term workaround, but it doesn't build wealth of the long run.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.240]   I mean, just consider this.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:56.800]   Very simple.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.360]   Like, if you look at the data, like one of the most positively correlated things
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.040]   with savings rate is your income.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.480]   Like your absolute level of income.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.120]   Like people with...
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.800]   And you're gonna say, "Well, Nick, this is so obvious."
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:11.520]   Well, it's so obvious, but yet people are still pushing this cutting spending argument, right?
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.480]   It's like people with higher incomes generally save more money.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.680]   That is just across the board.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.640]   The higher rate, they're even saving a higher percentage of their income.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.600]   And the reason is simple.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.720]   Like incomes go up, but your spending doesn't move with it, right?
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.600]   It's like law of the stomach.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.800]   Like if I increase your income 10x, are you gonna spend 10 times more on food?
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.840]   Probably not, right?
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.840]   Are you gonna spend 10 times more on housing?
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.880]   Maybe, but probably not.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.240]   Maybe you'll spend 8 times more on housing.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:32.640]   I don't know.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.200]   But you see people generally earn more and more money.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.640]   They don't spend more and more.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.280]   And you're like, "But Nick, I know someone that had...
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.240]   I know this rich person.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.200]   I know this person has high income.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.760]   They spend a lot."
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.880]   Yes, you know these people.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.600]   You know a handful.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.560]   You can think of anecdotes.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.000]   I know people like that too.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.920]   But the data suggests, if you're looking across aggregate data sets across most people,
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.680]   that that is just not true.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.840]   And I'm sorry to burst the bubble, but it's just...
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.480]   It's not in there.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.320]   And if you wanna bring other data sets that show this, I'd be happy to look at them.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:04.000]   But I have not seen any data sets that show that people of higher income are spending money
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.920]   at a higher rate than people of lower income.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.440]   So, I think it really shows that really the way to get rich in the long run,
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.240]   the most reliable path, it does take longer, is to raise your income.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.000]   And find other income opportunities.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.200]   Work on your career, whatever.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.280]   Work on a side hustle that becomes a main hustle, whatever.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.800]   There's a lot of ways to do this.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.400]   But it's what I recommend.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.320]   And you break down each one of those in...
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   I can't remember which chapter in the book, right?
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.280]   Yeah. Chapter 3, I talk about different ways you can raise your income, right?
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:27.840]   Different.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.240]   If you really need that type of stuff, there's different ways of doing it.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.680]   Whether it's selling a product, whether it's selling a skill or a service,
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.920]   teaching people, there's a lot of different ways you can do this.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:40.400]   And mine is just like a limited set just to get your ideas flowing if you need that help.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.200]   But that's really the only way out as I see it.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:43.920]   Cool.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.240]   As you build more wealth, it doesn't matter.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.960]   And we've talked about this before, but you're never going to feel rich.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.800]   So I don't want to get into that paradigm because I know we've talked about it a lot.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.160]   But I am curious if you have any stories, anecdotes, or tips for people who are in
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.360]   that boat where they're like, "Gosh, I feel like I'm at a place where
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.560]   I thought when I got here, I'd be great.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.360]   And now I just feel exactly like I did 1 year, 5 year, 10 years ago."
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.640]   I think the easiest way to do it is to remember where you came from.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.000]   Think about... Have an absolute measure of wealth.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.880]   For example, if you have over $100,000 in liquid net worth,
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:25.120]   that puts you in the top 10% of people on the planet in terms of how rich you are.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.320]   I would say that's considered rich.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.680]   And you're saying, "Nick, that's ridiculous. You can't compare me to some
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.000]   random person else out there in the world." That's not fair.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.320]   But in the book, I talk about this.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.600]   Lloyd Blankfein, the ex-CEO of Goldman Sachs, was interviewed about this.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.880]   They asked him just about his life.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.480]   And he's like, "I don't feel rich. I'm well-to-do."
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.280]   Even though he's a billionaire.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   This person's a billionaire. He says, "I'm not rich. I'm well-to-do."
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.200]   And you're saying like, "That's a ridiculous argument.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.680]   How can you say, Lloyd Blankfein, that you're not rich?"
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.880]   Well, because he's hanging out with people like David Geffen and Jeff Bezos,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.880]   and people who have 10, 100x his wealth.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.640]   So he doesn't feel rich relative to them.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.720]   Well, I can make the same argument that like, "Hey."
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.160]   I know what he's saying is outlandish.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.440]   But what you're saying about how like, "Oh, well, you can't compare me to those
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.480]   other people around the world."
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.200]   It's the same thing.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.880]   Lloyd Blankfein doesn't think that you can compare him to people like you and me.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.320]   Because he's like, "That's not my social circle. Those aren't my people."
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.480]   So you're making the same argument he's making.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.800]   Obviously, it's less objectively outrageous.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.000]   But it's the same argument.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   So I think you have to look at global wealth.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.960]   You have to look at absolute thing relative to your history.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.760]   What you could expect to earn or expect to have in your life.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.840]   I think that's the only way to stay grateful and
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   to kind of break out of that cycle of not feeling rich.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.640]   Like, for example, I consider myself rich despite...
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.440]   I'm not a millionaire.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.800]   Like, objectively, in the United States, I'm not rich.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.360]   But like, relative to the world, I consider myself rich.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.120]   And so I have to think like that.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.600]   Otherwise, I will always be chasing that type of stuff.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.640]   And so I think you have to kind of remember that and kind of have some...
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.680]   That's how you ground yourself.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.240]   So I consider...
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.240]   I would consider myself a rich person, despite the fact that I'm not even a millionaire.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.360]   I'm not someone who can go around and fly private or any of that type of stuff,
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.080]   which we would really...
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.760]   Which we would consider rich behavior.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.960]   I think it's just a way of looking at the world so that I don't kind of lose myself
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.240]   to that type of stuff.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.760]   Taking out of your mind that flying private is rich behavior.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.400]   It's probably going to help because I feel like most of us will probably never get to that point.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.560]   We did have an episode where we talked about how you might be able to do it for a little bit less.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.160]   But no matter how you slice it, it's just really expensive.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.640]   So don't put that as a target or a goal.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.400]   You can always use points in fly business class for way less.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.320]   So I think most people here know that.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:32.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:37.920]   You ended the book talking about this experiment where you said,
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:43.200]   "If I were able to create some principles that I would give to myself,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.000]   if I were randomly dropped somewhere in the last 100 years,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.600]   what would I create if those principles weren't like avoid the stock market
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.440]   during a certain time period or something?"
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.640]   And you said that was the book.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.480]   The idea was you wanted to write this book, I assume, for anyone at any point in time to read.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.720]   But there were 21 principles.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.480]   So I'm curious, if you had to pick only a couple, what would they be?
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.680]   We just discussed one of them.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.600]   You'll never feel rich and that's okay.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.880]   I think that's a huge principle.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.440]   And because throughout history, status is always going to be something that affects humans.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.120]   It's going to be something true today, 100 years from now, 1000 years from now.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.320]   I know that's going to be true.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.240]   I don't know what the investment environment is going to look like,
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.520]   whether we're going to have investments.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.800]   You go back a couple hundred years, investing wasn't a thing that people did,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.320]   especially regular people did.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.400]   It was something that maybe the rich did or governments did,
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.080]   but regular people wouldn't do that.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.560]   So yeah, you're never going to feel rich.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.200]   That's one thing.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.760]   If I had to guess, I assume markets on average will keep
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.000]   going up and to the right over the very long term.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.280]   There's going to be human growth.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.640]   I think capitalism will survive despite all the critiques against it.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.000]   Which means if that's true, then buy quickly, sell slowly.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.640]   That is a kind of an idea I had for thinking about how to invest in markets.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.200]   Don't wait.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.240]   Don't sit in cash forever trying to wait and trying to find the right time,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.200]   those market timing things.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.960]   So that's kind of like an overarching point of my work.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.480]   That's another big one I'd put out there.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.440]   I think another one which people don't discuss enough...
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.120]   I know there's a lot of money things we can talk about,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.680]   but I think a lot of the things that affect people is more about their life.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.360]   So that's why I talk about not feeling rich.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.920]   But in addition, before...
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.280]   Figure out not where you're going to retire from, but where you're going to retire to.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.200]   That's what's really important in retirement.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.520]   A lot of people think retirement is about money and all this.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.360]   And don't get me wrong, money is a piece of it.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.040]   But I think the existential crisis of retirement is a far bigger thing
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.400]   that people do not talk about.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.800]   And it's literally a big life change.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.440]   You go from going into an office every day or talking with people,
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.680]   whatever you're doing, to now you don't do that anymore.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.120]   You have to fill that entire 40-hour week with other things.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.720]   And I think a lot of people aren't ready for that.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.800]   And it really hits them in a bad way.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.360]   So before you figure out what you're going to retire from,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.800]   figure out what you're going to retire to.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.240]   Really imagine your retirement.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.960]   Figure out what type of activities you're going to do, with who, how often, etc.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.880]   Is that going to be with family, with friends, whatever?
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.840]   I think a lot of that...
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.440]   We should put a lot more emphasis on that,
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.960]   because I think that's going to have a bigger impact on people's well-being
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.080]   than whether they can use the 4% rule or the 3% rule.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.840]   I don't think money is the primary concern for most people in retirement.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.760]   And I think my book has illustrated that.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.720]   If you read chapter 2, it talks about that at length.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.280]   So if I had to give a couple principles, the market timing one,
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   because it's kind of my bread and butter what I talk about.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.560]   I'd say the feeling rich thing,
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.640]   because I think a lot of people don't focus on that.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   And then same with the retirement thing.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.920]   Thinking about much...
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.600]   Think beyond money when it comes to retirement.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.040]   Those are the 3 big ones I'd give out.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.240]   I know that from our conversation outside of this interview,
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.480]   you have some life hacks, some tricks, some tactics, some routines
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.920]   that are worth sharing that have nothing to do with personal finance or investing.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:45.840]   So I'm curious, while we have you, what some of your top ones are.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.040]   If you live in a city where they have laundry services,
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.440]   I recommend getting your laundry done.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.320]   Just taking it in there or have them pick up, deliver.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.360]   I think it's one of the biggest...
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.800]   I actually have a friend who lives in Long Island.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.600]   So he actually doesn't... He has to drive it in and stuff.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.920]   And he's like, "It's the greatest thing I've ever done."
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.200]   It's because it saves you time and it's so low cost relative to your time.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.320]   I hate folding clothes.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   It's one of the best things I've ever done.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.920]   I feel like every time I spend my money there,
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.360]   I'm getting a bargain relative to doing my laundry by hand.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.360]   And especially if you have a wife and kids or whatever,
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.600]   or husband and children, whatever it is, that's a ton of clothing.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.720]   You have to physically wash it, dry it, sort it out, fold it.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.840]   It's just so much time and mental energy that especially if you're really busy,
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.800]   having someone else just do that and getting it delivered all full,
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.920]   and you just got to put it in a drawer is so much easier.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.720]   That's my first hack.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.040]   Have someone else do your laundry if you can,
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.080]   if there's an area where you can find that where they have laundry services.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.320]   I think it's probably one of the most undervalued things out there.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.080]   That's one.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.320]   Another thing, this is a travel hack I use.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.080]   I have duplicates of almost...
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.880]   Like, "Oh, I have to pack a toothbrush. I have to pack this. I have to pack..."
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.000]   Nope. I have everything already sitting in my suitcase ready to go.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.840]   The only thing I have to still pack is clothing because weather does change.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.920]   If I'm in Seattle, it's very different than I'm in Phoenix,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.000]   especially if I'm different in Boston when I'm going.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.920]   So I do have to pack clothing,
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.440]   but everything else I have and I need on a trip is already in my suitcases.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   I never say, "Oh, did I forget my toothbrush?"
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.120]   0% chance because it's already in there.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.360]   On top of that, if you do, something happens.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.200]   Let's say your razor runs out of...
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.320]   The blades go bad or something.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:16.880]   You need a...
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.840]   "I don't have a backup razor."
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.440]   Yeah, you do. It's in your travel bag, right?
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.200]   So you already have... It's like redundancy.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.080]   I think thinking more about redundancy is really important
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.920]   because it just reduces your risk of like,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.920]   "I used to forget. Oh, God. I forgot my razor.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.240]   Oh, I forgot my deodorant. I forgot this or that."
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.920]   Never. I've never forgotten a thing since.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.040]   So pack, double pack.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.320]   You're saying, "I have to buy everything twice."
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.720]   I'm telling you it's worth the cost to do it once
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.320]   and you'll never have to think about it again.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.800]   So if I could, I would actually have a whole wardrobe ready to pack.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.240]   But that's really hard to do
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.440]   and you're not gonna know where you're gonna go.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.320]   So you can't do that.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.400]   But I would say just have backups and travel.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.640]   That's my other big hack I give out there.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.480]   There's a company and I can't remember the name.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.400]   And if I find it, I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:56.080]   But that actually does this as a service where you send them clothes
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.280]   and you send them your dopp kit and everything with your toiletries
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   and a suitcase.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.720]   And then they inventory it online.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.240]   And you're like, "I need this stuff. Ship my suitcase there."
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.280]   And you just show up and they ship you a suitcase with whatever clothes.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.160]   You send it back.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.920]   They wash the clothes and they put them back.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.040]   This is the perfect hack.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   It's a combo of your two hacks.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.440]   There's a company out there that will do all this for you.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.160]   So you just have to buy a second wardrobe.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.840]   But I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.240]   I remember looking at it and thinking, "This was an awesome service,
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.200]   but it's too expensive."
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:29.840]   Yeah. And it depends how diversified your wardrobe is.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.600]   I wear black neck t-shirts, most v-neck t-shirts a lot of the times.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.800]   I could easily do that.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.880]   I know there's a lot of people that would be like, "Oh, heck no."
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:41.040]   If my girlfriend had worn different dresses or something, there's no way.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.480]   It would be really tough to do that.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.120]   But I think I can see how it could work though. It's interesting.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.120]   Awesome. Okay. I have one more hack.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.200]   I know you didn't ask for this. I'm just going to throw it out there.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.120]   The biggest hack I've ever done in my life,
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.720]   maybe the greatest decision of my life.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   So I applied to a very selective school.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.160]   I got into Stanford.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.240]   But at the time when I was applying,
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.000]   I eventually did all this analysis after the time.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.600]   I didn't realize this. I applied early.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.240]   So I'd apply early where if I got in early, I basically had to go.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.760]   And so I couldn't apply anywhere else early.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.520]   But I was looking at the statistics and the acceptance rate my year
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.760]   to get into Stanford was 10%. Very difficult.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.760]   But early acceptance was 18%. It was double.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.520]   Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying 10% is very hard.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.760]   18% is still hard, but it's not as hard.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.960]   Today, those rates are half of that.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.920]   If you want to get your kid into like a selective school,
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.440]   and there's like some sort of early program,
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.680]   I guarantee you the acceptance rate is higher.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.360]   And there's no single thing you can do to double your kid's chances
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.560]   of getting to a selective university than by having them apply early.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.280]   I don't care if they got a 2400. I don't care if they're valedictorian.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.720]   I don't care. You can go across the board.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.280]   There's not one single thing that's going to double their chances,
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.440]   but that's a hack that probably will.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   I bet if you look at the data now, it's still double.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.800]   I think the last time I checked,
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.960]   like now the standard acceptance rate is like 5%.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.480]   But if you apply early, it's 10.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.280]   So it's like, I mean, it's like an arm.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.400]   It's like the easiest arm out there.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.320]   Of course, you can probably only do this to one school.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.880]   But if you have like one of these schools, you're like, "Hey, I want to go there."
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.480]   Parents are spending all this money on all this stuff.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.840]   It's like, have them apply early.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.960]   That literally doubles their chance.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.360]   It makes no sense to me why this isn't being talked about more.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   I wish I should have seen a bunch of articles on this.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.320]   I have not seen it yet.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.080]   So that's my biggest life hack for trying to get your kids into a selective school.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:20.960]   So I hope that helps.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:26.240]   I hope it holds true a decade or two from now when my kids are actually going to school.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.440]   Everyone's short in college now.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.720]   So who knows, right?
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.480]   Well, one more thing I always like to end on is to pick a city you love
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.920]   and just give some people some suggestions who are visiting from out of town.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.840]   Places to eat, something to drink, something to do, anything in there.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.520]   Yeah. So I'll give you some New York City stuff.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.240]   I'm a big foodie.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.280]   So I'm going to focus on that.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.720]   You can look up what's in New York City museums, etc.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.640]   I say find your interest and go after that.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.640]   So big thing, food places, it really depends what you want exactly.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.560]   But I recommend one of the biggest brands in New York City is called Quality.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.920]   So Quality Eats, Quality Meats, Quality Bistro, Quality Italian.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.760]   There's a bunch of different restaurants here.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.160]   It's not like a chain like that, but it's like a restaurant group.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.600]   I think they have really good food.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.760]   It's more high-end, really fun.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.480]   If you like sushi, Sushi Seki is good.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:15.840]   If you want to do a Michelin star restaurant, my favorite is probably Momofuku Ko in the city.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.280]   If you look that one up, Ko, KO, that's really awesome.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.240]   But really, honestly, if you just have restaurant recommendations,
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.200]   just DM me on Twitter.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.000]   I'll just give them to you.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.600]   Just tell me what you're looking for price range.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.240]   I'll just help you.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:26.800]   I really don't care.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:27.760]   I love doing this for people.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.920]   It's just so awesome because I've been in the city a while.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:35.600]   In terms of bars, if you want just my favorite cocktail bar, it's a place called Olly,
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.360]   just for the taste of the drinks.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.480]   O-L-L-I-E.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.120]   It's just...
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.160]   They are just so good.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.320]   It's not like the flashiest place.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.480]   It's in West Village, like in Manhattan.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.600]   Not the flashiest place here, but the drinks are just incredible.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.320]   If you want something that's more visually appealing and fun,
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.600]   there's a place called Time Bar.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.040]   There's experiences you can get.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.640]   It's like a seeded tasting type of thing.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.480]   T-H-Y-M-E.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.240]   So time, like the seasoning.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.600]   That's a really cool place.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.800]   And they have crazy...
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.160]   You'll be drinking out of what looks like an oyster shell.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:04.640]   It's not...
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.520]   It's just a copper.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.160]   It's porcelain.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.400]   But it looks like an oyster shell and all these different things.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.080]   You'll go smoke coming out of things.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.080]   You have things and drinks hanging from the roof.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:12.800]   You have to drink out.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.320]   Just really weird stuff.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.080]   So if you want to experience, that's probably a place I'd recommend.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.040]   That's awesome.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.800]   Where else can people find you in the book?
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.560]   So you can find me at my websites of dollarsanddata.com.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.480]   I said Twitter @dollarsanddata.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   Book's going to be at Amazon, Barnes & Noble.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.760]   Just search "Just Keep Buying".
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.560]   You can find it there.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.320]   So hope you guys enjoy it if you read it.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.160]   The book's fantastic.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.960]   I read it.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.640]   I love that half of the title...
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.920]   Half of the subtitles for every chapter is something contrarian to pull you in.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.240]   Because I'm like, "Whoa, I don't know if I buy that."
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.120]   And then I kept reading.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.880]   So thank you for writing that.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.240]   And thank you for being here.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.040]   Yeah. Appreciate it, Chris.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.760]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:59:48.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   [Music]
