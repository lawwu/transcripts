[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.140]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.340]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.240]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.080]   Today marks the third episode in our four episode series
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.860]   about mental health with Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.740]   Today's episode deals with the topic
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.500]   of healthy relationships,
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.800]   how to define what a healthy relationship is
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.480]   and how to achieve healthy relationships of all kinds,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.280]   including romantic relationships,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.160]   interpersonal relationships at work,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.440]   friendships with family, and of course, with oneself.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.960]   This episode builds on the framework
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.120]   of the psychology of self and mental health
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.480]   that was established in the first
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.100]   and second episodes of this series.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.400]   However, even if you didn't listen
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.760]   to the first or second episode in this series,
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.440]   today's episode will still contain
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.000]   a lot of information and protocols
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.200]   that you will find valuable
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.840]   for improving your relationships.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.520]   That said, if you have the opportunity
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.120]   to listen to the first and second episodes in this series,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.440]   I think you'll find those to be tremendously beneficial
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.340]   at any point.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520]   During today's episode, Dr. Conte discusses
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.680]   what makes for a successful relationship of any kind,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.000]   as well as tools to improve those relationships.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.720]   He discusses various types of bonds,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.020]   including healthy bonds and trauma bonds,
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.440]   not just in the context of romantic relationship,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.840]   but in the context of all types of relationships.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.380]   We also discuss different challenges
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.660]   that people face in relationships,
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.600]   including abusive relationships.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.680]   And we discuss the role of power dynamics,
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340]   anxiety, and boundaries in relationships,
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.980]   both from the perspective of unhealthy relationships,
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.780]   but more importantly, from the understanding and protocols
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.800]   to cultivate healthy relationships.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.580]   While there is an abundance of opinions
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.820]   and information out there on the internet these days
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.560]   about relationships, both healthy and unhealthy,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.280]   today's discussion approaches the topic of relationships
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.080]   through an entirely different lens,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.180]   which is the lens of the self
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.240]   in terms of one's conscious and subconscious mind,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.420]   and how multiple conscious and subconscious minds
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.120]   through different individuals interact with one another
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.740]   in ways that we can see and ways that we can't see,
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.200]   and all of that framed within the actionable steps
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.680]   that any of us can take to improve our relationship
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.520]   to ourself and to others.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.140]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.800]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.440]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.020]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.120]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.880]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.960]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.800]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.180]   with a licensed therapist carried out all online.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.900]   I've been doing therapy for more than 30 years,
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.740]   and while I confess that initially
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.080]   I was forced to do that therapy as a condition
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.780]   for being let back into high school,
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.880]   over time I learned that therapy
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.540]   is a tremendously valuable practice.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.260]   In fact, I consider doing regular weekly therapy
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.420]   as just as important as doing regular physical exercise
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.100]   in order to improve one's health.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.600]   The beauty of BetterHelp is that it makes it extremely easy
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.020]   to find a therapist that's excellent for you,
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.680]   and we can define an excellent therapist
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.020]   as somebody who's going to give you a lot of support,
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.660]   but in an objective way,
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.520]   as well as somebody with whom you can have excellent rapport
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.540]   and that can help you arrive
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.880]   at positively transformative insights
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.540]   that you wouldn't have otherwise had.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540]   And with BetterHelp, they make it convenient
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.060]   so that it's matched to your schedule
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.620]   and the other aspects of your life.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.100]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.560]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.680]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.440]   Again, that's BetterHelp, H-E-L-P.com/huberman.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.480]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.020]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.560]   that offers dozens of guided meditation sessions,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.080]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.040]   By now, there's an abundance of data showing
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.800]   that even short daily meditations
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.880]   can greatly improve our mood, reduce anxiety,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.380]   improve our ability to focus, and can improve our memory.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.780]   And while there are many different forms of meditation,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.300]   most people find it difficult
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.460]   to find and stick to a meditation practice
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.020]   in a way that is most beneficial for them.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.060]   The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.660]   to learn how to meditate
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.380]   and to carry out your daily meditation practice
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.300]   in a way that's going to be most effective
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.940]   and efficient for you.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.300]   It includes a variety of different types of meditations
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.500]   of different duration, as well as things like yoga nidra,
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.700]   which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.820]   that allows you to emerge
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.760]   feeling incredibly mentally refreshed.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.420]   In fact, the science around yoga nidra is really impressive,
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.700]   showing that after a yoga nidra session,
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.060]   levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.740]   are enhanced by up to 60%,
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.000]   which places the brain and body
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.140]   into a state of enhanced readiness
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.600]   for mental work and for physical work.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.660]   Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.280]   is that it provides a 30-day introduction course.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.880]   So for those of you that have not meditated before
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.380]   or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.420]   Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.780]   and regular meditator,
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.720]   Waking Up has more advanced meditations
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.820]   and yoga nidra sessions for you as well.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.680]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.380]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.920]   and access a free 30-day trial.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.980]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.020]   And now for my discussion about mental health
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.000]   with Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.500]   Dr. Conte, welcome back.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.700]   - Thank you, happy to be here.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.300]   - Today, we're going to discuss relationships,
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.740]   and that will often focus on romantic relationships,
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.800]   but also relationships between friends,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.580]   between family members,
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.140]   and inevitably the relationship to self,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.680]   which is what we really focused on
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.960]   in episodes one and two of this series.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.300]   Episode one being all the things
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.620]   that go into a healthy self
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.380]   and how to understand what is unhealthy and healthy
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.540]   in all of us and make adjustments
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.120]   to the unhealthy aspects of our unconscious and conscious
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.940]   through really specific proactive behaviors
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.000]   and patterns of thought.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.300]   So really a roadmap to these ideals
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.540]   that we call mental health and understanding of the self.
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.140]   Today, we want to talk about relationships
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.660]   from the perspective of, of course, how people relate,
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.900]   but I have a feeling it's going to have
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   something to do with,
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.540]   or perhaps almost everything to do with
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.380]   our relationship to understanding ourselves first.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.200]   - Yes.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.320]   - So just to make sure that we're all on the same page,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.260]   regardless of whether or not
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.580]   people have seen episodes one and two,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.380]   and certainly people do not need to have seen
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.900]   or listened to episodes one and two of this series
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.740]   in order to understand today's discussion.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.560]   Could you please tell us what is a healthy person
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.580]   and how can we ask ourselves the sorts of questions
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.440]   that allow us to determine whether or not we are healthy
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.980]   and where to look in terms of making adjustments
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.780]   if we want to be healthier than we already are,
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.100]   which I have to believe almost everybody,
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.900]   if not everybody certainly wants to be the healthiest
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.480]   and best expression of themselves
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.240]   so that they can do the most for themselves
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.460]   and for others in the world.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.540]   - So the linchpin of it all, right,
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.300]   is the agency and gratitude as verbs, right?
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.880]   That's the top of the mountain, right?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.860]   There's a lot of climbing we do
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.280]   to get to the top of the mountain.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.100]   Once we're over the top of the mountain,
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.420]   then things are in a better place.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.260]   And even though there are two words, right,
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.460]   agency is of course a word, gratitude is a word,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.100]   but it doesn't mean that they're separate concepts.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.760]   Approaching the world through the lens of agency
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.380]   and gratitude, thought of as one thing
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.100]   because they come together and they come together as verbs.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.740]   That's what we're aiming for, right?
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.740]   Because that's the thing that we can work towards, right?
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.700]   If you think about what comes underneath of that, right?
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.700]   It takes us back to the two pillars and the 10 cupboards,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.260]   right, and if we're looking in there enough,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.420]   we're minding, like what is in my unconscious mind
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.060]   I might not be aware of?
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.200]   Let me generate some curiosity about my defense mechanisms
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.100]   and my character structure and think about what's salient
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.940]   inside of me.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.860]   Like if we're doing all of that, then what we're doing,
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.480]   we're building empowerment, we're building humility,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.540]   and then ultimately the expression of all of that
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.620]   is the agency and gratitude.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.420]   And it's something that we can't have enough of.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.660]   Like I said, what's the best amount of that?
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.820]   The most that's possible, right?
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.500]   Because we're going to engage in the world
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.040]   in the healthiest way because agency and gratitude,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.640]   it doesn't mean like we're happy about everything, right?
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.060]   If there's something negative and we can change that,
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.540]   then we don't feel happy about that.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.060]   The sense of gratitude in me makes me more likely
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.100]   to feel that I can change that, right?
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.780]   Or to take the chance of trying to change that.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.180]   And then the agency part of that concept
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.740]   can come more to the fore and I can make the change.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.140]   So it's not about bliss, right?
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.660]   It's not about forgiving self and others
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.300]   for all sorts of things and not working to make better.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.460]   It's about being in the world and being as aware
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.340]   as I can possibly be, including being aware
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.280]   that there are things I'm not aware of, right?
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.740]   So sort of having a healthy respect
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.660]   and an orientation to the world that values truth
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.200]   and values understanding and exploration.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.540]   If we do all of that, then we reach the top of the mountain
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.400]   through the agency and gratitude.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   And then what builds upon that or what comes from that
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.760]   is the peace, the contentment, the delight,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.820]   the generative drive being strengthened.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.100]   Like that all comes together.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.620]   And then the aggressive, or we say aggressive
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.820]   'cause that's a traditional term,
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.580]   but the aggressive or the assertive, right?
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.780]   The assertiveness or assertion drive.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.580]   However, whatever word we wanna put to that,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.300]   that drive exists in us in a way that subserves
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.600]   the generative drive.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.720]   The same thing with the pleasure drive in us.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.300]   It exists in us, but it's observing the generative drive.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.700]   And then all those good things come together
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.420]   and they come together to help us be as healthy as we can
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.140]   and to stay healthy, right?
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.460]   Including when tribulation or difficulties come our way
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.220]   so that we stay as best we can
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.100]   in the agency and gratitude as verbs.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.940]   And again, there's nothing theoretical about this.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.580]   Like it's a way to live.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.740]   And there are a lot of people who live some of their lives
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.940]   or parts of their lives through that, right?
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.460]   And we can aspire to it and we can work towards it.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.380]   And if we're the best that we can be,
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.620]   then we're gonna be in our relationships
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.620]   the best we can be.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.780]   Like think about it, like you and I have a relationship.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.720]   We know each other, we're working together.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.380]   If I can bring my best self to you,
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.860]   to thinking about you, to understanding you,
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.580]   if I can bring the agency and the gratitude,
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.660]   then I'm gonna do right by you.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.320]   I'm gonna mentalize this idea of thinking about
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.540]   what's going on inside of you.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.780]   Like I'm gonna bring the best of all of that.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.140]   And then because we have a relationship,
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.420]   there's also an us.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.340]   Like there's a me, there's a you,
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.140]   there's something that happens between us.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.420]   That's the relationship, that's the us.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.780]   And I will also bring my best self to that thing
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.740]   that is no longer just me or just you, but that isn't us.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.800]   And that applies to all relationships, right?
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.540]   You can apply that to seeking health
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.580]   in every single relationship in our lives.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.460]   - What you're saying really speaks to the importance
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.420]   of people taking a real look at themselves,
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.740]   which is not necessarily an inventory of self
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.500]   in the typical sense that we're used to hearing it,
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.060]   but rather through this lens or map of the self
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.100]   that was spelled out in episodes one and two.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.960]   And again, for those that are just joining the series now,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.140]   the map as we're referring to it is available
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.620]   as a downloadable PDF in the show note captions.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.620]   People wanna get that, it's completely zero cost.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.900]   You can just go there and access it
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.520]   or just view it on a screen, print it out,
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.400]   whatever you like.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.720]   You certainly don't need to do that
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.900]   because here again, we're talking about the core elements
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.840]   of that map, which if I understand correctly,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.620]   arrive eventually at a set of verb states
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.780]   that we're calling agency and gratitude.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.140]   Those are not separate, as you pointed out.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.900]   They work together.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.780]   - You described it as on top of the geyser, right?
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.340]   And I really like that.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.340]   Like there's a lot of things going on,
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.300]   but then it all uplifts to something, right?
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.860]   And if we're doing it in the right way,
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.700]   in the diligent way, then it is like a geyser.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.860]   And what it's lifting up on top of it
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.420]   is the agency and gratitude.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.140]   I love, you put those words to it
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.480]   and I think it captures it really profoundly.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.740]   - Well, the stuff that geysers up perhaps
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.220]   deserves a bit of our attention just for a few moments.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.460]   You described these two pillars that I described
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.140]   as geysering up to agency and gratitude
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.660]   in the best circumstances.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.260]   But the best circumstances we wanna remind ourselves
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.060]   and everybody are attainable by looking at
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.340]   what's in those pillars.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.100]   Those two pillars are the structure of self.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.380]   So really understanding something
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.980]   about the structure of self.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.020]   So that includes some understanding
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.340]   of the unconscious mind,
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.740]   some understanding of the conscious mind,
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.200]   defense mechanisms, character structure, and self.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.700]   That was all reviewed and described in episodes one and two.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.060]   As well as the functions of self,
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.780]   which are more of the verb states,
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.940]   the expressions of the structure of self.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.620]   Self-awareness being the first of those.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.420]   Defense mechanisms in action.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.400]   And here I'd be remiss if I didn't tell myself
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.340]   and everybody else again,
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.540]   that defense mechanisms are not always bad.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.540]   There can be healthy defense mechanisms.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.380]   They can protect us in very valuable ways.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.580]   And then this notion of salience,
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.060]   what we pay attention to.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.020]   What sorts of scripts are going on in our head
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.140]   about ourselves and others?
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.280]   What are we paying attention to?
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.260]   How are we interpreting those in our head and to others?
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.500]   And then most importantly, perhaps to ourselves.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.940]   And then our actual behaviors of what are we doing
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.900]   from the time we wake up
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.420]   until the time we go to sleep at night.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.520]   And then our strivings, our sense of hopefulness,
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.540]   or perhaps lack of strivings.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.180]   And there I am reminded also that
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.600]   nobody does all of these things perfectly all the time.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.540]   We all have elements within us that perhaps are not
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.460]   serving to geyser up into agency and gratitude
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.280]   as well as they could.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.300]   But that all of us have the capacity to look
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.940]   at these two pillars and these 10 things
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.180]   that were just listed off as you described them as
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.100]   cupboards that we look into and examine and think about.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.680]   And that if we can do that with a skilled clinician
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.740]   like yourself or another psychiatrist or psychologist,
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.560]   terrific, but even if we don't have access to that,
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.040]   that we can examine within us what is and is not serving
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.460]   to geyser up into agency and gratitude.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.300]   - We can bring any issue of self to those two pillars
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.140]   and the 10 cupboards within them.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.460]   Any issue of self, why?
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.380]   Because that's what it is, right?
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.260]   In the sense that like it is the us, what's inside of me.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.340]   I have an unconscious mind, I have a conscious mind,
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.620]   I have a defensive structure, I have a character structure,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.780]   I have a self, right?
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.800]   Like that's what it is, right?
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.780]   And all the functions that you mentioned,
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.020]   they're all going on within that structure of self.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.420]   They're manifesting themselves.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.600]   Like that's what it is when we're being, right?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.680]   In the active way of the verb being, right?
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.520]   That's what it is,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.200]   which is why we can bring to it any issue of self,
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.360]   even though of course there's tremendous complexity there.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.960]   The million things that go on in a second,
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.940]   underneath the surface in the unconscious mind
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.520]   and our defensive structures and how to see them.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.980]   But we're human beings, we're complicated, right?
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.660]   Like that's okay because we have methods of understanding,
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.340]   we have methods of inquiry and we can use those methods
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.140]   to make things better.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.240]   And that's how we make the geyser as strong as it can be.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.680]   Where like maybe some of the water's running counter-current
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.520]   in the okay, well let's try and have things
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.580]   go all in the same direction,
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.840]   but we don't need things to be perfect
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   for the geyser to spring up and the agency and gratitude
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.180]   to then be uplifted upon it.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.200]   - So everybody has one of these maps as I understand it.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.520]   And therefore, anytime we're talking about relationships,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.860]   romantic relationships or otherwise,
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.080]   we're talking about the intersection
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.460]   or overlap of those maps in some way.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.100]   Maybe even the synergy and the outgrowth of those maps
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.160]   becomes its own map.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.760]   I think we'll get to this a little bit later.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.600]   - Yes.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.240]   - When I and most people hear the word relationships
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.620]   in particular romantic relationships,
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.180]   I make a couple of automatic assumptions.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.860]   First of all, I have to assume that people
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.400]   are either in a relationship or out of a relationship.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.560]   There's probably a third category out there
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.840]   of plurals and other things,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.640]   but we'll keep it relatively simple.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.960]   And most people, I assume, when they search for
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.880]   or enter or entered a relationship,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.500]   they thought about whether or not they had resonance
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.080]   with the person, whether or not there was a intellectual
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.480]   or mutual interest resonance or a physical resonance.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.400]   Maybe something about family history, common goals, et cetera.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.820]   That's typically what people think about.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.840]   And then perhaps if people have a bit more
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.320]   of a psychological understanding
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.040]   or they're reading some pop psychology books these days,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.380]   some of which are pretty good,
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.200]   they might understand something about themselves
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.920]   or the other person being a bit more anxious
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.840]   or a bit more relaxed.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   So you'll hear things like anxious attached,
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.440]   secure attached, things of that sort.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.840]   If we could just step back from all of that for a moment
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   and examine it through the lens of the maps
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.960]   as you're describing them, which exist in all of us
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.920]   and that really are the map
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.040]   to being the best version of ourselves.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.080]   If we look at relationships in terms of lists
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.280]   of where people went to school, if they went to school,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.960]   are their parents married or divorced?
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.600]   Do they have trauma that they're aware of or not aware of?
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.160]   These kinds of things.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.800]   I guess we could call those,
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.280]   and here I'm borrowing language that you used earlier
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.320]   off camera, so I want to acknowledge that.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.780]   Points of compatibility.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.160]   I think that seems like a reasonable place to start.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.520]   Do people want the same thing?
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.160]   So if you could, could you talk a little bit
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.480]   about points of compatibility in relationship
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.520]   and how those show up for better or for worse
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.600]   when you encounter people in the clinical setting?
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   When you see somebody who's in a relationship
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.200]   that's really working for them and is healthy
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.380]   versus if they're in a relationship
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.280]   where it's really unhealthy?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.040]   Presumably there's some knowledge
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.280]   about points of compatibility,
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.680]   but I'm guessing that it's not always intuitive.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.400]   I think the place we start there
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.240]   is acknowledging what we can know and what we can't know.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.760]   So this idea that there are levels of emergence
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.100]   where things at a lower level come together
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.120]   and create something that's new.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.420]   We see this throughout science from subatomic particles
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.240]   all the way through to culture, right?
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.880]   So someone could know theoretically,
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.080]   like lots and lots and lots about you
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.500]   and lots and lots and lots about me,
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.060]   but they don't know about us, right?
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.460]   Like they don't know how we interact.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.000]   They don't know if we have shared interests,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.360]   what we talk about, right?
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.560]   They don't know that, no one knows that.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.340]   Like we don't know that about the combination of people.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.240]   We can't know it in advance,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.040]   but we often believe that we can,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.540]   which then leads to a lot of false metrics
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.340]   of trying to figure things out.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.840]   So when we're looking for compatibility,
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.300]   the thought of these very basic, tangible things,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.020]   like in romance, for example,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.320]   if there's someone who absolutely wants to have a family
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.540]   and there's someone who absolutely
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.060]   does not want to have a family,
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.320]   okay, that would be a reason for those two people
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.140]   to not choose one another, right?
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.820]   So there are these factors,
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.200]   but the factors are all in a sense very evident
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.040]   and very concrete, right?
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.620]   If we go beyond that,
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.900]   we say, okay, we can see the obvious, right?
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.700]   Then what we're looking for
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.220]   is really a compatibility of generative drives, right?
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.700]   And then that, it tells you,
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.780]   can these people then get along?
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.060]   Like, you know, maybe one of them
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.320]   is from one side of the world
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.900]   and the other's from the other side of the world,
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.660]   or one's an accountant and the other is a musician.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.100]   And, you know, it doesn't mean that,
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.420]   oh, like they're built not to get along,
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.100]   or that if they're doing the same thing,
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.360]   they're built to get along,
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.660]   or if they went to college in the same place,
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.340]   or they went to college versus not going to college, right?
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.340]   There's so much there that we try to build a story on.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.940]   And then what we do is we miss the forest for the trees,
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.180]   right, and the trees, I think,
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.340]   are the factors that don't matter.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.420]   So again, let's think about the factors that do matter.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.820]   Person wants to have a family, other person doesn't.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.060]   That's relevant.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.900]   But the trees that mislead us might be,
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.340]   do they have the same level of education?
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.300]   Do they have the same family structure growing up?
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.260]   Are parents still together?
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.100]   What do they enjoy?
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.020]   Are they creative or scientific or whatever?
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.440]   Or creatively scientific, right?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.940]   We could look at all of that,
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.620]   but I think then we're making a bunch of trees
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.820]   that mislead us.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.680]   If you say, look, do these people come at the world
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.700]   through how much agency and gratitude is there guiding them?
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.560]   You know, how high is the top of that geyser?
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.380]   How high is it uplifting that?
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.340]   How strong is the generative drive?
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.820]   If we match people upon that,
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.120]   then we see, oh, those people got along
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.000]   and those people didn't.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.460]   And then there are all the other factors like pheromones,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.540]   right, and things that we can't understand
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.320]   or like reflexive first impression.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.980]   So we could let things develop,
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.260]   honoring the truth of what we can't know,
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.500]   that when you put two people together,
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.440]   you get something that's different
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.380]   than the sum of both people, right?
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.780]   It's not an overlap of maps, right?
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.020]   It's a new map, right?
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.780]   And the map is informed by things
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.140]   that are on each individual's map.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.420]   But what we're looking for are maps
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   that don't have very significant differences
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.580]   around just clear, concrete things, right?
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.560]   But once we get beyond that,
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.800]   the maps can synergize in all sorts of beautiful
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.060]   and unpredictable ways.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.820]   And if both are coming from the perspective
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.220]   of a generative drive that is at the forefront,
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.920]   great, you put those maps together and see what happens.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.040]   Maybe nothing happens.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.300]   Okay, those people don't go out on a second date.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.440]   You know, maybe something happens,
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.300]   but it doesn't develop in certain ways.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.000]   Okay, those people dated and stop dating.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.860]   Like this happens all the time, right?
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.340]   But we set the odds in our favor
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.120]   that the generative drive in each that is at the forefront
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.060]   means that their maps can synergize
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.740]   in ways that can then be beautiful
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.720]   and ways that can maybe bring to both people
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.780]   that which they want.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.180]   And I think there's a simplicity to that
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.440]   that I think if we honor it, it can be very, very helpful,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.200]   whether it's romance, it's friendships
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.320]   of looking at what the truth of it is
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.840]   instead of the factors that we try
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.820]   and gain a false sense of security
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.620]   if we're using them to select upon.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.940]   You mentioned several times the generative drive,
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.920]   and I definitely would like to learn more about that
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.340]   and spend some time there in the context of relationships.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   But just to drill a little bit further
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.860]   into what we've all heard so often,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.160]   and you touched upon a few of these themes,
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.740]   around points of compatibility,
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.260]   but also where sometimes we can respond
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.260]   to the wrong things when thinking about compatibility.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.900]   Again, we're framing this mainly in the context
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.100]   of hypothetical romantic relationships,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.680]   but certainly it pertains to other sorts of relationships.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.740]   Things like, is one person educated
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.100]   with an advanced degree and is the other person also?
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.820]   We tend to assume that people who are
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.940]   are somehow a better match than people who aren't.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.980]   It's sort of an implicit assumption
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.840]   that's often made, not always.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.380]   Or that if two people really love music,
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.460]   that they will enjoy music together
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.820]   and therefore the sum of the whole
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.900]   is greater than either of its parts.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.580]   And I think those things are utterly irrelevant.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.320]   - Interesting, and I want to hear more about this
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.020]   because I think that if you think about,
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.940]   which I'm sure you don't,
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.940]   but like dating apps, for instance,
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.020]   like what's listed out there or first or second dates,
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.580]   which consists of like learning a little bit
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.780]   about somebody and what they're doing
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.700]   and maybe even a little bit about their history
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.700]   and maybe an activity and certainly an intentional awareness
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.340]   to how the other person is behaving
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.760]   in the context of different things,
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.500]   like a waiter or a waitress
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.780]   and how they're treating people and you.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.900]   And then you hear about things like,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.100]   this is not something I'm familiar with,
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.700]   oh, right, the love languages,
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.060]   people are like, oh, what's their love languages?
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.740]   It's like gifts or like acts of physical touch
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.580]   or acts of service or something.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.460]   I met someone recently and she told me,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.020]   my love language is all of them,
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.300]   which I think is the most honest answer, right?
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.820]   Because sure, there's probably some weighting
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.740]   around what people value more or less.
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.540]   And in the absence of the things they value the most,
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.260]   it would probably feel a bit like deprivation
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.240]   in any relationship.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.420]   But as I'm describing all this,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.380]   I'm realizing more and more, yes, all of that matters,
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.940]   anxious, attached, secure, attached,
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.740]   love languages, et cetera,
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.940]   but it really doesn't get to the heart of the matter.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.160]   It really doesn't get to this, as you're describing it,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.180]   this generative drive in individuals
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.820]   and whether or not those match up well
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.620]   along the points of compatibility
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.500]   with the other person's generative drive.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.220]   And I haven't run a controlled study for this,
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.020]   but the best evidence I have is that
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.580]   there fortunately are many people out there
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.400]   who are in happy, healthy relationships,
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.500]   but there are many, many, many people who are not,
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.800]   either because they can't find them or they're in them
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.280]   and they're not healthy or they're not happy, et cetera.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.240]   So if you could elaborate a bit more on the generative drive,
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.360]   again, reminding us what the nature of that is,
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.000]   we cover this a bit in episodes one and two,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.960]   but what the nature of that is
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.660]   and some different ways that that's expressed
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.660]   and how that shows up in healthy relationship.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.680]   I think we really disprove the idea
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.840]   that some of these factors that I think are superficial
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.660]   in the context of whether people are gonna be compatible,
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.600]   they're not superficial things, but they're not germane.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.860]   So let's say you think about music, right?
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.900]   And say two people are contemplating romance, right?
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.900]   And they both really like music.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.980]   Well, that could go very, very well.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.500]   Let's say they both have a strong generative drive.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.200]   Those pillars are pretty healthy
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.460]   and the geyser of the agency and gratitude
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.980]   is riding upon it and they can find peace in themselves.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.260]   They're strongly generative.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.340]   Then they could become interested
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.940]   in the music the other person likes.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.860]   There's not gonna be a complete overlap, right?
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.660]   Even if people generally like the same thing,
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.180]   but let's say they like different things,
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.100]   like just liking music or even liking the same music,
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.880]   there's still difference, right?
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.700]   So the person has to go beyond themselves, right?
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.360]   And say, okay, I'm interested in like what you think
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.100]   even about the music we both like, right?
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.540]   What factors do you like?
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.540]   There are places of learning and of growth for both.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.660]   And you could see how both liking music,
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.260]   whether it's the same or different music,
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.140]   that sounds great, right?
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.940]   We could also see how that can not be great, right?
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.400]   If the generative drive is too low
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.940]   and the aggression drive is too high,
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.380]   then I'm gonna think I like music,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.360]   my music's better than yours, right?
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.940]   Or people then start, they'll fragment, right?
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.180]   Even though they have the same interest
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.860]   or if the pleasure drive is too high,
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.080]   then they think I wanna listen to my music, not yours.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.360]   I'm familiar with it.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.780]   Instead of, hey, I'm interested in that music
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.200]   because you're interested in it
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.040]   and I'm interested in you, right?
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.600]   Which leads us to the second part.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.440]   Let's say you have someone
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.260]   who really has no interest in music
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.720]   and someone who does.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.880]   Well, there can be an openness of saying,
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.020]   if I'm interested in this person
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.640]   and this person is really interested in music,
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.760]   well, I have some interest in it, right?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.940]   I wanna learn something about it.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.120]   I wanna experience some of it with the other person.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.580]   And let's say that person then finds,
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.880]   hey, that's not my thing, it's not the thing we connect on,
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.860]   then why would that be the end of the world, right?
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.940]   Plenty of people, one person goes to concerts,
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.180]   the other doesn't, right?
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.340]   So we try and find these points of commonality
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.180]   because I think we get over reductionist
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.320]   and then we think, oh, here's a bunch of factors
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.880]   that we will identify.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.680]   And what they do is they obscure us
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.620]   from the primary factor, which is the generative drive,
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.480]   which of course will then induce open-mindedness,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.320]   mentalization.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.100]   If I don't like music and you do,
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.120]   instead of saying, what does he like music for?
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.520]   You know, I need a friendship with somebody who likes music.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.200]   You know, you think, hey, like that's interesting.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.000]   Like if I'm interested in you as a friend
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.600]   and I have respect for you and what you think,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.880]   then why would I not have some interest
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.400]   in what you're interested in?
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.880]   You know, so this idea of compatibility
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.680]   revolves around the health in each person.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.640]   It doesn't revolve around factors
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.600]   that are anything but the concrete logistical factors
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.280]   that would just keep two people apart.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.640]   - I love the idea that healthy relationships
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.200]   center around the factors that really matter
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.680]   within the self, in particular, the generative drive.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.400]   And I love the example of someone being able to be curious
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.040]   about somebody's interests, about their partner's interests,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.000]   even though they might not share those
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.720]   from the standpoint of agency and gratitude,
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.280]   because the agency component there is really key.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.540]   I think that a lot of people feel as if
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.980]   they aren't really good at something
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.200]   or really knowledgeable about something,
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.320]   then it's not for them, right?
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.440]   Which is the opposite of having agency and gratitude,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.120]   because gratitude is closely tied to humility.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.400]   How could we know everything?
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.440]   It can be good to certain things and not others.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.040]   So the way you describe it includes aspects of openness,
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.920]   of humility, but also the agency side, the empowerment.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.320]   Like, oh, if I'm gonna learn more,
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.840]   then perhaps we could enjoy more of that together.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.920]   Perhaps not, right?
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.840]   I think this is what I'm sensing.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.960]   And I'm also sensing that the words like-minded,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   like-minded people, has so much more to do
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.560]   with their generative drives and how those match up,
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.160]   as opposed to the activities that they prefer engaging in
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.600]   and the sorts of foods they like or the movies they like.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.360]   Which makes sense at some level,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.040]   but I think it is still counterintuitive for a lot of us
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.720]   who just kind of reflexively think,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.640]   oh, like they like the same things, you know,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.420]   or maybe even they met at work
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.160]   because they like the same type of work.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.720]   They like to live in a certain area of the country
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.900]   and therefore by proximity they met.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.860]   And this raises all sorts of interesting ideas perhaps
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.800]   about the statistics of what we see, right?
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.640]   Like two musicians together,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.940]   we therefore assume that musicians belong together,
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.320]   or two scientists together.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.720]   I know loads of scientist-scientist couples
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.400]   or scientist-physician couples.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.280]   But of course the numbers are skewed
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.800]   because they were working in environments
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.360]   where it increased the probability they would interact.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.440]   So this is actually a vote for online dating.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.480]   In some sense, because it breaks through all those,
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.020]   sometimes even geographical barriers,
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.200]   but certainly the traditional barriers of culture.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.240]   - Right, right.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.440]   And if you think about,
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.880]   'cause we're talking about relationships.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.960]   So I would like my relationships
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.460]   to last as long as possible, right?
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.440]   That means now we're talking about my lifespan
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.840]   and my healthspan, right?
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.400]   Like that then becomes part of that discussion.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.780]   And of course we're very interested
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.240]   in lifespan and healthspan.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.060]   And we see people do much, much better
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.560]   when they're interconnected in the world around them,
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.340]   when they're still learning new things.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.800]   Like we know that's true,
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.660]   that people often will sort of trail off
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.080]   of what they're learning,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.120]   whether it's music, it's literature,
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.760]   it's the world around us,
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.100]   relatively early in our lifespan.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.600]   But the person who's interconnected, learning new things,
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.280]   has a much greater probability of living longer
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.240]   and living healthier, right?
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.600]   So what's that about?
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.580]   It's about a generative drive, right?
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.760]   It's about, you know what?
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.080]   I've learned a lot of things over the course of my life
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.300]   and I'm 80 years old now.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.480]   And like, great that there's more to learn, right?
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.660]   And like, that's what you see.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.800]   It makes me think of a woman who's around 90 years old
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.740]   who in my practice, she's always learning new things.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.720]   Like she's super interested in things.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   And I'm always struck about how,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   like she seems so much younger, right?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.700]   And there, that's not just a selection bias.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.920]   Like, oh, I just happen to see that in that person.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.620]   Like she has the factors that predispose to aging
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.200]   in the way that's healthiest and happiest.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.540]   So it really comes down the route of all of it
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.740]   in ourselves, in our relationships,
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.420]   in the quality of them over time
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.260]   and how long we get to have them,
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.180]   really arises from a generative drive.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.260]   And that's the thing that makes us then undefended, right?
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.380]   And lets us find interest in things about other people
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.980]   that are different from the things in us,
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.780]   which also comes about naturally.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.120]   Like, I think it's interesting that we have this sort of bias
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.240]   so that musicians belong together.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.540]   Or why they're familiar with the same things, right?
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.920]   I guess they have the same interests,
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.600]   same thing with scientists,
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.940]   but then a lot of people like different foods, right?
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.940]   Like I love different ethnic foods, like why?
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.000]   'Cause it's different, right?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.740]   It's an appreciation of difference.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.860]   I don't wanna eat just like I did growing up.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.100]   And many, many, many people are like that.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.700]   That's an appreciation of difference, of diversity.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.740]   So sometimes we'll kind of harness that
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.940]   and we'll look at it and we'll say,
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.060]   "Oh, like that's present in us."
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.580]   But for whatever reason,
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.360]   we become very reductionist about relationships.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.580]   And now we're trying to match based upon sameness, right?
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.800]   And like sameness is not the point of it.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.020]   I mean, there are even thoughts, right?
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.660]   About people then in some way seeking difference, right?
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.180]   And maybe pheromones are telling us that.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.880]   Like I actually know very little about that,
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.460]   but I certainly know that striving for sameness
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.540]   doesn't make good things happen in relationships.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.020]   I've been doing this for over 20 years
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.560]   and like I don't see that the alleged factors
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.120]   of sameness matter.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.700]   Again, unless they're so concrete.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.740]   Like if this person is absolutely gonna live
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.820]   in North America and that person's absolutely gonna live
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.140]   in South America, let's not potentially put them together.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.040]   But once we get away from almost that level of concreteness,
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.720]   let's look for something different
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.140]   and then like everything else, it simplifies, right?
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:35.600]   The higher we go up the ladder, the more simple things get.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.700]   If you're looking at the pillars, structure of self,
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.780]   function of self, you're creating the agency and gratitude,
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.980]   then what are you looking for
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.600]   when you're looking for a partner?
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.740]   A match in generative drive.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.420]   I want mine to be strong
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.460]   and I see that it's strong in this person.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.820]   They create in a way, you know what?
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.700]   I do science, they grow a garden.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.180]   We're generative together, right?
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.820]   Like that could be super compatible
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.060]   because we're looking at the one factor that really matters.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.160]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.820]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, AG1.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.220]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.800]   that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.820]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.000]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.740]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.660]   and the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.700]   or generally twice per day is that it's the easiest way
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.900]   for me to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins,
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.220]   minerals, probiotics, and fiber that I need in my diet.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.340]   Now, of course, it's essential to get proper nutrition
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.100]   from whole foods, but most people, including myself,
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.080]   find it hard to get enough servings
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.580]   of fruits and vegetables each day
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.700]   and especially to get enough prebiotics and probiotics
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.160]   to ensure gut health.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.000]   As you may know,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.820]   your gut contains trillions of little microbiota,
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.620]   the so-called gut microbiome,
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.560]   which establishes critical connections
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.500]   with other organs of your body to enhance brain health
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.260]   as well as to support your immune system
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.220]   and other aspects that relate to mental and physical health.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.620]   One of the most common questions I get is
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.460]   if you were to take just one supplement,
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.700]   which supplement would that be?
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.900]   And my answer is always AG1
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.500]   because by taking AG1, I'm able to ensure
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   that I'm getting all of the vitamins, minerals,
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.380]   and probiotics that I need to enhance my mental health,
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.900]   physical health, and performance.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.540]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.660]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.300]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.680]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.860]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.940]   to claim this special offer.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.540]   I'm realizing that most of what I and everyone else
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.640]   has heard about relationships is complete nonsense.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.760]   I really mean that.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.500]   I mean, it has occurred to me before
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.260]   because I've experienced both
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.020]   that the phrase is absence makes the heart grow fonder
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.700]   and out of sight, out of mind
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.140]   are in direct contradiction with one another.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.400]   So they're both true, depends on the circumstances
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.380]   and who the hell knows why.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.020]   You also hear opposites attract,
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.000]   but they don't stay together, right?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.100]   You hear similar, the important thing
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.180]   is to find someone similar to you
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.100]   or that there's like one person, right?
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.940]   That's right for you.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.620]   I mean, these are, if we really think about it,
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.540]   crazy notions,
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.100]   but they drive a lot of what people
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.740]   think about relationships. - They drive angst, right.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.180]   They drive angst.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.680]   They drive bad choices.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.240]   They drive situations that then create a sense of guilt
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.780]   and shame and inadequacy.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.540]   We mislead ourselves by not going to the basics
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.020]   of what is actually true.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.420]   Like, I mean, look at myself,
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.580]   make myself as healthy as I can be, right?
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.420]   Because if I'm healthy,
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.480]   I'll recognize a lack of health in the other, right?
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.180]   So it also protects us against bad relationships.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.980]   And then if I'm gonna make myself healthy,
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.860]   which we're describing how that looks,
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.100]   wouldn't I want someone who also
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.380]   wants to make themselves healthier,
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.700]   at least if we're gonna ally, right?
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:51.060]   Let's ally around making both of ourselves healthier.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.780]   - Absolutely, and we're going to go deeper
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.980]   into how to look into the map of self
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.880]   and how that relates to relationship,
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.580]   certainly more as we go along this discussion.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.700]   You've mentioned several times, however,
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.060]   about generative drive and that it really is
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.700]   the definition of like-minded in some sense.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.580]   And you also mentioned aggressive drives
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.900]   and pleasure drives, themes that we touched on again
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.300]   in episodes one and two,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.540]   but listening to those episodes
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.340]   is certainly not necessary to digest
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.220]   what we're talking about today.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.760]   Could you go a little bit deeper into the generative drive,
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.920]   flesh out for us what that is?
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.060]   I think generative, I think generator, I think energy.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.380]   I hear aggression or aggressive drive,
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.240]   I think as I think most people do,
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.720]   friction, maybe even conflict,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.940]   maybe physical conflict, maybe verbal conflict,
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.520]   but I know it's some of that perhaps, but a whole lot more.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.500]   And then pleasure drive and pleasure,
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.160]   some people think bliss, some people think delight,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.720]   some people probably have all sorts of specific things
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.060]   they think of with respect to pleasure.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.460]   So if you could just flesh those out for us
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.300]   a little bit more,
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.980]   because I think those are going to serve
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.740]   as cornerstones of today's discussion.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.480]   Sure, so drives, and in this case,
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.100]   the generative drive sort of exists within us.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.700]   And what they do is they're defining potential, right?
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.600]   So right now, one could argue if we just pause
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.440]   for a couple of seconds,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.240]   we're not doing anything generative in those seconds, right?
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.460]   But then we resume doing something
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.480]   that we believe is generative, right?
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.580]   So at the time we're pausing,
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.360]   that's when we can sort of look at that as a drive within us
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.040]   to make new learning, right?
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.600]   To understand things we didn't understand before,
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.860]   to spread a sense of goodness, right?
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.740]   So it resides in us in a way that is determined
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.260]   by a whole bunch of different factors.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.080]   Like everything else that's determined within us,
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.340]   there's a nature and a nurture component.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.420]   So some aspect of it,
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.560]   or what are the genetics that came down to us?
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.460]   What are formative experiences?
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.900]   But we can go in and alter that.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.100]   So if we see the drive as a set of potentials,
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.180]   like in that moment we pause,
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.820]   there's a set of potentials within us,
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.520]   like potential of where we can take our thoughts,
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.380]   our actions, our reflections, our decisions, right?
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.620]   That's the drive within us.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.700]   And it exists within us in a way
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.060]   that we could localize now.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.520]   Like if we think enough about,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.200]   okay, how much of a generative drive is there in a person?
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.300]   How much is that person looking
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.220]   to make a better life for themselves
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.540]   or a better world around them?
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.220]   And how do they feel about themselves
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.240]   and their ability to do that?
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.580]   How generative are they?
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.460]   Or how shut down or demoralized or envious?
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.340]   So we can, in a sense, localize that.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.020]   And again, the localization has these genetic
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.260]   and nurture components to it,
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.760]   but we can then go and influence that.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.500]   And that's the importance.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.220]   If the drive is a set of potentials,
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.700]   a set of possibilities,
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   then that drive is one in the same,
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.040]   pervaded with however we want to describe that
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.020]   with the agency and gratitude.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.440]   'Cause the agency and gratitude
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.940]   is sort of the operative form of that.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.400]   That's the verb, right?
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.420]   It's the drive actually driving something, right?
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.460]   So if you have a strong generative drive,
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.240]   then agency and gratitude are leading the decisions,
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.180]   the reflections are coming through that.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.020]   The aggression within us,
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.420]   or again, that's the historical word,
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.940]   but we can say aggression, assertion, proactiveness, right?
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.780]   All of this inside of us and our drive for pleasure,
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.460]   for gratification, right?
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.460]   That all is then, it's in us,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.820]   but it's observing the generative drive,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.700]   meaning the generative drive, that set of potentials
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.480]   and possibilities is dominant,
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.460]   which of course makes sense with agency and gratitude,
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.820]   those active verbs being what is most active, right?
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.640]   And then we're also gonna feel at times,
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.180]   and hopefully at a lot of times, that set of peacefulness,
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.460]   that sense of contentment, the sense of delight, right?
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.180]   What you're describing when you're doing the podcast
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.460]   and you're in it and all these good things
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.740]   are happening to you, right?
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.020]   There's a strong generative drive in you,
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.540]   that set of potentials are being actualized
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.340]   through the verbs of agency and gratitude,
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.300]   like you're doing it all right then,
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.580]   and as you're doing it,
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.820]   you have a sense of peace and contentment
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.780]   as you're enacting all of it,
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.740]   and then that makes you healthier,
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.400]   reinforces the generative drive,
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.260]   it protects you against the next sling or arrow
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.020]   of outrageous fortune that will come your way, right?
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.860]   You become more self-knowledgeable,
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.600]   you become stronger, right?
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.100]   And ultimately, that's what we're looking for,
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.000]   like that's the state of goodness,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.520]   and I believe that if you look historically,
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.760]   what is it that we're seeking?
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.940]   We can put so many words to it,
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.620]   and we're choosing to put these words to it.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.820]   I mean, I think that this is the structure
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.980]   because I think the science, the history,
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.980]   the clinical experience, the phenomenology,
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.980]   I think it all tells us this.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.840]   We can put different words to it,
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.560]   but what we're looking at when we're looking at truth
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.140]   and how to get to the happiness, quote unquote,
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.600]   that people have sought through the ages,
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.160]   I mean, I think we know enough now,
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.180]   we've learned enough that we can say,
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.540]   oh, this is what it looks like,
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:21.520]   and it fits the arbiter of all truth,
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.580]   which is as you get further up the hierarchy,
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.660]   it gets simpler.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.680]   That's true about humans.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.440]   What's going on in my own consciousness
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.460]   is very, very complicated, right?
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.060]   But if that's summing to, as we get higher up,
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.340]   to like I'm approaching the world
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.940]   with a lot of agency and gratitude, right,
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.660]   that's a lot simpler,
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.280]   and that's what can be common among us,
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.780]   which is why if my pillars are very different
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.060]   from your pillars and what we've struggled against,
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.740]   each is very different,
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.180]   and what we may still have to work against
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.500]   is very different,
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.140]   well, we can be extremely compatible as friends
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.100]   because are we working on ourselves?
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.340]   Are we fostering the generative drive?
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.260]   So we're coming at the world in that way,
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.660]   and agency and gratitude,
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.420]   that's the similarity, right, between us that matters,
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.020]   and ultimately we're looking at the potential,
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.900]   that every moment we're building the potential in us
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.980]   for what comes at the next moment,
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.740]   which is why we're describing the overlap,
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:24.100]   the point of commonality that really matters,
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:24.940]   that matters.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.780]   We're putting a label to it, right?
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.580]   We're saying it's the generative drive,
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.680]   but it is also that, okay,
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.900]   we both come at the world through agency and gratitude
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.680]   if two people are assessing compatibility,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.120]   but if we're looking at something to nest that under,
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.360]   and what seems most logical
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.820]   is the set of potentials within us
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.200]   that we're building and altering each moment,
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.800]   and then as I alter it in this moment,
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.200]   right, it's altered and it affects my next moment, right?
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.600]   If I do something that's just kind of thoughtless
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.920]   to somebody, you know, because I'm in a bad mood, right,
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.980]   then what am I doing?
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.400]   I'm projecting out my aggression.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.440]   I'm doing something that basically makes me less than,
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.520]   right, and then I'm gonna feel less in the next moment,
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.860]   whether that moment is about me or is about someone else.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.720]   The drives are the potentials in us,
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.880]   but we are actively working on them, determining them,
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.780]   changing them each moment.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:21.880]   - I'm well on board the idea that the typical pairings,
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.400]   let's call them the idiosyncratic pairings of, you know,
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.300]   musician with musician in many cases,
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.460]   but, you know, sometimes very verbal person
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.880]   with quieter person, you know,
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.100]   introvert with extrovert or introvert with introvert,
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:37.780]   that all of that takes backseat or it perhaps
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.600]   even back backseat and perhaps it even is out of the vehicle
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.260]   compared to the critical importance of generative drive.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.820]   - Right.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.760]   - When we think about generative drives in individuals,
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.700]   you beautifully described what a generative drive is
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.240]   and how it shows up in individuals.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.560]   When thinking about generative drives
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.800]   in romantic relationships, however,
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.040]   because generative drive can be expressed
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.520]   to varying degrees, does one often see that
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.840]   or do you think that a matching of sort of levels
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.160]   of generative drives is what fosters the best relationships?
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.120]   In other words, let's say somebody has
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.780]   a pretty high pleasure drive, but not as very strong,
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:27.360]   aggressive, also called proactiveness drive.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.200]   And so maybe like they watch a lot of Netflix,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.360]   like a lot of Netflix, but they're not even
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.000]   the sort of person that's like really excited
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.440]   about the shows and telling you about them.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.280]   'Cause there's a version of watching a lot of Netflix
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.140]   where the person is really interested in learning
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.560]   and in knowing, maybe even they're thinking
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.960]   about writing something, you know, poetry or a book,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.480]   or they're bringing some of that to their life, right?
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.220]   I mentioned it that way because watching Netflix
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.960]   isn't bad per se, right?
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.440]   It's not anti-generative.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.280]   - Is it an escape or is it generative?
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.840]   Is the person thinking about what they're going to do?
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.000]   They're going to write that book
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.160]   or are they just trying to numb out?
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.800]   And at the end of five hours in front of the television,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.840]   they don't know what those five hours were, right?
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.980]   There's no intrinsic value judgment based upon
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.840]   a lot of things that we make intrinsic value,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.760]   we make value judgments about, right?
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.800]   You have to look at who is the person, what is the context?
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   Are they being generative or not?
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.120]   - Yeah, some of the movies and shows
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.480]   that I've watched in relationships
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.880]   became the points of connection around, at least to me,
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.140]   tremendously interesting discussions on hikes
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.740]   that we took the next day and reflections
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.960]   on our own relationship and work and life.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.520]   And so I'm so glad that you point out
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.320]   that there's nothing intrinsically valuable
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.640]   or invaluable about something like Netflix
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.200]   or even intrinsically passive about doing something
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.520]   like sitting around or even reading books for that matter.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.120]   There's a passive version of reading great books also,
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.200]   people forget that.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.320]   It's hard to read a great book and not learn something.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.740]   I guess that's why they're called great books,
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.680]   but there is a version of that.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.520]   And I know many people-
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.080]   - People wanna possess the book.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.520]   I read the book and I'm gonna check it off.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.400]   I don't know what was in it.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.920]   Like people do that, that is not generative.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.560]   - So should we consider matching of level
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.960]   or expression of generative drives
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   as perhaps what we are all seeking in seeking relationship?
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.360]   And do you think that people tend to pair up,
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.000]   naturally pair up with people
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.120]   that have a similar level of generative drive?
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.280]   Or if they don't, do you think it leads to problems?
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.980]   - Right, yeah, I think that by and large people don't,
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.380]   that it's not the thing that we're thinking about
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.580]   and looking for in ourselves or others.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.940]   And I absolutely believe that it makes problems.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.160]   And let's take a look-
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.400]   - To not look, it makes problems to not look.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   - Right, it makes sense the way,
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.880]   the fact that we're not basing it upon generative drive
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.840]   does indeed I think make many, many, many, many, many.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.600]   And in fact, countless problems.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.680]   And I would take as an example,
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.460]   think about the idea of a trauma bond, right?
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.900]   A trauma bond is not a bad thing.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.240]   That sounds like a strong statement
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.420]   because the way that I hear trauma bond used
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.580]   is it's a bad thing, right?
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.000]   But it doesn't have to be.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.960]   So let's take a look at it.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.640]   Imagine that you have what people call a trauma bond.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.160]   You know, you have two people who,
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.320]   let's just, we'll make up a situation, right?
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.200]   They're functioning in the world around them,
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.920]   but they each have had some very significant trauma
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.800]   that is creating issues in them.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.120]   So let's say they're avoidance issues.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.740]   Person doesn't feel safe or comfortable
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.200]   in the world around them.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.800]   They get invited to places that they'd like to go,
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   but they don't go, right?
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.920]   They wanna go to the museum
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.640]   and see something really new and cool there,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.360]   but there might be a crowd, right?
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.280]   I mean, this happens, right?
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.040]   And let's say you have two people
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.920]   who both have this in them.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.480]   It could be because the trauma is similar.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.920]   The trauma could be night and day, right?
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.760]   But they each have this in them.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.320]   They could bond around that trauma
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.480]   in a way that worsens the trauma.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.680]   That's why people think negatively of a trauma bond, right?
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.480]   So if the case is that the trauma bond is not a good thing
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.960]   for these two people, you say, why is that?
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.280]   It's not because both of them have had trauma
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.600]   and both of them are impacted by trauma
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.440]   and both of them are impacted by trauma in similar ways.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.480]   It's not that.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.480]   It's that the drives are not in a healthy place
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.340]   and the gratification of the generative drive
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.240]   and the pleasure drives are not high enough.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.960]   So let's imagine the generative drive
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.640]   is could be relatively low in each of these people
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.560]   in one or the other,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.640]   or they could have a naturally high drive
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.800]   that's being thwarted, right?
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.960]   So there's something that's out of balance.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.280]   Where the drive is, the ability to express the drive, right?
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.120]   Is there enough agency, right?
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.800]   If there's not, like let's say one person
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.440]   is really, really shut down,
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.760]   that person can't stand their job, right?
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.960]   Okay, something is shutting that person down.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.340]   The generative drive wishes greater expression.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.720]   They go back and look at themselves.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.480]   You can bring that into line, right?
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.640]   But something is out of balance at the time.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.600]   The pleasure drive may be low or it may be high,
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.960]   but it may not be gratified.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   Maybe that that person loves museums
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.840]   and wants to go to the museum,
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.200]   but can't find that gratification, right?
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.400]   That's a possibility.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.600]   The aggression or assertion drive would be on the low end,
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.960]   right, but it could be higher.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.720]   Maybe if that person felt safer, right?
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.840]   That drive within them has a lot of latitude in it
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.540]   and maybe it could move higher, right?
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.840]   But something is out of balance in the drives
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.160]   and in their expression, right?
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.720]   That's the problem.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.620]   Because let's look at the other side
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.400]   where a trauma bond is a great thing, right?
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.380]   So each of the people in the example has trauma
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.740]   and they recognize it in themselves
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:55.600]   and they understand how it makes things harder for them.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.560]   And then they're communicating
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.560]   about how it makes it hard in the other, right?
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.200]   So maybe there's a lot of overlap, right,
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.120]   in social avoidance and sense of vulnerability,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.120]   but maybe there are things that are different
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.900]   in one person versus the other.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.480]   So then they can come together and say,
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.720]   look, what's the goal of life?
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.460]   Like, I would like to be as healthy as I can be.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.460]   I'm working on myself.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.200]   You wanna be as healthy as you can be.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.160]   We wanna be as healthy as we can be.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.340]   And if we're healthy, we also help each of us be healthy.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.580]   So maybe those two people,
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.280]   neither of which say would ever go to the museum
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.560]   on their own because the trauma inside of them
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.340]   is at a point it hasn't been worked through
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.100]   or it's at a place where they just simply
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.820]   feel too vulnerable, right?
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.680]   But together they can go to the museum.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.680]   And then the bond around trauma helps them be healthy.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.020]   The drives are in a better place
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.820]   because they're able to recognize,
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:53.980]   hey, there are things going on in me
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.260]   that I'd like to be different and better.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.420]   And you recognize that too.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.700]   And we can talk about it with one another, right?
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.060]   So they're in a healthier place.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.600]   And then from that healthier place,
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.060]   they build greater health.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.580]   - So much of what we hear about
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.660]   in terms of friction points in relationships,
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.060]   centers around it seems communication
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.940]   or lack of communication.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.600]   And as you're describing the role of the generative drive
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.900]   and healthy relationship,
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:23.660]   it seems to me that it ties back in every way
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.260]   to agency and gratitude and agency being
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.280]   such a critical element of communication,
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.220]   because wherever you've identified that,
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.580]   okay, there's a potential problem here,
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.160]   people with high generative drive in these examples
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.500]   seem to be capable of like self inquiry,
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.200]   asking the other person questions
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.020]   that bring them closer together
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.220]   and to a deeper understanding of the self.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:50.220]   I raise this because one thing that's often overheard
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.460]   or that I've overheard,
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.460]   I of course have siblings and friends are,
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.060]   and I'll place this in the way
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.780]   that I've most typically heard it,
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.540]   but I'm sure it exists in other ways too,
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.200]   which is the conversation in my head
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.140]   is one where a woman is saying,
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:08.420]   like they're with somebody or dating somebody
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.860]   and like, he's so clueless.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.540]   Like I wish that he would just do this thing.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.220]   Sometimes these are acts of chivalry,
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.780]   like maybe it's flowers or vacations,
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.420]   but more often than not it's a request
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:24.180]   or a complaint about a lack of proactiveness.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.180]   This is also what ratchets up to these very pan statements
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.100]   that you hear like, oh, there's no real men these days,
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.620]   or like there are no real men left or this kind of thing.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.140]   You also hear it in the reverse, right?
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.300]   You hear men making pan statements about women
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.580]   and here we're doing this in the context
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.460]   of heterosexual pairings,
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:44.460]   but of course it could all work just as well in homosexual.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.020]   Exactly, it could all work
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.500]   in the context of homosexual pairings too.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.780]   So you hear those sorts of things
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.340]   and it sounds like a lack of communication.
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.260]   Okay, maybe one person needs to be better
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.700]   at asking for their needs to be met.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.000]   Maybe the other person needs to develop more of an awareness
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.160]   of what the other person needs.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.020]   Of course, we all seem to kind of intrinsically wish
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.920]   that things would just happen for us
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   without the need to request them or ask for them,
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.160]   but I'm realizing again that all of that
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.960]   is distracting commotion
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.320]   because that's not really what's going on.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.680]   What's really going on, it seems,
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.700]   is that the engine behind communication,
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:26.900]   the engine behind curiosity, a desire to learn and know
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:30.280]   and create something from that learning and knowing
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.640]   in the relationship, the generative drive
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.400]   is really what's the issue
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.520]   or the lack of generative drive.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.880]   In any of those conversations,
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:41.800]   it seems one could circle back to that and go,
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.080]   okay, well, someone's not asking the right questions
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.400]   and therefore not doing the right things
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.960]   because they don't either have a sense of agency
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:52.000]   or they don't have gratitude for the situation they're in,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.760]   including their own ability to do that, right?
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.800]   So when you hear people aren't showing up
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.000]   for the relationship, they're not showing up
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.660]   or she's not showing up or again,
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:04.100]   let's make the pan statement go in the other direction
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:08.780]   that somebody just wants a lot of attention, right?
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.600]   They just need an excess amount of attention,
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.780]   won't let me do my own thing,
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.080]   but also wants me to work and be successful.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.960]   Again, these are stereotypes,
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.860]   but all of that seems very distracting.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.380]   However, all of it seems far simpler
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:27.120]   if we push it through this filter of generative drives
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   and whether or not it's being expressed.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.880]   Yes, yes, I think maybe the best example of this
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.500]   because it's so highly charged
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.760]   is imagine the pleasure drive
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.580]   through the lens of sex and sexuality, right?
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.700]   So imagine that people are in a pairing,
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:43.540]   they're in a relationship.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.460]   Regardless of how they got there,
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.640]   we're taking people who are in a relationship.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   And one has a sex drive, which means an interest in sex
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.440]   and maybe proclivities for a diversity of sexual experience
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.920]   that say, if we just, for sake of this example,
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.520]   we put on a one to 10 scale, that person has a two, okay?
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.440]   Now let's say the other person in the-
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.680]   10 being the greatest.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:08.340]   Yeah, sorry, 10 being right, that person is a two.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.960]   Now let's say the partner is an eight, okay?
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:14.140]   So there's a big mismatch there.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.180]   You think, how does that normally go?
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.840]   The two stays a two, the eight stays an eight,
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.800]   and things don't go well, right?
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.560]   It creates friction in the relationship at a minimum.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.540]   It blows the relationship apart at a maximum.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.320]   The person who's a two feels inadequate often.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   I mean, it's not always right,
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.560]   but this is how this often goes.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.020]   Person who's a two feels inadequate
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.320]   'cause the person who's an eight
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.700]   wants either more or different, right?
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.720]   And the person who's a two doesn't.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.880]   Now that person feels bad
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.280]   and they may feel bad about themselves
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.700]   or resentful of the person with a higher sex drive.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.560]   The person on the higher level feels now resentful
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.700]   of the person at the lower level,
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.760]   or maybe they feel like there's something wrong with them
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.180]   because their sex drive's too high,
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.360]   or they have an interest that the other person doesn't have,
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.040]   and now they start labeling themselves.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.560]   Like, this happens all the time,
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.640]   and it doesn't change most of the time,
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:07.240]   and the problems are enormous, okay?
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.760]   So let's see, how could that look?
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:15.000]   How would that look with really high generative drives,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.600]   and therefore the ability to think about self,
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.840]   to think about others,
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.860]   and to think about the us of the situation, right?
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.560]   The two people together, right?
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:27.840]   So they'd be able to talk about it
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.580]   in ways that wouldn't be faulting of the other,
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:35.320]   and would acknowledge what's inside of them.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.080]   Like the person with the lower drive could say,
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.640]   you know what, just things that doesn't strike me
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.480]   as more interesting.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.320]   I don't think about it more.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.040]   They could talk about all of that.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:46.200]   The person who wishes more or wishes different
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.160]   could talk about that too, right?
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.960]   And could talk about what they feel inside
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.220]   if there's a frustration of that,
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:52.920]   just like the person with the lower sex drive
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.200]   could talk about how frustrating it feels
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.360]   to feel pressured, right?
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.840]   So what are they developing?
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.160]   They're mentalizing, right?
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.960]   They're thinking about each other's emotional states,
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.600]   and they're coming at each other through agency
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.200]   and gratitude, like I'm so grateful for you.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.180]   The example is these people are partners,
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.620]   and they're happy with their partnership.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:15.560]   Like, oh my God, I'm so grateful I found you, right?
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.000]   They would each feel that way.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.480]   I'm so grateful you're in my life.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.720]   Like this happens too, right?
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.820]   And then from that lens,
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.920]   the two isn't going to become an eight.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.120]   The eight isn't going to become a two, right?
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.280]   But in general, in situations like this,
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.400]   there can be somewhere in the middle, right?
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.920]   And let's say the two says, okay, you know what?
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.880]   I can get out of my comfort zone a little bit.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.520]   Why don't most people try that?
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.520]   'Cause they feel embarrassed.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.060]   They feel self-conscious.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.680]   You know, they don't want to try new things or try more.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.600]   People get closed down
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.880]   because there's such shame around sexuality.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.800]   You can take people on any spectrum of sexuality
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.640]   and you will find shame, you know, not in every person,
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.780]   but across whatever population we're looking at
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.740]   because it's so emotionally charged.
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.240]   So let's say in a loving, caring relationship,
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.400]   you're like, that person feels the freedom inside.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.580]   Say, you know what?
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.660]   Maybe I could enjoy sex a little more,
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.120]   a little more often, a little more...
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.260]   That person thinks about it like somebody who's at a two
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.320]   can then move that to a different place,
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.580]   you know, a little bit more,
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.400]   or maybe even a lot more depending.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.020]   And then the person who's at the higher level,
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.440]   you know, the eight doesn't need another eight, right?
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.140]   In order to stay in the relationship.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.960]   But something may be more than a two, right?
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   And then let's say they come into the middle
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.140]   and then the person who's an eight realizes like,
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.020]   look, I love you and you love me
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.480]   and you out of your comfort zone, right?
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.960]   In order to do this and like, and wow.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.240]   And it's like more fun for both of us.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.160]   So like, you know what?
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.820]   It's okay, my higher sex drive, I'll deal with that.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.360]   That maybe just making it up,
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.700]   like I would like to do it three times a week,
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.920]   we're doing it two.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.040]   Okay, you know what?
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:48.860]   That's fine.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.020]   Both sides can live with it, but it is not threadbare.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.460]   It's not like, well, they can live with it.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.420]   It's like, no, number one, they can live with it.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.140]   Number two, it's better.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.300]   It's better, right?
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.360]   The two at one point was thinking,
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.900]   hey, anything more than a two is I can't do that, right?
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:05.740]   It's shut down.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.080]   The eight doesn't want anything less than an eight.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.740]   Now they're in the middle and their relationship is closer.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.960]   That's real.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.220]   That happens.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.620]   What is it relying upon?
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.600]   It's relying upon the generative drive
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.500]   to have the openness, the ability to communicate.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.460]   Maybe the person who's an eight say,
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.500]   has a sexual proclivity they're embarrassed about.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.020]   That happens all the time too.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.300]   But in the sense of acceptance of self
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.580]   and the belief in the strength of the relationship
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.140]   and the acceptance of the other,
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.620]   people can broach things.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.620]   Most people who feel like,
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.180]   oh, I could never broach that.
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.060]   It's not something bizarre or dangerous.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.000]   It's not something that in a relationship
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.900]   that's defined by the generative drive,
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.300]   the other person is likely to reject.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.900]   So let's define our relationships
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.600]   through the generative drive
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.440]   and let's cultivate in self and others
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.220]   the most generative drive.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.420]   If somehow, let's say person A and person B here,
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.420]   'cause it doesn't matter who's the eight and who's the two,
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.740]   has cultivated more of a generative drive,
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.580]   then maybe that person could give more to the other
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.100]   before that person can give back to them.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.000]   We have these, I think,
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.540]   completely nonsensical ideas about mutuality.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.380]   The idea that even in a situation
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.740]   that's supposed to be defined by love.
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.660]   And friendship is a form of love.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.040]   So friendship, a collaborative endeavor.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.780]   They have some affection in them.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.940]   Friendship can have love and often does.
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.220]   And let's say the love of romance,
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.020]   that there's supposed to be some equality.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.260]   The idea that, well, if I'm gonna give something,
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.580]   I want you to give something too.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:43.780]   It is not good if one person is always doing the giving.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.220]   Things are out of balance.
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.160]   But it is very healthy to be able to say,
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.540]   you know, if I can give something
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.980]   and you're not in a place to give something,
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.100]   let me just give something to you.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.540]   People don't always, or maybe don't often,
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.140]   depend on how we wanna look at it,
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.420]   give to others with a sense of freedom.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.300]   And you don't owe me anything either, right?
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.120]   Why?
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:04.960]   Because it comes from love.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.740]   It comes from the abundance,
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:10.700]   the excess of goodness in me coming through
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.100]   the agency that I feel, the gratitude that I feel.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.380]   And then what's more likely?
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:19.140]   You're much more likely, the other person, right?
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.260]   To sort of feel like, hey, I can go a little more.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.300]   You feel stronger, you feel empowered.
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.340]   Making someone feel worse or saying, you know what?
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.140]   I can give you something, but you owe me something back.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.780]   Even if that's tacit, I can give you this now,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.240]   but you kinda know that the other person's
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.980]   gonna end up doing the laundry for two months or something.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.300]   Like, this is not okay, why don't I just give something?
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.480]   Right, you're giving goodness,
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.860]   and then the other person actually gets the goodness,
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.020]   and they're more likely to find it within themselves, right?
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.900]   To then come a little out of their comfort zone,
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.540]   move their generative drive a little bit forward.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:56.540]   So gifts given to others with no expectation of return
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.020]   are gifts of abundance.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.580]   They're gifts that arise from the generative drive,
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.940]   and they make us more generative.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.700]   Think about the opposite, what often happens?
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.460]   Each person makes the other feel guilty, right?
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.480]   Right, oh, this person wants, he wants so much,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.320]   and look, there you are again.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.840]   Like, people feel terrible about that,
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.100]   or, you know, you don't want any sex, or this or that.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.660]   The other person feels terrible, like,
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.140]   that's why the two stays the two
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.900]   and the eight stays the eight, right?
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.140]   But it doesn't have to be that way,
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.580]   and it's also not that if both end up in the middle,
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.580]   say both are a five, that that's some compromised position
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.940]   that implies less.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.980]   No, that's the compromised position that makes more.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.140]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.420]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Eight Sleep.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.020]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.860]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.680]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast and elsewhere
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.820]   about the fact that getting a quality night's sleep
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.460]   on a regular basis is the foundation of mental health,
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.980]   physical health, and performance.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.340]   When we're sleeping well, everything goes better,
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.740]   and when we are not sleeping well or enough,
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.800]   everything in terms of mental health, physical health,
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.540]   and performance gets far worse very quickly.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.400]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.780]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment,
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.400]   and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.260]   you need your core body temperature to drop
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.880]   by about one to three degrees.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.680]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.840]   you need your core body temperature to increase
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.340]   by about one to three degrees.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.620]   That all becomes very easy
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.660]   when using an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.540]   because it allows you to program the temperature
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.940]   of your sleeping environment at the beginning, middle,
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.860]   and towards the end of your night when you wake up.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.800]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.200]   over two years ago, and it immediately and persistently
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.280]   improved the quality and depth of my sleep.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.260]   And as a consequence, I wake up feeling far more refreshed,
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.460]   I have enhanced mood, focus,
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.940]   and alertness throughout the day.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.260]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,

[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.760]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.040]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.200]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.760]   Based on my understanding of the generative drive,
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.460]   the aggressive, also we're calling it proactiveness drive,
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:00.300]   and the pleasure drive, and the importance
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.620]   of the generative drive being greater
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.860]   than the aggressive or pleasure drives.
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.300]   I can also see the potential problem
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.540]   of having like two eights along the sexual desire scale,
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:15.720]   or two nines, or two tens.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.460]   And actually I've observed a lot of examples of this.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:22.780]   For instance, if there are, let's say two nines,
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.720]   they're both people nine out of 10 on the joy
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.220]   and sort of proclivity for sex, adventurous sex, et cetera,
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.420]   on the very high on the pleasure scale.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:37.100]   Perhaps even so much so that they don't pay attention to,
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.900]   or one person doesn't pay attention to the critical need
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:43.740]   for points of compatibility to be met,
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.060]   like the desire to someday have a family.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.920]   I've known couples like this.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.060]   They're together for a long time.
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.580]   They seem to really enjoy one another.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.180]   I know nothing of their sex lives,
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.260]   but there just seems to be a very strong attachment
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.540]   around certain forms of pleasure
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.160]   that they both enjoy engaging in.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.620]   So this could be activities or travel.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:05.700]   I mean, here we're saying nine out of 10 on the sex scale.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.300]   But in many of those cases, there's one person saying,
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.680]   but I want to have a family someday,
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.080]   and they're just not into that.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.100]   Or perhaps even like, but he won't leave his wife, right?
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.940]   They're like involved in something that feels really good.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.420]   They're matching along some pleasure drive,
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.100]   but completely overlooking the larger goals
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.460]   of one or both people, right?
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:32.180]   And here I pointed to an instance of infidelity.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:35.700]   That's its own issues with morals, et cetera.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.880]   But you see this a lot,
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.480]   like people really orienting towards what feels good
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.160]   and who feels good to be with.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.140]   And that of course is healthy,
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.360]   but that's not the entire picture.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.080]   So would you say that what I'm describing
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.520]   is an example of where the pleasure drive
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.160]   has overcome the generative drive?
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.140]   Because in the case of somebody wanting a family
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.600]   and the other person already having one
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.940]   and being unwilling to leave that one,
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:03.700]   or the other person not wanting a family,
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.940]   that the generative drive of the person
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:11.060]   who wants a family is not being respected,
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.820]   or it's being undermined by this excess desire for pleasure.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.400]   Like they're just drawn into the moment
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.000]   and the amazing weekends,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.160]   but this person's incredible and they're charismatic.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.020]   And I can't tell you how many times I've had friends say
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.840]   that they admire the person they're with,
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.640]   but they know the relationship can't work
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.320]   because of all these other underlying issues.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.240]   Right, right, right.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.180]   It's interesting.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:37.760]   We both overestimate and underestimate
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.760]   what say love can do, right?
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.240]   People say, "Oh, love can do anything."
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.600]   No, if I spill that glass,
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.880]   love's not gonna put the water back in it, right?
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.940]   If I must live in North America
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.240]   and my partner must live in South America,
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.160]   like we're not gonna be okay, right?
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.560]   So we say these things in a very wishful way.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.720]   Love will overcome everything,
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.920]   like it doesn't overcome that, right?
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.840]   Or maybe it does in the right circumstances.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.000]   So think about if the generative drive
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.560]   is very, very high, right, in both people.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.720]   So both people have say a strong need
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.320]   to live in a certain place,
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.240]   they can find a compromise position.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.400]   Maybe they live half the year in North America
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.680]   and half in South America, but why?
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.280]   Because in that situation, the love between them,
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.200]   which is the generative drive in the relationship, right?
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.200]   So what does that mean?
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.000]   The first person has to have a strong generative drive,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.240]   be healthy, understand that even though
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.600]   I need to live in North America,
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.720]   does it actually mean that?
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.440]   Do I really need to live in North America?
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.120]   Right, I have to be able to see beyond myself.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.120]   And what does that mean to the person I love
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.980]   who needs to live on the other side of the world?
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.480]   If the other person can do that too,
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.720]   then in the relationship, which is a new entity, right?
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.140]   It emerges from one person and the other.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.980]   You can know everything about one person,
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.880]   everything about the other.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.520]   You don't know about the two of them together, right?
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.600]   So the two of them together are an us.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.660]   And if that us has a strong generative drive,
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:15.320]   which it can, if each person has a strong generative drive,
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.860]   they can bring to the state of emergence of the us,
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.240]   the generative drive.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.280]   And that's the, we're talking about a relationship,
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.960]   let's also say the love between them,
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.900]   and they can find a way through.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.600]   So the idea that like love cures all things,
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.840]   like we have to find what does that actually mean, right?
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.340]   It doesn't mean we have a lot of pleasure together, right?
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.240]   Or we like a lot of the same things.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.440]   Like that's not what that means.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.260]   And people can very, very much love one another,
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.720]   but not be aware of the limitations inside of them, right?
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.480]   Because maybe there are other things going on in them,
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.540]   like say childhood trauma, they love one another,
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.760]   but they can't get out of their comfort zone enough, right?
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.920]   So the point is if we make ourselves as healthy
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.380]   as we can be, and then two selves come together
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.420]   that are making themselves as healthy as they can be,
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:04.880]   then the us between them really can fit that definition
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.880]   of love and do anything.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.560]   But we have to define that in the right way,
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.600]   in a way that honors the truth, which again,
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.080]   is not a higher degree of complexity,
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.880]   it's actually more simple.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.300]   - So you gave an example of a romantic relationship
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.380]   where one person has a strong sex drive
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.080]   and the other a weaker drive.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.320]   And then we talked about an example
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.700]   where both people have a essentially high sex drive
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.720]   and where that could potentially be beneficial,
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.160]   assuming that the generative drive
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.600]   is also high in both of them.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.500]   And we also explored a little bit of how it can be bad
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.660]   for relationship if it exceeds the generative drive.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:45.340]   What about the aggressive proactiveness drive?
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:48.440]   How does that show up in romantic parents?
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.840]   If one person has a high proactiveness,
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.660]   AKA aggressive drive, and the other person does not,
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.720]   what does that look like?
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.620]   And do you see that often in your clinical practice?
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.000]   - Sure, sure.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.600]   If this makes sense, maybe we look at that example
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.880]   of the person who's a two and the person who's an eight
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.560]   on the sex drive scale, right?
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.400]   You'd say, okay, the person who's a two
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.560]   who's trying to raise that, right,
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.120]   has a strong generative drive.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:15.960]   What does that mean?
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.280]   The person thinks, you know what, I think I can do this.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.480]   I can set myself about this.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.240]   I see it will make my relationship better.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.720]   Like, I'm gonna give it a try.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.680]   That's the generative drive in action.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.820]   The pleasure drive, the person may look at that and say,
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:29.320]   look, maybe this can be more fun for me, right?
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.900]   Like, has it been that fun for me?
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.280]   If I have a low pleasure drive,
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.200]   could I start enjoying this more?
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.920]   And then maybe that moves up, right?
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.700]   Or maybe I have a higher pleasure drive,
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.060]   but it's not been gratified
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.620]   'cause I haven't been able to be open and honest.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:43.180]   Like, let me see if I can make that better.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:46.780]   Then what's active, what the person is doing
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.200]   is then going to the aggressive or assertive,
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.420]   proactive, right, to that drive
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.180]   and going to the potential in that drive
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.100]   and mining some of what's in it.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.680]   Like, yeah, how am I gonna do that?
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.220]   I'm gonna bring myself to bear, right?
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.880]   And like, that's not an easy thing.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.020]   It's not like that person then all of a sudden decides
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:07.500]   to be more sexual, right?
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.920]   There has to be a lot of communication
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.940]   between the two people, a lot of discussion
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.260]   of what setting might be best for that,
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.940]   what helps the person feel understood
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:15.820]   or feel more comfortable.
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.660]   Like, there's a lot then to do there.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.020]   And the person may even need to go back to the pillars,
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.140]   right, 'cause the person may feel like,
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:26.780]   whoa, I don't think I can do that, right?
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:28.260]   And then it is, that's not good.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.380]   I wanna do that, right?
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.380]   What is it that I can't do?
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.900]   There's a realization there.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.660]   And then maybe the person who's an aide
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.220]   because they're so well-connected gets it.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.460]   Okay, you can't do that.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.420]   Like, let me support you, right, in whatever way,
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.500]   while you're figuring that out,
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.420]   'cause they're both generative.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.340]   They wanna figure that out.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.180]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.380]   When you say go back to the pillars,
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:50.420]   you mean go back to exploring the structure of themselves
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:51.900]   and the function of themselves
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.540]   so that they can, for instance, get some insight
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.600]   into what sorts of defense mechanisms might be in place,
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.300]   what they're paying attention to, or their behaviors,
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.620]   like maybe even health-related behaviors
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.700]   that could be impacting their sex drive,
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:10.860]   but maybe even things that reside at a deeper level,
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.120]   the unconscious mind, you know,
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.140]   talking to somebody till they make a connection
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:19.140]   around shame or some story that they've integrated
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.580]   into their thinking at a subconscious level.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.060]   - Right, right, just an example that I see a lot
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.820]   is avoidance, where, again, not always,
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:30.100]   but let's say the person who's the two
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.180]   on the sex drive scale who finds like, I can't do it, right?
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.460]   Wow, I just can't bring myself to do it, right?
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.940]   And then they go back and they explore.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.700]   This happens a lot, where there's avoidance.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.140]   And then we get curious about the avoidance.
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.660]   'Cause the person's like, I just,
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:49.060]   there's something, I'm just, I don't want to do that, right?
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.220]   Okay, so there's avoidance.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.660]   We identify avoidance.
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:53.120]   We also identify that it's not healthy
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.260]   because the person does actually want to do that
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.900]   'cause it's good for their relationship
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.540]   and it could be good for them too.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.860]   And then maybe we start looking at unconscious mind, right?
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.020]   Or conscious mind, right?
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.580]   And maybe we don't find,
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.660]   'cause it's easy now if I said,
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.040]   oh, there was a major trauma
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.340]   that the person hasn't processed.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.740]   Sometimes it's that.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.620]   But a lot of times it's not that.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:14.140]   Maybe that person just never learned
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.620]   to feel comfortable with sexuality.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.660]   Or maybe the way that they experience
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:24.060]   or are attracted to sexuality was disparaged
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.660]   or denigrated, right?
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.640]   Or they had some bad feeling about it
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.780]   'cause the society and the culture told them that.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.820]   Or maybe they had a couple of bad experiences
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.500]   where they were treated in a certain way.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.340]   And then it's like, okay, that person comes by that honestly.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.900]   There's not a major trauma there.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.420]   In fact, unfortunately, there's a trauma
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:44.140]   that's almost predictable from the way our society
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.380]   has been structured.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.860]   So a person can go look at that.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.860]   I'm like, right, I never learned how to do this
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.840]   or how to be comfortable with this.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:57.400]   Or I learned that I'm not good at it.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.460]   Or I learned that no one will enjoy it with me.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.860]   But that's not true.
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.540]   These are situations not in the sight
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.180]   of a loving relationship, right?
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.460]   Now that person is able to bring that knowledge to bear,
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.460]   whether it came from the unconscious mind
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:12.800]   or the conscious mind.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.380]   And then that's how you work to start shifting things.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.780]   Like that was then, this is now, right?
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.580]   It is not then when say the person say in high school
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.340]   had a sexuality that others didn't approve of
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:24.200]   and made them feel bad.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.040]   Well, guess what?
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:25.860]   It's not then.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.180]   And like, that's unfortunate, it's wrong, it's unjust.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.100]   We're gonna honor and validate all that that is.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.800]   But we're also gonna look at that that was then,
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.900]   this is now, and you get to behave differently now.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.340]   You're an adult now,
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:40.980]   and adults get to choose their relationships
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.580]   and you chose a good relationship, right?
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.000]   So this is the kind of thing that can get that person
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.300]   to the point where they can go back up through.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.780]   Now, what happens at the end of it?
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.340]   The geyser is stronger.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.280]   There's more agency.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.260]   There's more of a sense of gratitude, right?
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.100]   Why?
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.260]   Because the person can attach themselves more to,
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.900]   I'm so lucky to have this person,
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.340]   as opposed to, damn it,
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.780]   I wish that person didn't have a higher sex drive, right?
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.800]   So the person, and they feel better about themselves
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.140]   instead of what's wrong with me
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.740]   that I don't have a higher sex drive, right?
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:10.700]   So they wish the other person had a lower sex drive,
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.380]   or wish they had a higher sex drive.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.300]   That's not grateful.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.880]   I'm grateful I am who I am
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.460]   and that I have any sex drive at all
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.200]   and I'm grateful for this other person.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.820]   Now, through that, that change,
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:27.280]   they can go back and better access the assertion,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.660]   the proactive drive, the aggressive drive,
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.580]   whatever we wanna call it,
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.340]   because they've taken away,
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.920]   they've gone and worked through the barrier to it.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.020]   Then they're able to be a little more
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:36.980]   out of their comfort zone
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:39.140]   and the other person meets them there, right?
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.380]   And they start having this healthy thing between them
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.260]   where the us, that is them,
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.020]   the love between them gets better, right?
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.320]   And then where do they find themselves?
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.260]   That's how they get to the five,
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.340]   which is not a compromise
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.840]   between eight and two that satisfies neither.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.180]   It is a compromise between eight and two
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:01.700]   that is way better for both and for the relationship.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.500]   - I'm curious about common pairings
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.660]   that you observe in the clinical setting
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:11.340]   and not to focus on the bad,
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.600]   but if there are common pairings
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.700]   that rarely lead to a good outcome,
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:21.340]   I think it's worth us learning about those
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.860]   simply because they're common
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:25.860]   and they lead to a bad outcome.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:28.300]   And a discussion of this sort
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.260]   could potentially help people avoid such pairings
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.900]   or at least recognize that they're in such pairings.
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:36.380]   And I realize, of course,
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.140]   because of the way that we're framing things
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.100]   during this series,
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.340]   that any time we talk about a pairing,
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.460]   we're really talking about two maps coming together,
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:50.500]   forming a new and somewhat independent map
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.140]   that represents the relationship.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.180]   I have to assume that many people in the world
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.140]   have maps that are very, very healthy,
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.600]   and they're probably even those rare individuals
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   that don't need to go into those cupboards
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.960]   that reside within structure of self and function of self
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:06.800]   and do any work.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.960]   But for those of you that are just listening
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.800]   and not watching this,
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.840]   I'm sort of smiling as I'm saying that
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.920]   because I don't actually believe any such person exists.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.360]   I think all of us, even the healthiest among us,
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.420]   could be even healthier
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.440]   and express more generative drive
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.240]   and more positivity for ourselves
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.300]   and for the world, were we to do that work.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.140]   So it's a lifelong-
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.860]   - There's no end point to that.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.700]   That's beautiful.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.480]   We can do that forever as long as we're here.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.540]   - And should, I do believe, right?
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.780]   Which is one of the reasons for having this discussion.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.620]   - Exactly.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.580]   - Nonetheless, I have to imagine
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.500]   that there are also a lot of people out there,
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:46.460]   perhaps most people who still have a lot of work to do.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:48.660]   And those words, a lot perhaps,
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:52.600]   are in boldface, capital, underlined, highlighted letters.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.440]   Right?
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.560]   And as a consequence,
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.660]   we see relationships in the world that are not healthy.
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.880]   What are some of those common unhealthy pairings?
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.800]   I think it's worth spending
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.120]   at least a little bit of time on this.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.800]   As we talk about this,
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.240]   I think that we should make a sort of somewhat simplified,
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.740]   but hopefully helpful distinction, right?
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:15.220]   So there are people who are coming at coupling
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:17.640]   from primarily health, right?
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.380]   And again, this isn't to criticize people
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.280]   who aren't coming at it from primarily health.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.880]   We all want to get to where we're coming at anything
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.820]   and everything from primarily health.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:29.260]   And there, a lot of the problems are those simple things.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.300]   Like, wow, I can't believe it didn't work out.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.480]   I play the trumpet and he plays the clarinet.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:36.640]   It's like, no, that wasn't a real set of factors.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.600]   That's why it didn't work out.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.280]   Like, it's more in that realm.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.120]   It's not always just that,
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.980]   but like that kind of stuff is a big factor, right?
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.320]   When we look in the other realm
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:51.320]   where there's a significantly problematic
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.800]   mental health issues, right?
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.840]   Which people come by honestly,
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.680]   but need to face if life is gonna get better, right?
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.960]   There are two common paradigms there.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.840]   Now again, there are way more than two ways
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.040]   this can happen, but I'm gonna highlight two
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.700]   that we see a lot and maybe more than anything else
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.680]   in the clinical setting.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:19.320]   So the first gets called repetition compulsion, right?
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.740]   But don't be very, very clear.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.420]   I do not believe that there is any such thing
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.280]   as a repetition compulsion.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.420]   A compulsion is something that one cannot control, right?
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.220]   What's going on inside the person is very, very complicated
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.480]   when they're making decisions that lead to repeating a cycle
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.920]   and those are things that can change, right?
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.660]   And do not have to be compulsive.
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:42.960]   So people are often struck by why a person
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.600]   is in the same bad relationship seemingly
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.280]   that they have always been in,
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.180]   but with a different name on the other person, right?
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.680]   I mean, people will say this,
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.760]   like it's that person's fourth abusive relationship in a row
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.700]   and it seems to be just the same person
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.540]   with a different name.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.360]   Like that people say that a lot.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.920]   They say that about themselves, they say that about others
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.200]   and it's very, very baffling.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.120]   I mean, people have often been in my office
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.920]   very upset about that, like realizing they're repeating
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.800]   and they don't know and it's frightening
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.960]   and you can get a lot of fear and vulnerability from that,
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.840]   but there's a way of understanding that
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:20.840]   because the limbic system, right?
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.680]   The emotional parts of our minds
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.280]   don't care about the clock and the calendar, right?
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.400]   So trauma impacts, well, it impacts the whole brain,
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.800]   but trauma impacts the limbic system.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.720]   It creates strong, negative emotion
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.560]   that then stays with us regardless of time.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.440]   It doesn't care about time, right?
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.960]   So imagine now a person gets in a relationship
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.960]   and the relationship starts to become abusive, right?
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.920]   I mean, it's easy to say that
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.000]   and then move on to something else.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.960]   What's that like for that person?
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.200]   What does that feel like when that person
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.040]   who they may have seen as a protector or friend, right?
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.860]   Is now cursing at them, denigrating them, pushing them,
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.800]   hitting them, I mean, it's terrifying.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.720]   It's horrible, right?
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.920]   So there's a deep impact, a traumatic impact on the person.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.040]   And a lot of the time, most of the time,
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.040]   like all trauma, it triggers shame, right?
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.760]   So trauma triggers shame in us.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.680]   If the trauma is strong enough,
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.380]   it changes us as we move forward in the world.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:29.520]   And then we are different in a way that makes the past
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.280]   very immediate in the present.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.000]   So what the person then is trying to do,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.680]   and there's been a lot of thought about this
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:40.580]   over the years in the fields, trying to understand this.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.520]   And I think in many ways,
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.240]   doing a good job of understanding this,
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:49.240]   that the "repetition compulsion" is the drive,
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.320]   and I don't mean drive, like we're saying,
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.360]   there's a push inside the person
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:56.320]   to try and make that right, right?
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.840]   With the idea that if that person
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.280]   can be in that situation again, right?
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.800]   And I don't mean in the exact situation
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.260]   when someone raises a hand to them,
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.360]   but they can navigate a relationship.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.760]   It's like they thought it was a good idea the first time.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.700]   So they don't want to feel like that was a very bad idea.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:11.700]   So I'm going to make it right.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.680]   And then I'm going to be okay.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.000]   And I'm going to be whole, right?
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.320]   Because the person is driven by fear and vulnerability
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.020]   and the shame of the trauma, right?
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.720]   So then they're trying to make it right
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.880]   because the limbic system doesn't care
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.120]   about the clock or the calendar.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.440]   If you can make it right now,
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.000]   you make it right in the past, right?
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.560]   'Cause that system doesn't care about the past.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.600]   It's driven by trauma.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.020]   So then the person's trying to figure out
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.240]   something that is different.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.440]   They're trying to choose that person,
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.960]   behave in the relationship.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.060]   They're trying to make things different,
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.320]   but they've selected for a dramatically high
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:48.500]   pretest probability of the same thing happening again,
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.120]   which is why, you know,
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.600]   if I could count the number of times
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.280]   that someone has said to me,
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.320]   oh, you're not going to help me,
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.640]   especially at the beginning of therapy,
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.500]   there's no way you can help me, right?
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.920]   My last five relationships were totally terrible.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.380]   Like, there's no way, there's no hope, right?
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:06.480]   People have said that to me.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.460]   Someone has, the last three, the last five, the last nine.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.800]   And I will say back,
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.500]   if you tell me seven different stories
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.520]   of relationships with seven pretty different people,
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.840]   several different relationships as they evolved
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.040]   and the same really bad outcome, I'll agree with you.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.680]   But you're not going to tell me that.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.800]   And that's why there's hope.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:32.160]   And no one has ever told me seven different stories, right?
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.120]   Feel like, wow, you just can't do it, right?
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.640]   No, and again, even if there were seven,
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.600]   you know, I'm saying the same thing for exaggeration, right?
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.560]   But there are, but there aren't, right?
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.400]   What is it?
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   It's the same thing seven times.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.460]   That's what it is because the person is repeating
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.760]   and if they can understand the what and the why,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.280]   why are they selecting?
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.440]   How are they selecting someone?
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.160]   What's going on inside of them?
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.660]   We go back to the structure of self, the function of self.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.280]   We address what is there.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.180]   Then that absolutely can change.
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.760]   And then what will we talk about
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.740]   is that person then goes out to find another relationship.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.740]   Even if they said they never, never, never would again,
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.480]   like now they're making the decision to go out.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:12.000]   This is to say, what relationship are you looking for?
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.600]   Your second.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.840]   You're the first one seven times, no harm, no foul,
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.700]   but you can navigate the second
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.600]   because they're in a different place.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.060]   They're coming through agency and gratitude
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.000]   instead of denigrating themselves.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   If you're, what's wrong with me?
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.280]   What's wrong with everybody else?
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.800]   I'm here, right?
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.740]   Even though like some bad things have happened to me,
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.260]   look at what I can bring myself to bear.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.900]   I can go out there and try and find someone
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.720]   I can see with clear vision.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.620]   Now there's agency, there's gratitude.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.960]   And then that person can go out
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.240]   and find relationship number two, that's a really good one.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.320]   - In the example you gave it's very powerful
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.340]   and also very extreme, an abusive relationship
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.460]   where someone is sadly getting hit or screamed at.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:59.400]   Oftentimes it seems people end up
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.000]   in repeated unsuccessful pairings,
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.480]   meaning unhappy pairings of maybe someone
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.520]   who's very strongly assertive.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.960]   Maybe we would say have a strong, aggressive drive.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.340]   Some people might even call them a narcissist.
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.560]   That phrase is thrown around a lot these days.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.280]   I mean, narcissist, gaslighting, like projection.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.200]   These phrases are thrown around all the time.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.320]   I think with frankly very little understanding
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.560]   of what they actually mean,
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.000]   unless they're coming from a qualified clinician.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.800]   Is it the case that somewhat passive
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.480]   or submissive people are drawn to narcissists?
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.040]   Are narcissists drawn to submissive people?
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.420]   I think these questions ring in a lot of people's minds.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:45.200]   - If I could clarify something
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.040]   that I think I maybe could have said in a clearer way.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.500]   You pointed out that the example I gave
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.260]   was a very strong one, an extreme one, right?
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.800]   So as a physician, I think I naturally gravitate
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.580]   to the extreme circumstances
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:01.120]   because they're the ones that bring the greatest risk, right?
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:05.120]   But we are talking to people in those settings, right?
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.840]   But most people are not in those extreme settings, right?
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.540]   But that extreme serves as a model
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.080]   for how things that are less extreme can happen.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.960]   So when I think, right, we're sitting here
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.420]   talking to everyone across the spectrum
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.640]   and most relationships that are not going well,
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.840]   thank goodness, are not gonna be that extreme.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.000]   The repeated patterns aren't gonna be that extreme.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.080]   But it's just as important to pay attention to a pattern
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:33.680]   where one person really is sort of more deferential
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.700]   than they would like to be to the other,
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.000]   than is comfortable to them.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.960]   And they're seeking someone ultimately
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.700]   who's just a little bit more assertive.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:42.820]   And that's not some disaster,
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.280]   but it can not go well over time
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.880]   where that person slowly gives up, say,
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.560]   more and more of themselves.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.280]   And there can be that repeated pattern.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:52.880]   You hear people say, yeah, it was a pretty good,
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.080]   pretty equal at the beginning.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.080]   But then, I just had like less and less of a say or every,
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.960]   or then more and more,
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.280]   like I just became the whole relationship, right?
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.160]   So it's no less important when it's less dramatic, right?
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.460]   Because the relationship still goes in a wrong way.
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:13.280]   When it's more dramatic, there's more risk, of course.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.800]   But most people are gonna be in the less dramatic,
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.240]   but super important category.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:23.000]   And I think it's important to point that out too.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.280]   How much of what we're talking about
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.960]   is nested on people's deep, perhaps understandable desire
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.960]   to just make sure that the other person doesn't leave?
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.960]   I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've heard about
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.080]   or observed relationships that from the outside,
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.160]   it seemed really unhealthy.
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:45.800]   But it also occurred to me that people are doing things
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.680]   on both sides of the relationship
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.480]   that ensure that the other person doesn't leave.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.040]   So I'm not talking about a physical trapping
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.080]   of someone in the environment.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.220]   I'm actually talking about the opposite.
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:56.200]   I'm talking about somebody going against
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.940]   their better judgment and doing things for the other person
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:03.000]   or against themselves or both,
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.320]   perhaps even in the context of what looks like healthy family
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:11.400]   like doing an excessive amount of raising of children
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.000]   or excessive amount of work to support the family
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.420]   simply to ensure that the other person doesn't leave.
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.480]   - Right, right.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:23.480]   Here again, we can look across the spectrum, right?
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.800]   So before this, you had talked about relationships
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.280]   that can be very unhealthy, like a narcissistic person
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.320]   and how can those relationships develop?
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.160]   It's important that we touch on that in the context of this
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.320]   because that's sort of the extreme example.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.080]   So people who are narcissistic,
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.280]   meaning a narcissistic character structure.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.380]   Now we're getting into the realm
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:43.920]   of significant psychiatric problems
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.100]   and people who are narcissistic are exploitive, right?
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.580]   They're a bottomless pit of need arising from vulnerability
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.140]   and yes, they can be helped.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.100]   And if someone out there thinks I'm narcissistic,
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:56.060]   then I'm not trying to be negative or mean,
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.660]   like you can get help and you can be better.
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:58.860]   That's the whole point of what you
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.220]   and I are talking about here, right?
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.820]   So people can change, but someone who's coming at the world
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.460]   through a narcissistic character structure
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.940]   is exploitive of the other and then can say survey a room
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.140]   and find that person who's had trauma
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.780]   such that that person is gonna be desperate
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:15.180]   not to leave a relationship.
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.580]   And then they can exploit that person
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:17.980]   and often behave in awful ways
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:19.620]   and the other person won't leave.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:20.860]   Now I'm giving an example.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:24.140]   It's not the case that way every single time,
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:27.620]   but that's the dominant picture
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.760]   if you have a narcissistic person
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.200]   and who is that person more likely to pair with
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.740]   and then you sense the vulnerability,
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.320]   the desire for the other person not to leave.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.540]   So, and that person would have to have then
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.260]   significant problems in themselves,
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:43.080]   like potentially instead of a pathological level
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:46.560]   of narcissism, a pathological level of dependence,
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.480]   for example.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:52.260]   So we're in the realm then of real problems.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.740]   And again, real problems can be treated
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.480]   and real problems can be improved
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.720]   and that's why we have clinical care,
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.840]   but it can also serve as a model for seeing
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:04.760]   the ways that are less dramatic, right?
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:09.480]   So there are many people who through the desire
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:10.960]   for the other person not to leave
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.980]   and we could call that attachment insecurity, right?
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:17.280]   And maybe if we leave away the stereotype version of it,
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.320]   right, the person doesn't feel securely attached
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.640]   to the other person, right?
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.880]   And somewhere inside of them, they've learned
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.280]   that if they're more pleasing, right?
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.400]   If they give up little parts of themselves,
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.400]   that person won't leave, right?
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.900]   It might be because that's why their mother
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.880]   didn't leave their father when they think about it.
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.140]   It might be that's why their father left their mother
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.640]   because their mother wouldn't do that, right?
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.880]   Whatever it may be or it may be their own
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.520]   prior life experience or who knows,
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.280]   something they read but forgot.
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.300]   I mean, usually it's something more salient, not always,
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.240]   but they've internalized something
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:53.720]   that leads to a compromise of the self.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:57.520]   Now again, that's not what attachment insecurity is, right?
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:01.820]   Attachment insecurity is just feeling some insecurity
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:02.840]   about the attachment.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.720]   So for example, I feel attachment insecurity
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.840]   about just about everything, right?
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:11.560]   I've had the experience of sudden,
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.640]   very painful losses happening, right?
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.520]   So I have attachment insecurity
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.920]   in the sense that I'm worried, right?
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.020]   I get anxious about like people going away
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:24.880]   and I can wanna over control,
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.120]   but I recognize this inside myself.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.800]   I try and do my best to say,
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.440]   look, I don't want that to make me unhealthy.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.500]   I wanna recognize it.
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:34.520]   I wanna find some happy medium where I honor that in me,
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.520]   but don't get carried away with it
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.320]   to the point where I try and over control
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.760]   and then I push my relationships away, right?
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.760]   So I say that because there's such a contrast
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.840]   between that kind of attachment insecurity,
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.480]   which can involve over control, right?
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.820]   And the kind of attachment insecurity
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.680]   that can involve compromise of the self.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.840]   So, and we wanna be very, very careful.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.880]   Like we wanna be careful, like what is a trauma bond
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.960]   and what does it mean?
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.800]   We wanna be careful.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.120]   What is attachment insecurity and what does it mean?
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.760]   A certain kind of attachment insecurity
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.780]   can lead a person to make progressive compromises of self
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:10.920]   that are not good and healthy for them.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:14.160]   - I'm curious about some of these unhealthy relationships
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.520]   from the other side, meaning from the side of the person
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.780]   who is let's hope not, but in some cases exploited
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.720]   or who's being taken advantage of
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:27.100]   or in this scenario of a narcissistic person
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:30.840]   or an abusive person is the one who's taking the abuse.
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:34.640]   Often it seems the victim in that scenario
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.560]   will be truly stuck in that situation.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.780]   They can't leave for financial reasons or kids
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:41.980]   or their own internal workings,
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:44.280]   their psychological machinery
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.280]   has them locked into that in some way.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.200]   And it's that locked in by psychological machinery
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:50.540]   that I'm interested in.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.180]   And I think a lot of people are interested in
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:56.020]   because from the outside, we just look at that and say,
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.400]   why doesn't the person leave?
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.140]   Why don't they just leave?
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:03.120]   But clearly there's something about that situation
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.420]   that quote unquote works for them.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:08.580]   And by works for them, I don't mean that it's adaptive,
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:11.680]   clearly it's maladaptive, but that works for them.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:15.040]   The possibility I raised earlier, perhaps is relevant here.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.200]   You know, maybe it works for them
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.900]   because they know that the narcissist
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:22.080]   gets some sort of internal reward
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:25.920]   for engaging this kind of dynamic and therefore won't leave.
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.000]   And the other person not leaving
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   is of more value to them than feeling safe even, right?
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.920]   So it's trading one form of safety for another.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.600]   Or perhaps the victim as we're calling them in this scenario
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.320]   is somebody who feels a great sense of reward
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.660]   by serving somebody more powerful than them.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:47.600]   This raises all sorts of interesting questions
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.440]   perhaps about power dynamics as well,
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.800]   which I certainly have questions about.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.280]   But what are some examples of the internal workings
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.840]   of such a person that reside within those bins
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.160]   of structure of self or function of self
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:04.320]   that would put someone into that sort of situation
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:07.560]   and lead them to stay in that kind of situation?
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:10.880]   - Yeah, well, any situation like that,
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.980]   if it's, as you say, working for a person,
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:15.720]   which at times, you know, we see that from the outside
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.720]   because like things continue to go along
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.520]   and things continue to go forward.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.640]   But that only works for someone
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.960]   if they don't have the understanding,
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.160]   the empowerment that we would wish
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.980]   for anyone and everyone to have.
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.520]   So what is going on inside leads that person
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.040]   to feel a sense of an inability to change, you know,
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.760]   whether they can't see their way out of it
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.640]   or they kind of could, but could never navigate to it.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.940]   And there's a problem there
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.760]   if that's working for someone, right?
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.360]   Because we're talking about something that's exploitive,
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.840]   right, that's abusive, regardless of how it's abusive.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.440]   And I think, I believe that can only happen
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:02.240]   in the context of being demoralized, right?
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:05.080]   Or the circumstances of being so disempowered, right?
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.960]   You know, if someone just can't go 10 feet from home,
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.920]   like there's situations of outrageous amounts of oppression
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:15.900]   of a person where the person just cannot choose differently.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:19.720]   And there's situations where we as stewards of all of us,
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.280]   where the government may intervene, for example, ideally,
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.720]   right, that someone would come in and help that person.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.840]   But barring that kind of outlier,
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.280]   a person would only be in that situation
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:32.760]   in the context of being demoralized.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:37.760]   And that demoralization would come from too low a drive
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.160]   for assertion, being proactive, aggression, right?
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.460]   That that drive, its realization is too low.
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.860]   And if we give people the understanding
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:52.860]   and we give them the help, the means,
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:55.500]   they don't have to stay in abusive situations.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.860]   Like we see this in situations
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.700]   where our society will intervene
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.280]   or someone helpful will intervene.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.400]   Some person or entity will intervene and help a person,
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:09.580]   help that person to understand what's going on
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.080]   inside of them that leads them to feel
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.600]   that things can't be better, they can't do better,
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.000]   or that they're not worth better, or whatever that may be,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.180]   and help them to find the empowerment
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:24.680]   to then navigate themselves out of the situation.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:28.020]   And here again, I think it's not just agency,
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.920]   but it's agency plus gratitude, right?
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.040]   Including gratitude for having a self
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.680]   that could leave a situation.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.260]   When people are in situations like that,
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.500]   we talk about people as beaten down.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:44.060]   It's a way to kind of capture like what I think
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:47.340]   that feels like and how much suffering there is
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:50.840]   in those situations to be in that place
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.680]   and to not have the agency to get out of it.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.080]   Then the person is not feeling
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.180]   a sense of gratitude for self, right?
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.660]   They feel so bad about self
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.300]   that there's nothing to be grateful for, right?
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.840]   And there is so much to be grateful for, right?
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.400]   I mean, we could go through any person
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.900]   in a situation like that,
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.120]   and we could list wonderful things about that person,
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.700]   adaptive things about that person,
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:13.320]   kind things about that person, diligent things.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.660]   There are things like that in every person.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:19.280]   But if the person can't see that,
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.500]   they can't attach to that,
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:23.280]   they can't have the agency and gratitude,
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.860]   then they stay in a situation
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:30.200]   that is really defined by the agency and gratitude,
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:33.520]   and therefore that aggressive assertion, proactive drive
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.480]   being expressed at such a low level.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.460]   - I can see how a healthy relationship
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:45.180]   could exist in relative isolation, not complete isolation.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.740]   And here again, I'm referring to her
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.980]   thinking about a romantic relationship.
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:51.520]   I can see how a healthy romantic relationship
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.540]   could exist in relative isolation,
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:57.500]   a few friends, some contact with family members,
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.500]   or in great connectivity with friends
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.740]   and family and neighbors, et cetera,
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:06.500]   and still be a really great romantic relationship.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.660]   - Sure.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:09.500]   - I can also see how the sorts of relationships
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.300]   that we happen to be focusing on at this moment,
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.180]   which are this unhealthy dynamics,
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:18.820]   are made far worse by lack of connectivity to outsiders.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:21.920]   In fact, a previous guest on this podcast was David Buss,
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.780]   who's a professor of evolutionary psychology
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:25.320]   down at the University of Texas, Austin.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.180]   And he talked about some of his research
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.500]   into the dark triad.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.020]   These are narcissistic, Machiavellian,
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.460]   sometimes also sociopathic individuals,
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:36.260]   and how that plays out in romantic relationships.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.140]   And it's a terrible thing,
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.620]   but an important thing to understand,
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.860]   given the unfortunate frequency that that occurs.
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.540]   But one of the things that I remember so clearly
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:50.780]   from that discussion with David Buss was that
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.900]   even when there isn't sociopathy
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:55.620]   or a strong desire to destroy the other,
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.340]   that in these sorts of relationships,
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:00.180]   there's often an attempt to isolate the person,
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:04.000]   first by isolating them from their family,
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.740]   also from friends and coworkers,
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:08.740]   but all with the goal of convincing that person
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.820]   that no one else would want them
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:15.160]   as a way to make them quote unquote voluntarily stay.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:18.300]   In other words, to undermine their sense of safety,
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:20.020]   to ramp up their sense of anxiety,
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:22.260]   except in the presence of that individual.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:26.820]   And I'm remembering that now because as we're talking about,
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:28.260]   why wouldn't somebody just leave?
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:31.940]   Why wouldn't they just tap into that agency and gratitude?
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:36.540]   It's clear that the oppressor in this kind of relationship
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:39.580]   has a real incentive to try and undermine
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.780]   agency and gratitude.
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.220]   Because of course with those,
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:44.800]   they would be revealed for what they are
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.600]   and the person would feel enabled to leave.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:50.740]   Taking us back once again to the critical need
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:53.020]   to cultivate agency and gratitude,
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:54.620]   not just in unhealthy,
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:57.020]   but certainly in healthy relationships.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.460]   - Right, I mean, I think the principle here
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:02.180]   is that darkness always favors the oppressor.
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:06.260]   So the oppressor wishes for darkness.
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.820]   So you wanna isolate that person, right?
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:11.800]   Because when people see that things are better
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.800]   for someone else, they realize things can be better, right?
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.020]   When people are told by someone that they're worthwhile
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.220]   or they're funny or they're pretty or they're smart
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:24.220]   or whatever the case may be, they may take that inside, right?
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.820]   You know, they may take inside, oh, maybe I am, you know,
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.500]   I'm handsome and smart maybe, or they start thinking about
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:34.300]   that they're very basic concepts that allow a person
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:39.300]   to entertain new ways to look at themselves, right?
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.140]   So the person who's oppressing
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.820]   wants that person to live in darkness.
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:46.940]   They don't want them to see that there can be better.
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:49.460]   They don't want them to be directly told
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:52.180]   that they're better than how things are.
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:55.100]   And that same darkness on the outside,
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.620]   say the lights are out around the relationship,
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:00.780]   is the goal of the oppressor on the inside.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.460]   Now, again, the oppressor may know this
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.780]   and be doing it consciously,
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:06.060]   but often this gets played out in unconscious ways,
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:08.260]   like the constant denigration of someone.
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:10.340]   The person isn't saying inside, gosh,
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:13.840]   I'm trying to reduce their agency, their aggressive drive,
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.660]   really down to zero, right?
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:16.700]   But that's what they're doing.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:19.180]   Somewhere inside, there's a knowing of that,
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:21.320]   even if it's an unconscious knowing.
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:25.700]   And then what the impact of that kind of abuse over time
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:29.740]   is a lower and lower and lower ability
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.980]   to bring oneself to bear.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.060]   Less proactive, aggressive, assertive,
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.340]   lower sense of agency and gratitude.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:40.620]   That's really the definition of being demoralized, right?
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:44.960]   And that kind of abuse is always promoting demoralization
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:48.540]   because demoralization is the darkness on the inside, right?
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:50.020]   Just as envy is too, right?
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.920]   Demoralization is a form of darkness on the inside.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.700]   Envy is no less dark.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:58.680]   Envy may be a lot more active, right?
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:02.300]   But in both cases, there's no knowledge, there's no growth,
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.640]   there's no wisdom, there's no learning, right?
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:07.040]   So they're the states of darkness.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.380]   And what can happen in a way
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:10.940]   that's really so tragic to think about
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:14.760]   is you often can have an abuser, an oppressor,
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:18.580]   who is living in total darkness inside,
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.640]   living through the lens of envy.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.300]   And then you can have a person who is being oppressed,
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:28.220]   who is being exploited, who's living in darkness,
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:31.460]   but they're living in the darkness of demoralization.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:35.940]   And now that's a very sad thing to say, to imagine.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:38.720]   And it's been a very, very sad thing to see, right?
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.460]   If you do clinical psychiatry for long enough,
[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:45.660]   you see a lot of this and it doesn't have to be this way.
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:48.340]   Now, even the people who are oppressing
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.380]   have it within them the majority of time
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:51.460]   to make things better.
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:52.720]   And we do see that.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.380]   I took care of a man a long time ago
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:58.340]   who had been terribly abusive to his family.
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.540]   And it was always unclear to me.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:05.200]   It had happened years before that he just understood.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:10.140]   And again, I never understood what happened that he got it.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:12.620]   And the man really made change.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.480]   Like, again, I don't know what the circumstance was
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.740]   that made that motivation to him,
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:17.420]   but he went back and looked at himself.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:20.620]   And he went back and looked at how his father
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:22.700]   oppressed and terrorized the family
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:25.580]   and how he just did it with automatically, right?
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.500]   Because what was rooted in his own fear of vulnerability
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:31.020]   and he's gonna lose his family and not be a man anymore
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:31.980]   unless he oppresses them.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:34.860]   Like, he recognized all of it in him
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:37.420]   and he had changed it so dramatically.
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:39.780]   He had removed himself from the family system.
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:42.660]   And when I got to know him, it was years later
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.200]   and he was reintegrating back into the system
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.500]   because there had been such prolonged change
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.620]   and he had communicated to the family
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:52.520]   his understanding of self.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.420]   So it's not impossible.
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:57.160]   Even someone who is abusing, oppressing,
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.660]   coming through a narcissistic character structure,
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:02.580]   there's no therapeutic nihilism here, right?
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:05.700]   Things can change and things can change in the oppressor,
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:08.300]   which isn't excusing that, right?
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:11.860]   I mean, a person who's doing things is morally culpable,
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:14.500]   right, they often are criminally legally culpable.
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:18.660]   So that is all true just as the ability to change is true.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:21.720]   And then the person we think about more commonly
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:22.940]   in this situation, of course,
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.700]   is the person who's being oppressed
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.300]   and there can be change there too.
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.140]   But a problem is how hard it can be,
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:33.200]   the impact of the isolation, right?
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:36.780]   And also the dearth of resources to really help people.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:40.220]   Like, it's an actual true story of a woman
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.060]   who I believe with all my heart
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.940]   could get out of the cyclic abusive situation she was in
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:50.340]   if she had a carburetor, a carburetor, right?
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:52.700]   She had a car, the car didn't function.
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.680]   She had a place to go, right?
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:57.580]   That where others wouldn't know that she was there.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:00.220]   And the problem was just a few hundred dollars
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:01.620]   to change the carburetor.
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:03.060]   But it was like, there's no place to go,
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:06.900]   there's no resources, and we as a society don't help people.
[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:09.300]   And that may be that someone helped that woman
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:12.160]   and got her a carburetor and she drove away, right?
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:14.660]   But it shows how we can bring ourselves to bear
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:17.820]   as a society to offer people help,
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:21.360]   which sometimes is like the lifeline the person needs.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.580]   And maybe that person really needs a safe house
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:25.660]   or something very dramatic,
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:29.600]   or they need a carburetor to get away from being terrorized.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.260]   But a lot of times it's just community support structures,
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:36.780]   good structures around people in communities
[01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:38.820]   that can offer them support in situations
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.500]   that may be less dramatic.
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:42.020]   Opportunities for interconnection,
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:45.500]   which sometimes people can find through social venues
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.700]   or through religiously affiliated venues.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:51.460]   But the idea that community support systems on all levels
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:54.060]   make a huge difference, that's how,
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.360]   there's another level right beyond the relationship, right?
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.980]   It's the society, it's the culture, right?
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.000]   And that's how we on that next level of emergence,
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.660]   beyond the individual relationships can foster goodness,
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:08.960]   can foster health in each and every one of us.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.260]   - How does some of these same dynamics play out
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.480]   in non-romantic relationships?
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.260]   So for instance, in the workplace,
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:19.840]   I was weaned in academic laboratories.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:23.420]   So what's most familiar to me are, gosh,
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.020]   unfortunately numerous examples
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.280]   where people working in laboratories, not the same as mine,
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:31.180]   'cause I've been very fortunate to have amazing,
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:35.220]   benevolent mentors, quirky and outrageous at times,
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:37.380]   but benevolent nonetheless.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:39.500]   But others around me have been in laboratories
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:43.420]   where for instance, the workload was just ridiculously high.
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:46.660]   Like the demand far exceeded what any person could do.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:51.140]   And if somebody had, God forbid, a cold or children,
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.820]   like it was near impossible to impossible
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:56.100]   that they could meet the standard there.
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:01.020]   Or stress dynamics, pressure cooker dynamics
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:05.420]   that made it what anyone would call a toxic environment.
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:08.380]   You see this also in law firms, you see it in companies,
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:12.060]   you see it in families, you see it in friendship circles.
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:17.020]   How many movies are about teens oppressing one another
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:21.380]   through bullying and ridicule and practical jokes
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:23.780]   that are anything but funny,
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:27.100]   that are downright destructive and on and on.
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.780]   And so often the victims in these cases,
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.320]   if it's not a Hollywood movie,
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.100]   feel as if that's their only choice
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:40.100]   because to leave is to essentially have no other options.
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.900]   It's not that that's the only option is to stay,
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.460]   it's that to leave is essentially to leave science.
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:48.580]   Because these people in positions of power
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.580]   have the louder voice, they have the megaphone,
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.540]   they write the letters of recommendation,
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:54.480]   the law firms, people talk.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:59.160]   As I kind of spool this out in a long form question,
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:02.220]   I'm realizing I can't think of a single exception.
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:04.660]   Like as long as there are going to be people interacting
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:07.860]   and people talking about their interactions
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:10.340]   and people in positions of power,
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:12.580]   this sort of dynamic is going to take place.
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:13.460]   - Right, absolutely.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:17.780]   Anytime you have a closed system without accountability,
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:22.340]   you're just rolling the dice for that kind of oppression.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:23.980]   We need accountability.
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:26.660]   Think about theoretically what should have happened there.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:29.600]   There should be higher order accountability, right?
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.380]   Whether it's in a company or university
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:32.760]   or wherever it may be,
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:35.000]   there should be higher order accountability
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.880]   that is reasonable and rational.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:39.560]   So it's not then acting in a top-down way
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.080]   that would be over-controlling.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:43.120]   Are you telling me exactly what you kind of can't say
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.220]   or what you kind of can't do?
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:46.700]   And sometimes there's too much rigidity
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:48.680]   that can be enacted top-down,
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.700]   but the problem runs both ways.
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:53.700]   If there's no accountability from the bottom up,
[01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:57.580]   then that person is just simply stuck, right?
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:58.420]   Why?
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:01.820]   Because the system we've put into place has failed, right?
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.700]   And this is where we're talking now
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:06.140]   about not just individual relationship
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:07.700]   with two people relationships,
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.860]   but now we start talking about systems of people
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:12.400]   and systems of people are another level of emergence
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.600]   with a personality, so to speak,
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:16.200]   an environment all their own.
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:17.540]   You can know everything there is to know
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:19.020]   about each person in the system.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:21.140]   You don't know about the system,
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:25.640]   but what you do know is that accountability is necessary.
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:29.860]   I mean, probably if we added up all the examples in history,
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:32.620]   you know, we'd have to talk about them over 1,000 years,
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.980]   right, I mean, how many examples do we have
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:37.460]   that close systems without accountability
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:40.780]   are just rolling the dice, they breed oppression?
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:42.340]   You know, this is true,
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.820]   and I've been at several different places,
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.540]   so I'm not trying to implicate
[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.660]   this is any one place versus another,
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:50.560]   but I was part of a medical treatment team.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.200]   So this is a hierarchical medical treatment team
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:55.980]   of maybe seven people, give or take one,
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:57.620]   depending upon the circumstances,
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:59.260]   where there was physical abuse
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:00.820]   going on in the treatment team.
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:05.540]   This is true, and I'm not saying this
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:07.140]   in some exaggerated manner
[01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:09.620]   where somebody brushed up too close to someone
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:13.540]   and they slipped, no hurting someone on the treatment team,
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:14.900]   right, two different people
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.900]   who are being hurt by someone senior.
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:21.760]   So this is using a major university in a clinical setting,
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.040]   right, and it's not again,
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.880]   it's not like that's the be all and end all,
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.960]   but you think about the alleged sophistication
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:28.920]   of the people in the system,
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.920]   the alleged empowerment of the people in the situation,
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.400]   which did not put a stop to that.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.140]   So we need to have accountability.
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:39.420]   The accountability has to be reasonable.
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:41.320]   It doesn't mean over control,
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:43.600]   but it doesn't mean under control either.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.640]   And if that person is being overworked,
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.280]   as you described, with no way of winning
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:51.040]   or harmed on a medical team,
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:54.880]   and there's no way that that person can change that,
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:57.260]   the system has failed that person
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.400]   and failed them dramatically.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.960]   And guess who suffers?
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.700]   Everyone does, right?
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.520]   That person suffers, right?
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.480]   And the science that's being done
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.780]   or the medical care that's being provided
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.200]   is important to all of us.
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.640]   Anyone could be the patient
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.520]   who is being taken care of by the team
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.880]   where one person is hurting a couple of the others.
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:20.760]   You think that medical care is gonna be optimized, right?
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.440]   Is the science gonna be optimized
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:25.280]   that we're utilizing to try and make our lives better,
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.660]   live longer, be in less pain?
[01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:29.320]   What's happening there is envy.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:32.700]   That person who's oppressing other people is driven by envy,
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:35.120]   whether it's a narcissistic character structure
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.020]   that acts almost exclusively through envy
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:41.000]   or it's envy that is in this person's life in this way
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.360]   or not another way, does it matter, right?
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.080]   What's going on there is envy
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:47.560]   and envy is nothing but destructive, right?
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:50.720]   The generative drive is nothing but productive.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:53.560]   Envy is nothing but destructive.
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.680]   - Could you remind for people
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:58.400]   that perhaps may not have heard episodes one and two yet
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.240]   that envy is perhaps not just a desire
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:04.680]   to be like somebody else,
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:07.080]   that envy in the context that we're discussing here
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:09.680]   is something quite possibly different.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:11.720]   - Right, and there's a varying lexicon,
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.360]   which is why it is important to define it
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.200]   'cause I think people learn it in different ways.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.080]   I've heard it talked about in different ways.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.000]   So to define that,
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]   there's a difference between jealousy and envy.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.300]   And again, we could choose different words,
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:26.560]   but this is the way I learned it that's been most impactful.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.560]   Where jealousy is benign, right?
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.320]   It's the idea that if I see
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.240]   that you have something that I don't,
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:34.400]   then I think, oh, well,
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.520]   maybe I could work harder and get that thing, right?
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.080]   Or if I can't have that thing,
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.000]   like maybe it's a person is younger, right?
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.600]   Okay, I can't make myself younger.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:45.920]   Then I can think, okay, through a lens of gratitude,
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:47.640]   is that the only thing about me, right?
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.760]   I can't think of anything good about myself, right?
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.120]   Other than maybe I could be younger.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:55.000]   I mean, if you come at that through the lens of health,
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.860]   it's like, it's okay, right?
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.360]   It can serve to motivate people to like try harder,
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.120]   work harder, take a look at themselves
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.480]   and be more accepting of who they are
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.240]   and what their circumstances in life
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:08.160]   and what kind of control they can enact
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:09.440]   and what kind they can't.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:11.280]   It's okay, right?
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.280]   Envy is different, right?
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:19.280]   Envy comes at that problem from the perspective
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:24.960]   that bringing down the other person, right?
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:27.800]   Is just as effective as bringing up the self.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.220]   That's why envy is destructive.
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:35.100]   So someone who might see another person
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:40.100]   and they envy them their youth, right?
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:42.600]   They envy, they want that.
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.920]   And they wanna bring that person down, right?
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.520]   'Cause I can't make myself younger,
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:49.200]   but then they realize I can't make that person older either,
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.740]   but they can do other things to them, right?
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:54.360]   They can sexually harass them, maybe.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.720]   They can make terrible jokes that are really insulting
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.960]   and humiliating, maybe, right?
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:02.240]   There are all sorts of things a person can do
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.680]   to bring down someone else.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:06.640]   The inaction of envy is destructive.
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.680]   And I truly believe this,
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:13.160]   that people who come at the world very strongly through envy
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.480]   by and large in narcissistic character structure,
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:19.600]   this is a small percentage of the population,
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:24.600]   but that small percentage does most of the damage on earth.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:27.540]   Right, it's a strong thing to say.
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:30.640]   But when I think about studying political science
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.920]   and thinking about history and learning medicine
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:35.320]   and learning about psychiatry and sociology
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.320]   and really trying to look at the world
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:42.320]   and thinking what drives a person on a medical team
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.520]   who's gotten to be a senior physician
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:48.880]   to physically hurt doctors lower on the hierarchy, envy.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.920]   Right, that person feels terrible about themselves
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.200]   and then is being destructive to those people.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.200]   Same thing is at work in the lab.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:58.320]   The same thing is at work when people start wars
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:02.080]   of destruction that just simply harm other people
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.080]   and we can see no other sense of it.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.400]   That from the individual setting
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.220]   all the way up to the world setting,
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:11.040]   we see the destruction of envy
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.360]   and we also see it inside of us
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.240]   because a person who's enacting envy
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:17.640]   in the world around them is never,
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:19.600]   there's no chance of happiness.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.140]   Hence the idea of a bottomless pit, right?
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:25.040]   Whatever you get, let's say an envious person
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:25.940]   who wants more money.
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:27.780]   I wanna have more money than anybody, right?
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:30.800]   I want everyone to have less money than me, right?
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.480]   So then they come at the world through the lens of greed.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.560]   When they get more money,
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:37.960]   how long does that make them happy, right?
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.360]   This doesn't mean money is bad or having money is bad.
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.920]   It just means if you're coming at the world
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.320]   through the lens of envy, right,
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.780]   and that lens is specifically focused on money,
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:49.240]   then you'll be a greedy person who is never satisfied
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:51.820]   even if you have $10 trillion, right?
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:53.120]   So it's never good.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:57.840]   It takes away from that person any possibility of happiness.
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:00.040]   And if you see people, work with people
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.200]   with a narcissistic character structure,
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:05.420]   there can be a sense of a very brief happiness
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:06.260]   in the moment.
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:08.060]   Like I'm happy because I realize
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:09.480]   I have something someone else doesn't.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:11.600]   I'm happy because I'm thinking of myself.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.820]   And even though I feel very insecure and vulnerable inside,
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:16.440]   I have a whole set of defense mechanisms
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.640]   that let me turn those tables around
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.520]   and then feel good about myself
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:22.220]   in a way that places me above others.
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:24.300]   Whatever's going on in that person,
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:28.360]   it may bring some very brief gratification in the moment,
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:29.740]   but that's not happiness.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.640]   Hence the need for the gratification
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:33.700]   over and over and over again.
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.960]   Narcissistic people are the least secure,
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:39.640]   most diffident people on earth.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:43.660]   They just have a phenomenally healthy defensive structure
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:46.680]   that comes about in order to try and protect them
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:48.680]   that leads them to go to the opposite.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:50.400]   Some of what's called a reaction formation,
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.000]   going to the very opposite,
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000]   denial, avoidance, rationalization, projection,
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.320]   very unhealthy defenses that then leads that person
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:02.460]   to protect themselves from any help
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:05.740]   while they are frantically trying to gain some goodness
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:07.520]   that makes them feel good for a split second
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.400]   and then disappears forever.
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:14.080]   Hence the tremendous predilection for destruction.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:17.560]   - How do you and how should we think about power dynamics
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:18.680]   in relationships?
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.740]   And perhaps starting with romantic relationships.
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:25.060]   I've heard it said before that there's always power dynamics
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:26.800]   in relationships of all kinds.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:28.080]   I don't know if that's true or not,
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:29.840]   but I've heard that.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:32.620]   And I've also heard that that's particularly salient
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.280]   in romantic relationships,
[01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:36.520]   independent of whether or not it's a homosexual
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:37.720]   or heterosexual relationship,
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:40.160]   that there's always to some extent or another
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.680]   one leader and one follower.
[01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:47.380]   This is a interesting, perhaps a controversial idea,
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.060]   but I've heard it enough times
[01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.120]   that I want to know more about it.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:55.560]   - Sure, so power dynamics of course, very important,
[01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:59.360]   but also something we tend to be so over reductionist about.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:01.360]   I mean, this idea thing that there's always a leader
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.600]   and there's always a follower.
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.660]   Every single relationship, right?
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.880]   That's true on balance.
[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:09.020]   Like we tend to be so reductionist.
[02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:12.680]   And then what we do is we miss the real power dynamics
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:13.600]   that are going on.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.920]   Just like I said in a previous episode
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.420]   that I think my math minor has helped me the most
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:20.120]   for like all of life, right?
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:22.140]   I think a power dynamics course
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:24.880]   that I took as an undergraduate in political science
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:27.440]   has helped me the most as a psychiatrist.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:29.280]   Took it long before medical school
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.000]   because that class taught me so much about power dynamics.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.360]   I thought it was gonna be about overt power.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:38.420]   Who has power over whom and tells whom to do what, right?
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:42.240]   But what I learned is so much of power dynamics are covert.
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:43.320]   They're under the surface.
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.760]   For example, they're the things that are not said.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:47.560]   Something that was called at the time, at least,
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:49.600]   the issue of the non-issue, right?
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.920]   Where there's an issue between two people,
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:54.600]   like this person never takes out the garbage.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:56.160]   That person always takes out the garbage.
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.680]   That person is resentful about it.
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.680]   Both of them know,
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:01.880]   but the person who always does it can't say so
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:02.960]   because if they say so,
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.080]   the first person will punish them in some other way, right?
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:08.440]   By not taking out the garbage, then the place smells,
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.380]   that person goes to work
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:11.980]   and the person who's at home has to take it out, right?
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:15.880]   That's one example of the issue of the non-issue.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:19.720]   Other examples are where someone is looking and smiling
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:21.880]   and being really nice to someone
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:24.080]   who they know is gonna physically harm them
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:27.080]   if they bring to light that they're actually not happy
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.020]   and don't feel good about that person, right?
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:31.400]   So from the dramatic to the non-dramatic,
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.240]   unstated power dynamics are going on all over the place
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:37.440]   and they're in every single relationship.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:39.160]   I mean, unless a person is in a relationship
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:41.600]   with someone else and they're both comatose,
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:43.800]   no, I guess only one of them has to be comatose, right?
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:45.680]   There are power dynamics going on,
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:49.200]   but again, it doesn't mean that they're unhealthy, right?
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.180]   'Cause there are always power dynamics.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:53.060]   So then what are we looking for?
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:55.400]   And again, there are a lot of things we could look for,
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:58.680]   but we could talk about really two primary things.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:02.920]   One is look for the non-obvious
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:05.400]   and two is the give and take.
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:08.180]   So the first, even in our own relationships,
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:11.080]   because it's interesting how many people will say,
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:13.660]   "Talk about the power dynamics in their relationship."
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:14.940]   They're not always saying,
[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:17.160]   "Here are the power dynamics in my relationship,"
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:19.080]   but they're telling me about them
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:22.260]   and they're telling me about the things that are overt, right?
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:23.600]   Now, somewhere inside of them,
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.760]   they know that they can't really raise issue A, B, or C,
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:28.080]   or there'll be some retribution,
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:29.760]   whether it's small or large,
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.960]   or they might even know everything's okay
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.040]   and that person is happy,
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:34.560]   but they know I'm not giving them room
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:35.800]   to say that they're not happy.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.080]   And that could just mean if they say they're not happy,
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:41.800]   then I'll come home a couple hours late the next day
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:43.340]   and that person will feel some attachment
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:44.540]   and security because of that.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:47.880]   And there are all sorts of ways this can play out,
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.880]   but since so much of power dynamics are unstated or covert,
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.940]   kind of like the iceberg of conscious and unconscious,
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:57.840]   there's an iceberg of power dynamics.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:00.660]   So to think about including in one's own relationships,
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:02.420]   whether it's a neighbor, it's a friend,
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.120]   it's a work relationship, or most charged, it's romance,
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.580]   what's really going on between us, right?
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.020]   What's really going on between us?
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:14.220]   I'm not looking to tell myself lies, right?
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.820]   I know that I may not be able to understand all of it,
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:18.420]   but let me stop and think about it.
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:20.760]   And people, if you ask people to stop and do that,
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:24.460]   they can say, yeah, this is really not okay.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:26.740]   Or, you know, because sometimes they don't know
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:29.060]   that it's there or they don't want to know that it's there.
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:31.780]   And the therapy work is trying to guide them
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:34.200]   to there's an immense power disparity maybe
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:36.360]   in the relationship when they're presenting.
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:37.200]   No, everything is equal.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:38.800]   It's a good supportive relationship.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.220]   You hear that a lot.
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:41.500]   And of course, it's not always
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:43.280]   that there's something bad under the surface,
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:44.420]   but a lot of times there is.
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:46.780]   And even something mildly bad is not okay.
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:48.060]   And can cause problems.
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:49.740]   And sometimes there's something very bad.
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:52.220]   So look for the non-obvious.
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:54.740]   And then the second is that give and take
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.500]   is a very good sign of health.
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:58.620]   Is a very good sign of health.
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:01.620]   So if a person can kind of see that there's give and take,
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:03.220]   and it might be about something as simple as like,
[02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:04.980]   who chooses where we go to dinner?
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.140]   Okay, you know, sometimes one, sometimes the other.
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:08.700]   It depends who has a stronger feeling.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:10.940]   Or it may be that person always decides
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:11.760]   where we go to dinner,
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:13.600]   but the other person's okay with it, right?
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:15.420]   And that person always decides what movie they want.
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.740]   The other person, right?
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:19.540]   So the idea that there's give and take,
[02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:21.960]   and then in periods of time
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:24.820]   where one person may be in a more difficult place,
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:27.060]   one person has a significant loss, right?
[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:28.660]   Or an injury or an illness,
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:30.560]   then you see that that shifts a little bit.
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:32.900]   One person is giving more, right?
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:36.460]   But then ultimately the idea is that's from the outside,
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:37.300]   right?
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:38.900]   If one person is giving more to the other,
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.700]   there's a generosity of spirit
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:43.740]   in both the giving and the accepting, right?
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:46.260]   That leads them to then be stronger together.
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.860]   So even when people say, well, they're imbalances.
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:51.580]   In some way, if you just look at what's going on day to day,
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:54.660]   but in a healthy relationship with high generative drive,
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:58.300]   the periods of imbalance strengthen the relationship.
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:04:59.660]   But you see this with friends
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:02.060]   where two people have a pretty equal friendship.
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.500]   And then like one person has something difficult happens
[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:06.160]   and the other person is there for them.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:08.060]   What's true on the other side of that?
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:09.580]   They're better friends, right?
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:12.340]   And it's also why we often want to be interconnected
[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:13.320]   when we're healthy.
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.660]   What if something bad happens to both of them, right?
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:16.860]   It's good to be interconnected
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:19.700]   and friends and family can be supportive to us.
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:22.540]   So the idea that give and take is healthy,
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:24.700]   I think is very central.
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:26.260]   So just looking for evidence.
[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:27.660]   It's often, if I don't understand
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:29.140]   like what's going on in the relationship,
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:30.440]   maybe it's early in the therapy
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:32.140]   or it's just been kind of opaque
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:33.520]   or I can't figure it out.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:35.380]   I'm looking for, is there a give and take?
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:36.300]   Because then I'm gonna think,
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:39.160]   okay, more likely than not things are healthy.
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.900]   If I see an imbalance, whether the person knows it or not,
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:44.140]   I'm thinking more likely than not it's unhealthy.
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:46.820]   And then there's just clues along the pathway
[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:49.660]   of my efforts to understand.
[02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:53.900]   - The non-obvious piece is really intriguing
[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:55.060]   as is the give and take.
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:57.620]   And I really appreciate that you brought up the give and take
[02:05:57.620 --> 02:05:59.960]   because that's a very concrete place
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:02.380]   that we can all look and ask ourselves.
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:04.820]   Even if people aren't in romantic relationships,
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:08.580]   like what is the give and take in a given friendship?
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:09.460]   And as you mentioned earlier,
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:13.220]   it doesn't have to be scripted one for one, one for one.
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:15.700]   Maybe it balances out over time or maybe it doesn't.
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.500]   I mean, I've had friendships
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:20.940]   that have lasted many decades even
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:23.800]   where I can honestly say I'm always the person
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:25.700]   to reach out to the other person.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:28.060]   But when they connect,
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:30.660]   they connect with such a depth of attention
[02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:33.040]   that I don't feel any deprivation whatsoever.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:34.620]   In fact, I don't think I've ever considered
[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:37.060]   that I'm the person that always reaches out until today.
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:38.460]   And so it doesn't bother me whatsoever.
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:42.080]   I feel infinitely rewarded in the relationship.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:44.340]   Like it's generative, it feels generative.
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:46.060]   Right, it doesn't have to be equal,
[02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:49.660]   however one wants to define equal, but it has to be mutual.
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:52.660]   Like you're feeling goodness from the relationship.
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:54.020]   So is the other person.
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:58.540]   Okay, that's coming from that high generative place.
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:01.460]   And when we really, let's say we push that concept forward
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:05.080]   to where we wanna be living, not some pie in the sky, right?
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:07.420]   But agency and gratitude as verbs.
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:10.980]   The generative drive is very strongly expressed
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:13.980]   and the other drives are subservient to generative drive.
[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:16.720]   Then we get to the place where we really see
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:21.080]   it is true that it is better to give than to receive.
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:25.600]   The happiest people I see are the people who are giving.
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:29.160]   Now, of course it feels great to receive, right?
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:30.920]   But it feels better to give
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:33.860]   because there's a goodness in the self, in the giving.
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:35.940]   And I remember seeing this as a child
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:37.440]   and being too young to understand it.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:40.160]   But as a little kid, I liked getting things, right?
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:41.760]   And as a little kid, I liked getting things
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:42.740]   more than I liked giving.
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:44.480]   Like that's okay when you're a little kid.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:47.160]   But what I did observe is that my maternal grandmother
[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:50.080]   who is very sweet and loving and caring,
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:52.340]   she loved giving, right?
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:53.680]   You give her presence and we did.
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:55.920]   And she really liked getting presents.
[02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:57.420]   She loved giving, right?
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:07:58.780]   There was an excess of goodness.
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.700]   And then as I got older and I learned more
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:02.260]   like who she had been in the community
[02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:05.380]   and how she had been to people and I could see.
[02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:09.740]   And now through the lens that there was such goodness in her
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:12.800]   I think she's, for me, she's the shining model of goodness
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:15.740]   that I internalize as I aspire to be better.
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:18.140]   So then I think I want to be like that.
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:21.000]   I am more generative as I try and think more
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.760]   about giving than receiving.
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:25.140]   It's not, I'm not trying to say I'm some noble person
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:26.220]   or I'm being ascetic.
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:29.300]   I'm thinking that's a good way for us all to feel, right?
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:33.540]   Or someone, a very, very successful person
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.540]   that I consult with is in my life, right?
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:41.540]   Who talked about how he always makes inside of himself
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:43.420]   the best understanding of what's going on
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:44.860]   between him and another person,
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:46.940]   whether it's a very big financial deal
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:49.020]   or it's about power or it's personal
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:51.240]   and then gives a little bit, always.
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.780]   Where have we ended up?
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:54.380]   Let me give a little bit, right?
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:56.460]   And there's a person who's very, very successful,
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:58.020]   very, very happy, right?
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:02.160]   But I would argue the goodness in him
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.360]   is why he's successful and happy.
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.620]   It's not that he's successful and therefore he's happy,
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:08.260]   right, it's what's inside of him
[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:10.420]   that fosters both of those good things.
[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:12.840]   And he could be just as happy without the big success.
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:15.860]   Maybe he wouldn't, maybe he wasn't minded to do that.
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:17.480]   And he grows a nice garden.
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:18.840]   Like he could be equally happy,
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.200]   but the point is the goodness in self
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:24.540]   to be able to do that, right?
[02:09:24.540 --> 02:09:26.120]   To feel good about doing that.
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:28.180]   I feel better about giving that
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.040]   than I would have receiving that.
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.620]   That's pretty stark, right?
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:32.680]   It's something given to the other
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.320]   that I would have gotten right now.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.220]   And we're in maybe a negotiation.
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:39.060]   To give it feels better than to have it.
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:41.960]   - I'm sure there are many people thinking about individuals
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:45.080]   who are highly successful, who are not givers,
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:47.040]   who are takers.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.720]   I do think those examples of takers as I'm calling them
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:53.080]   grab a lot of attention.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.240]   But I know at least within science
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:58.080]   and the other domains of life I've been in
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:01.980]   that there are far more successful people
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:05.760]   who are also givers, even to a great extent.
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.400]   And of course that doesn't mean that they're giving
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:10.260]   to the point of an inability to give further
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.960]   or to take care of themselves.
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:14.380]   The giving is part of taking care of themselves,
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:17.280]   but it's part of this generative cycle.
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:19.780]   It's not one thing, it's not a tit for tat.
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:22.500]   It's part of something that makes them feel good,
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:23.820]   makes others feel good.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:27.300]   It's sort of anti-transactional.
[02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:28.860]   And as we're talking about the self
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:31.200]   and interrelations between selves
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:33.860]   in these different relationship contexts today,
[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:37.840]   this word transactional keeps coming to mind.
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:42.180]   And what I'm so aware of as you're describing
[02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:45.820]   what healthy selves and healthy relationships look like
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:48.920]   is that it runs counter to pretty much everything
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:51.080]   that I've heard and that we hear in the world
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:53.560]   about relationships and about the relationship to self,
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:56.460]   meaning it's not transactional.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:58.780]   It's really about a cycle.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:01.160]   And we're using this word generative over and over
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:03.700]   in its specific context today.
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:07.260]   So I don't want to rob that word for a different purpose,
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:10.820]   but I'm imagining a sort of upward spiral in my mind
[02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:14.760]   or perhaps something that's really like a circle of life
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:17.420]   that just keeps growing bigger and bigger and bigger.
[02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:20.220]   Maybe we could talk a little bit about this notion
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:22.780]   of relationships being transactional.
[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:24.340]   I mean, it's such a loaded word,
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:27.540]   but I have a close friend who's married
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:30.340]   with more than a few children
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:32.760]   who told me the other day,
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.320]   I realized that it's all kind of transactional,
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.400]   like they're extracting from me
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.600]   and I'm extracting from them
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:41.280]   and it's benevolent 'cause it's all good.
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:45.560]   And I thought, wow, this is really dreadful.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:47.760]   No one wants to think that the closest relationships
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:50.400]   in their lives are transactional.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:51.840]   And he was coming to that conclusion.
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.420]   I disagreed with him and I don't know
[02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:54.940]   where that all sits for him right now,
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:58.000]   but maybe we could talk about the transactional
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.700]   versus non-transactional aspects of relationship
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:04.080]   because we all want things.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.560]   That's perfectly healthy, I believe.
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:10.300]   We all experienced disappointment and pleasure and relief
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:13.560]   and sometimes major disappointment, pleasure, relief, et cetera.
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:18.040]   But what is the role of transaction in relationships?
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:19.920]   And how does psychiatry, how do you
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.680]   and how should we think about that?
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:27.180]   - We often get confused because there are transactions
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:30.800]   in every relationship, but that does not mean
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:33.720]   that every relationship is transactional, right?
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.360]   So if we think about what transactions are,
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:39.160]   we can think of like kind of the stereotypical way.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:41.840]   So it can also be like, here's the transaction.
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:43.680]   I'll do the dishes and you wash the clothes.
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.040]   - Right, or for instance, I'll make the money
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:48.480]   and the other person will raise the children.
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:49.320]   - Right, right.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:51.960]   So there are transactions, right?
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:55.520]   But that does not mean that the be all and end all of it
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:59.100]   are sort of hard-hearted calculated transactions.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:02.140]   And transactions also occur in less obvious
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:04.360]   but equally important ways, right?
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:07.540]   So another way that transactions occur is,
[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:10.060]   so right now I'm putting something out there, right?
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:11.540]   'Cause I'm saying something, right?
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:14.040]   And then at a point I stop and I'm waiting for you
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:15.120]   to put something out there.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:17.800]   And then I take in what you said and we're doing something
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:20.160]   that in that sense is transactional.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.520]   I'm waiting for you to give me something.
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:22.840]   I take it in, I process it,
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:24.960]   I give something back out to you.
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:28.960]   But that's not the be all and end all of it.
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.440]   So there are transactions, whether it's the,
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:34.420]   who's gonna wash the dishes, who's gonna do the clothes,
[02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:36.740]   or it's what do I put out there that you take in
[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:39.260]   and what do you put out there that I take in,
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:41.720]   that there is something greater than,
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:44.080]   something beyond the transactional.
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:46.000]   And there is some controversy to this,
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.860]   a thought that there really are a historical thought
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:53.120]   in the field that there are just aggressive
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:55.280]   and pleasure drives in us
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:57.840]   and that everything is transactional.
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:01.380]   Now, again, we don't really have a way of disproving that.
[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:02.920]   I mean, there's not gonna be some equation
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:04.620]   that disproves that,
[02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:08.740]   but I think it's entirely disproven by human experience.
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:12.320]   And there's so many, I mean, I could,
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:15.060]   we could talk about an infinite number of resources
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:15.900]   to consider this,
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:18.280]   but just imagine the writings of Viktor Frankl
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:22.260]   and the writings and the theories around human interactions
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:25.320]   and psychological theories that have come of it.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:28.280]   To think that everything is just transactional,
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.820]   it's a denial of the humanness in all of us
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:33.460]   that I think he just brought to the fore so strongly.
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:36.160]   But again, there could be nearly infinite,
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:38.920]   infinite resources throughout human history that say,
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:40.760]   hey, we're not entirely transactional.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:43.920]   It's not just aggression and pleasure,
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:47.120]   but there's something more going on here.
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:50.080]   There's learning that feels good for the sake of learning.
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:52.960]   There's kindness that feels good for the sake of kindness.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:56.560]   There's giving that feels good because giving feels good.
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:58.100]   Like this is going on in us.
[02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:00.940]   It's going on when we're like loving children, for example,
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:02.240]   or loving animals.
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:03.720]   There's something inside of us
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:06.760]   that's not just transactional.
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:11.160]   And that's why, like, I think what we're talking about is,
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:13.760]   if it's truth, it should all hang together, right?
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:15.040]   It must all hang together.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:18.380]   And this is why there's an us, right,
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:22.100]   over top of each individual that's in a relationship, right?
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:24.700]   This is why you can know everything about me,
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:25.980]   you can know everything about you,
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:28.020]   and you can know nothing about our friendship, right?
[02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:29.540]   Absolutely nothing, right?
[02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:31.700]   Because it's something different, right?
[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:33.660]   And if it were all just transactional,
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:35.480]   there would be nothing different, right?
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:38.740]   And I think our experience as human beings, right?
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:41.820]   I know that to be true because I just know
[02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:44.980]   that I don't always feel selfish about things, right?
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:47.000]   Like maybe sometimes I do and I do something nice
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:47.960]   'cause it'll make me look good.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:49.680]   Like, okay, we're all human, right?
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:53.040]   But I know that there's good feeling
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:54.960]   from others towards me at times.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:56.600]   It's just about the good feeling.
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:15:59.440]   I know that there's that from me towards others.
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:01.260]   So that tells us, yes,
[02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:03.860]   there is something other than just the I.
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:07.680]   There is the we of dyads, right, of relationships,
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.140]   no matter whether they're work,
[02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:11.200]   family, friendship, relationship.
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:13.200]   And then there are the levels beyond that
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.440]   that are larger we's, right?
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:17.340]   The we of groups.
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:20.900]   - So if I understand correctly,
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:24.580]   it can be the case that one person makes the majority
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:26.080]   or all of the income for a family,
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:27.980]   the other person raises the children,
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:30.020]   takes care of the majority of the home.
[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:33.460]   And of course there is a transaction there,
[02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:34.980]   a set of transactions,
[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:37.180]   but that it's in service to something larger
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:39.060]   that really isn't transactional.
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:41.220]   I'm just stealing your words here.
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:44.440]   But if I were to expand on that,
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.220]   just to make sure I understand,
[02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:49.420]   that the non-transactional thing that emerges from that
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:53.340]   is generative because it's a family, right?
[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:55.740]   It's a family that everyone can extract
[02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:58.140]   growth and pleasure and meaning from.
[02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:01.600]   And just because the roles are divided as such,
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:03.780]   it doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.940]   is defined as transactional
[02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:09.280]   in the sense that it's less than it could be.
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:10.740]   - Right, right, right.
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:13.060]   If you think about what's really being transacted.
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:15.380]   So let's say one person is out in the world
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:16.740]   and is making an income.
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:19.020]   The other person is taking care of the family
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:20.260]   and taking care of the home.
[02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:21.460]   What's being transacted?
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:23.740]   Well, the person who's making the money
[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:25.420]   is sharing the money, right?
[02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:27.760]   Is in that sense transacting some of the money
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.600]   to the other person.
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:29.900]   Like you get to have some of it too.
[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:31.300]   You get to have some of the benefit from it.
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:33.380]   And the person who is at home,
[02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:35.540]   who's taking care of the family in the home,
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.900]   saying you get to have some of that too, right?
[02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:40.500]   You get to come, the children are taken care of, right?
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:41.340]   The home is taken care of.
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:44.660]   So both are transacting something to the other, right?
[02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:46.740]   I mean, that's truth of it, right?
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:48.620]   If you look at what's really going on there,
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:50.820]   one person's getting benefit of money they didn't earn.
[02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:51.900]   The other person's getting benefits.
[02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:54.740]   They have childcare they didn't do or pay for, right?
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:56.360]   They're not paying for childcare.
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.460]   They're sharing resources, right?
[02:17:58.460 --> 02:18:02.160]   So yes, that's true, but is that it?
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:04.520]   I mean, are these two robots, right?
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:05.780]   One is the money-making robot
[02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:07.420]   and the other is the childcare robot.
[02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:09.940]   Like that's not what's going on, right?
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:11.500]   The way we want to envision that
[02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:13.940]   if we have two healthy people with generative drives
[02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:15.740]   is they love one another.
[02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:17.340]   They're creating something better
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:18.660]   than they could create on their own.
[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:20.900]   In fact, they've created children, right?
[02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:22.740]   They've created a home together
[02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:25.140]   and they're nurturing that family together
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:26.820]   that is generative.
[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:29.960]   And because it's generative, it can also be flexible.
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:32.520]   So let's say the person who's at home says,
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.260]   I need to do some things outside of the house, right?
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:37.660]   Or let's say the person who's out working thinks,
[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:40.160]   oh, I feel overwhelmed and I like to switch to a better job,
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:41.420]   but that job's half time.
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:44.100]   I could be half in the house, right?
[02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:46.580]   Like this is where people can come together, right?
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:48.860]   In the same way we talked about the two and an eight
[02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:51.380]   on the sex drive or sexuality scale
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:54.060]   where people then can find compromises, right?
[02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:56.740]   And if one really wants to stay out of the home all the time
[02:18:56.740 --> 02:18:58.980]   but the person in the home wants to leave the home,
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:01.380]   well, they find a way that that works, right?
[02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:03.020]   Because they care for one another.
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:06.320]   The generative spirit that is in them individually
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:09.400]   and as a couple lets them nurture that.
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:11.800]   And one isn't interested in oppressing the other.
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:13.440]   I'm not gonna leave my job, you stay at home
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:15.480]   or I'm staying at home, you stay out there.
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.060]   It's like, okay, let's think about things.
[02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:18.560]   Let's communicate, right?
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:20.400]   That's how the generative drive
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:23.100]   not only like makes that awesome, right?
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:24.760]   Like the five isn't the compromised position
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:27.160]   between the eight and the two, the five is awesome, right?
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:29.680]   Here, the transactional aspects are awesome
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.200]   because of the generative aspects of what comes of it
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.960]   far more than either of those people could make on their own.
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:39.240]   I mean, home would say, it's not so obvious.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:41.440]   Maybe if one makes X amount of dollars,
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:43.000]   each could make half X.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.060]   That's not what we're talking about.
[02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:46.660]   Neither of them can create that family on their own.
[02:19:46.660 --> 02:19:50.580]   - It seems that so much of what we're talking about
[02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:54.520]   relies on the hallmarks that we always hear
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:57.420]   make up good relationships of all kinds,
[02:19:57.420 --> 02:19:58.880]   romantic and otherwise.
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:03.200]   Like things like communication, listening, generosity,
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:05.380]   all the stuff that we all know
[02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:06.840]   that we should bring to relationship
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:09.280]   and hopefully are getting from relationships.
[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:10.240]   And that if we're not,
[02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:12.920]   that we should probably request from others
[02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:15.080]   in polite ways.
[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:20.640]   - I have one word for that, kindergarten, right?
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:21.600]   Think about that.
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:23.320]   We learned that in kindergarten.
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:25.840]   What you're describing is so simple, right?
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:28.320]   That's why it's so high up on the,
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:29.720]   this is what the geyser is pushing up.
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.440]   It's high up from the two pillars, right?
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:34.480]   Because what you're talking about is simple,
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:35.640]   generosity of spirit,
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:37.420]   giving rather than taking, right?
[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:39.340]   Being kind to others, letting things go,
[02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:42.020]   feeling good about yourself, even if you fall down, right?
[02:20:42.020 --> 02:20:43.680]   We learned this in kindergarten.
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:46.680]   So we must somewhere inside of us really value it, right?
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:48.000]   But then we let it go.
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000]   We make things overly complex.
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.880]   And this idea that in many ways
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:56.480]   we should go back to kindergarten, right?
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:58.600]   Because there's a purity there, right?
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:01.020]   Children in an age where they can learn
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:03.280]   and then we bring a nice kind of learning to them
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:04.400]   and a nurturing to them.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:06.760]   And we can bring it to ourselves too,
[02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:10.440]   so that we simplify that which has become overly complex.
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:13.180]   Right, we simplify because trauma makes complexity.
[02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:16.840]   Having to just make one's way in the world is complicated.
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:18.680]   Right, so things get more and more complicated
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:21.740]   and we lose the simple roots of goodness
[02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:24.680]   or the goodness of simplicity, right?
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:26.360]   And we can come back to that.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:27.940]   So I couldn't resist when he said,
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:30.760]   oh, these are kind of simple, these basic things, right?
[02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:32.340]   Like, right, that's the point of it
[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:34.340]   because that's where agency and gratitude
[02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:35.180]   and the generative drive,
[02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:37.720]   that's where they live in the simplicity.
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:39.560]   - I'm glad you mentioned kindergarten.
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:43.100]   It brought me back to images of kindergarten
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:45.360]   where, yeah, as far as I can remember now,
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:46.780]   there were all the critical components
[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:48.440]   of a great generative environment.
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:50.280]   You know, adults who really cared about us.
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:53.260]   Fortunately, there were snack time with oranges,
[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:54.880]   so nourishing food.
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.520]   There was nap time in the afternoon.
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:57.360]   Like these things are all things that I think-
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.160]   - You got some exercise, explore.
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:01.520]   - Yeah, you can take a guinea pig home on the weekends.
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:02.580]   Do they have this guinea pig?
[02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:04.880]   I think they actually, I think there were several guinea pigs
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:05.960]   but they kept trying to convince us
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:07.720]   it was the same guinea pig
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:09.880]   because they would allow one family
[02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:11.840]   to take home the guinea pig each weekend.
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:13.920]   And sometimes I think it didn't work out quite so well.
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:16.840]   But anyway, the guinea pig was a pervasive feature.
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:18.280]   So you learn to take care of things.
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:21.160]   And in all seriousness, now that I stepped back from it,
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:23.600]   there's nothing more generative, it seems,
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:25.960]   than a kindergarten classroom environment,
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:26.900]   or we should say a healthy
[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:28.400]   kindergarten classroom environment.
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:30.960]   It's all about support of others.
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:33.800]   And if we go to the pillars,
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:35.740]   the structure of self and the function of self,
[02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:37.820]   I mean, surely there's a lot going on at home too,
[02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:39.860]   but think about like what's salient.
[02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:42.680]   It's learning messages of self,
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:46.420]   self-confidence, like instilling those.
[02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:49.860]   It's behaviors that are based on strivings and hopefulness.
[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:53.060]   Like it's all the good things, all the good things.
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:57.620]   And so, as I was thinking about communication
[02:22:57.620 --> 02:22:59.700]   and all these good things that clearly,
[02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:01.460]   kindergarten is a wonderful template for,
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:04.020]   in all seriousness, I think is an amazing template.
[02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:07.420]   I'm thinking about what gets in the way.
[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:10.720]   And of course, trauma can get in the way.
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:12.960]   And we should talk about that more.
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:14.820]   But it seems to me that one of the things
[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:17.580]   that gets in the way of asking for what we want,
[02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:20.020]   of hearing requests of us in the way
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:23.660]   that is going to bring about the most generative goodness
[02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:25.220]   is anxiety.
[02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:27.460]   It's like, you're tired from a long day.
[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:30.600]   And someone mentions like, we have to take the trash out.
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:32.300]   You're like, ah, like I was at work all day.
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:35.300]   Like, you know, that kind of thing.
[02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:39.860]   Or earlier talking about the issue of the non-issue
[02:23:39.860 --> 02:23:42.620]   in terms of power dynamics, you know, that,
[02:23:42.620 --> 02:23:45.700]   well, let's just say I've had the experience before
[02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:49.280]   in relationship of feeling like if I make a request
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:52.240]   or I have a quote unquote complaint about something,
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:54.240]   that the other person is going to be so upset
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:57.140]   about the fact that they didn't do something well,
[02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:59.140]   that it's gonna be three days
[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:02.100]   of just like diminished happiness for everybody.
[02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:05.340]   So I just assume, like not deal with it, right?
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:06.700]   So when we hear the word anxiety,
[02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:09.220]   I think we often think about the person like quaking about,
[02:24:09.220 --> 02:24:12.580]   you know, public speaking or like getting the circuits
[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:14.500]   in their brain hijacked that were only designed
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:15.640]   for saber-toothed tigers.
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:18.340]   But you know, anxiety seems to serve both
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:21.180]   a very important functional role in modern life
[02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:24.020]   that has nothing to do with physical threat.
[02:24:24.020 --> 02:24:26.400]   But it also seems to be the feature
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:27.780]   that if not kept in check,
[02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:30.580]   if we can't regulate our own anxiety,
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:33.300]   I'm realizing there's no way that we're going to be
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:36.500]   in a position to ask for what we need and what we want,
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:39.820]   to hear what's needed of us and what others want.
[02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:44.080]   In other words, anxiety seems like a major barrier
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:45.320]   to the generative drive.
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:50.040]   - I think the place to start is if you show me a person
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:53.860]   who has no anxiety, I'll show you a mannequin, right?
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:55.700]   We all have anxiety in us.
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:57.420]   Remember, it's just a word, right?
[02:24:57.420 --> 02:24:58.580]   What are we getting at?
[02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:00.540]   We're getting at a sense of tension, right?
[02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:04.920]   Or a sense of disquiet inside of us
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:07.140]   that we would like to solve,
[02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:09.460]   we would like to ease if we could.
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:12.580]   It is not helpful or healthy if we have very,
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:15.300]   very low levels of that, right?
[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:17.980]   Because then our strivings are certainly gonna suffer,
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:20.020]   right, there's not a lot of motivation, right?
[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:24.180]   To go make change in the world, change in our lives, right?
[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:26.980]   So if we have too little of that tension,
[02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:28.420]   that doesn't go well.
[02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:33.420]   And that maps to a low assertiveness, right?
[02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:36.300]   Aggression, proactive drive,
[02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:38.160]   there are other ways that could show itself,
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.820]   but it maps very clearly, I think, to that.
[02:25:40.820 --> 02:25:43.040]   And that's not good for us.
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:44.540]   On the other end of the spectrum,
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:45.540]   we're much more concerned
[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:46.700]   with the other end of the spectrum
[02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:49.060]   because a lot of anxiety feels very, very bad
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:51.320]   and it feels very bad right now, right?
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:54.080]   So our high levels of anxiety,
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:56.280]   they narrow our cognitive spectrum,
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:00.140]   they narrow our ability to think about what's going on
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:02.340]   around us, to think about ourselves.
[02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:06.220]   So the idea with anxiety is to recognize,
[02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:08.940]   hey, we all have it and we can call it anxiety,
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:11.700]   we can call it tension, we can call it whatever we want to,
[02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:15.740]   but we want that to be in a healthy place, right?
[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:18.700]   Which comes, of course, back to the self,
[02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:22.740]   that if my levels of anxiety are very high
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:25.540]   and therefore it's causing problems in my relationship,
[02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:29.940]   like maybe I'm always asking my partner if we're okay,
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:30.860]   right, that happens a lot.
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:31.700]   Like, are we okay?
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:32.540]   Are you happy?
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:34.380]   Right, because there's a lot of anxiety in me.
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:37.320]   Like the first place to go is to look at myself
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:40.100]   so we could say, oh, I have attachment insecurity.
[02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:41.800]   That's just stating the obvious, right?
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.320]   - Or, sorry, Jindra, but a very common one nowadays
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.460]   that I think is new in the course of human history
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:51.360]   is the tugging the line phenomenon.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:53.440]   You text somebody, 'cause you're thinking about them,
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:57.280]   you don't hear back, and then attention starts to mount.
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:59.440]   And then depending on the context,
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:02.280]   you may either be concerned about the person
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:04.380]   or even suspicious about what the person is up to.
[02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:06.520]   I mean, here, it's very contextual, right?
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.580]   And it depends on the history of both individuals
[02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:10.080]   and that relationship.
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.940]   But then the person will reach back eventually
[02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:16.140]   and it either will bring relief or relief with some resent.
[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:17.180]   Like, where were you?
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:18.020]   What happened?
[02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:20.740]   This is very, very common.
[02:27:21.540 --> 02:27:24.780]   So much so, in fact, that I've come to learn
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:27.140]   in talking to others, and this is the classic,
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:29.980]   I have a friend who, but really others who are
[02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:32.200]   in the landscape of looking for a relationship.
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:36.020]   And there are people I know well who go through
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:41.020]   a lot of effort to set an intermittent schedule of response,
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:43.100]   like to not give the other person the sense
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:45.100]   that they always respond with short latency,
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:47.980]   because indeed, sometimes they will be able to do that
[02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:48.820]   and sometimes they won't.
[02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:50.300]   What they're basically trying to do is make sure
[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:52.120]   that the person doesn't, they're actually trying
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:55.120]   to take care of the other person in addition to themselves,
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:57.320]   because I think we come to expect a certain latency
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:58.820]   of response with certain individuals.
[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:01.600]   And if we don't hear back with that particular latency
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:04.680]   of response, our own anxiety starts to pick up
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:06.760]   and it can be quite damaging to a relationship,
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:09.820]   in particular, to the generative drives within us.
[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:11.660]   Because in that time that we're stressed,
[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:13.060]   we're not tending to other things,
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:14.960]   including things that we could do for the relationship
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:15.800]   that we're so worried about.
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:17.740]   - So the famous scene in "Swingers," right?
[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:19.300]   Where the person leaves a message
[02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:22.180]   and then lives the whole relationship in his own mind
[02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:23.260]   and breaks up with the person
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:25.460]   and they never actually spoke, right?
[02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:27.380]   There's the anxiety run wild.
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:29.940]   And of course, I remember that was very,
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:31.260]   very popular when that came out.
[02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:32.100]   Why?
[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:34.160]   'Cause it resonated with the insecurities we feel.
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:37.020]   And now with the ability to feel those insecurities
[02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:38.320]   in a much more immediate way,
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:40.260]   that person didn't text me back, right?
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:42.340]   There's a lot more of that inside of us,
[02:28:42.340 --> 02:28:46.400]   which really points to if you're able to identify
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:49.540]   that you're anxious, too anxious for comfort,
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:51.660]   which again, if one looks inside
[02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:54.400]   or even listens maybe to what others have said or reflected,
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:56.540]   there's a lot of data, especially introspection,
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:58.520]   to be able to identify that, right?
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:01.440]   The next question is always why, right?
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:02.560]   Let's go look at that.
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:05.140]   Maybe that person has been anxious their whole life, right?
[02:29:05.140 --> 02:29:07.680]   Maybe they just have run tense all the time.
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:09.900]   You know what, sometimes a little bit of medicine
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:11.280]   that kind of just pulls that down,
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.500]   person can take that for 50 years,
[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:14.120]   life is better, there's no side effects.
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:16.540]   So sometimes like that might be the case, right?
[02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:19.080]   Sometimes the person's anxiety kind of grew
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:20.800]   throughout childhood and maybe that's because
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:23.120]   there were difficult things or traumatic things that happened.
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:24.760]   Maybe there was nothing like that,
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:27.640]   but maybe the person was very good at engaging in the world
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:29.680]   and then felt more and more pressures upon themselves
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:30.920]   and no one ever did anything wrong
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:32.640]   and they've only been rewarded, right?
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:35.960]   But regardless, look at the anxiety in yourself,
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:38.080]   go back to those pillars, right?
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.240]   And one might discover, for example,
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:43.080]   maybe the anxiety I'm feeling
[02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:44.920]   is attributable to the other person.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.640]   Am I feeling anxious because I'm intimidated, right?
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:49.600]   Am I feeling anxious because I know
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:51.600]   that if I don't behave in a certain way,
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:53.220]   you know, the next time there's a group meeting,
[02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:56.200]   there'll be some snarky joke made about me.
[02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:58.620]   So anxiety, sometimes it's the self.
[02:29:58.620 --> 02:30:00.800]   Sometimes it's still got a lot of biological components.
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:02.620]   Sometimes it's got a lot of psychological components.
[02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:04.000]   Sometimes both, right?
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.280]   Sometimes it's the environment.
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:06.700]   Sometimes it's the other, right?
[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:07.540]   The other person.
[02:30:07.540 --> 02:30:11.780]   So look at why, because that's how we learn, right?
[02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:13.240]   Like what is going on inside of me?
[02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:14.920]   Where is that level of anxiety?
[02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:16.400]   How does it not feel comfortable?
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:17.540]   Like what actually is it?
[02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:18.980]   How is it changing?
[02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:19.820]   How I'm behaving?
[02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:21.120]   How might it be changing?
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:22.780]   How am I responding to it?
[02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:23.940]   So what are we doing?
[02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:27.860]   We're going back to this look in those 10 cabinets
[02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:31.140]   and figure out why, which we can do, right?
[02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:33.400]   The vast majority of times between ourselves
[02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:34.240]   and the use of others,
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:36.300]   either professionally or non-professionally,
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:40.380]   we can go understand the anxiety or the lack of anxiety.
[02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:42.700]   Why am I not so motivated, right?
[02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.100]   I mean, that's a case with a lot of people
[02:30:44.100 --> 02:30:45.180]   who feel demoralized.
[02:30:45.180 --> 02:30:47.400]   They don't feel they can get anywhere in the world, right?
[02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:48.420]   The world's a bad place.
[02:30:48.420 --> 02:30:50.420]   And how are you gonna make your way in the world?
[02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:51.780]   And they start feeling nihilistic
[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:55.320]   or they feel like the eight ball is against them,
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:57.140]   even in a generational capacity, right?
[02:30:57.140 --> 02:30:58.760]   And now they feel demoralized
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:02.460]   and the tension inside is soothed by things.
[02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:04.340]   So maybe that's the person who's overusing
[02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:06.100]   the thing that soothes, right?
[02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:07.620]   So they could go look at,
[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:09.160]   hey, like I always kind of motivated
[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.960]   and did well in sports or the well in this,
[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:12.840]   was interested in that, right?
[02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:13.680]   What's going on?
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:14.920]   That's how a person could identify,
[02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:16.580]   for example, being demoralized.
[02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:20.480]   So that process of inquiry gives us the information
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:23.020]   that we can use in the service of change.
[02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:26.180]   And the change, while not achieved 100% of the time,
[02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:28.440]   the change for the better is predictable
[02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:31.360]   if it's arising from a place of understanding.
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:35.400]   - I'm very curious about frames of mind in relationship,
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:38.660]   in particular, how being in our own experience,
[02:31:38.660 --> 02:31:42.280]   let's say anxious because someone hasn't responded to us
[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:44.700]   and really paying attention to the anxiety
[02:31:44.700 --> 02:31:47.240]   and drilling into it and asking ourselves,
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:50.400]   why am I anxious and do I deserve to be anxious?
[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:51.240]   Is it about me?
[02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:52.880]   Is it about them?
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:55.600]   Whether or not that's a valid pursuit
[02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:58.880]   or whether or not focusing on the other person
[02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:02.360]   and trying to imagine like what's going on in their head
[02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:03.480]   that they might be doing this
[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:05.960]   or that they seem to do something repeatedly.
[02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:07.400]   This of course relates to much more
[02:32:07.400 --> 02:32:09.980]   than just the scenario of waiting for a text message
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:11.220]   and feeling anxious.
[02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:14.400]   I mean, I think so much of how we come into relationships
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:17.040]   of all kinds, romantic certainly,
[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:21.940]   but family relationships are in and around the tendency
[02:32:21.940 --> 02:32:23.880]   to switch back and forth.
[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:26.800]   Sometimes seemingly at random between our own experience
[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:27.680]   and what am I feeling?
[02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:29.080]   What am I experiencing?
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:30.440]   And then thinking about the other,
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:32.340]   like what are they thinking?
[02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:33.320]   What are they experiencing?
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:37.180]   I mean, this is everything to do with human dynamics, right?
[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:39.720]   I would think that it's near impossible
[02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:43.000]   for the typical person to just live life
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.440]   through their own frame and lens
[02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:46.940]   and never pay attention at all
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:48.040]   to what others might be thinking.
[02:32:48.040 --> 02:32:50.040]   Even for instance, the most exploitive,
[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:55.040]   extractive narcissist sociopath presumably is thinking about
[02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:57.200]   you know, who in the room is going to be their target
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:32:59.480]   because of how that person might be feeling.
[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:00.880]   And of course, on the benevolent side,
[02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:04.680]   people who want to do positive generative things
[02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:06.860]   in the world are probably thinking about, you know,
[02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:08.360]   who to align with,
[02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:10.940]   who has common goals that they might want to work with
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:13.480]   or be with romantically that could help them
[02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:15.840]   and the other person generate.
[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:19.760]   So what is this thing that we do, you know,
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:22.760]   what is it called and how does it work
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:25.120]   to place ourselves in the mind of others
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:26.720]   and what roles does it serve
[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:29.820]   and what goals does it undercut when we do this?
[02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:32.060]   - Well, so I think the first thing to say
[02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:35.920]   is that everything follows the same simple pattern, right?
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:39.880]   So I start with thinking about me, right?
[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:42.460]   If I'm anxious, why am I anxious?
[02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:43.900]   What's going on inside of me?
[02:33:43.900 --> 02:33:46.520]   Then I think about you, are you anxious too?
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:49.500]   Or maybe I'm not anxious but I notice that you are, right?
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:51.460]   So there's the thought about the I
[02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:54.280]   because I can't think in a clear-headed way about you
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:56.320]   unless I've thought about me, right?
[02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:58.120]   'Cause if I'm really, really, really anxious,
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:00.220]   then how am I supposed to understand
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:02.640]   and try and get an idea of where you're at, right?
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:04.240]   So then where do we arrive?
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:08.180]   We arrive at the magic bridge of the us, right?
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:11.820]   That's what connects us, whether the us is a friendship,
[02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:15.720]   it's a professional relationship, it's romance, right?
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:17.000]   There's the bridge of the us
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:20.600]   because it's not just how or when am I anxious?
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:22.960]   How or when are you anxious?
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:25.400]   What are things like when we're together, right?
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:27.800]   Maybe I'm anxious when we're together
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.480]   and what's that tension about it?
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.600]   You're anxious when we're together
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:33.040]   and maybe that's for reasons we could talk about
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.960]   and make less, maybe there's some insecurity in one of us
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:38.880]   or maybe the other person is behaving in a certain way
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:41.720]   that's not making the second person feel good, right?
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:43.520]   We can then come together and see
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:47.120]   how does the us impact the level of anxiety
[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:50.880]   and how do we then take away from the us being stronger?
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:53.200]   So think about, we talked about the trauma bond.
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:56.200]   Trauma bond can be enacted in a negative way.
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:58.040]   It can be enacted in a positive way.
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.120]   And those two people who can go to the museum together,
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:04.160]   who can't go to the museum separately, right?
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:07.220]   They're living in the magic bridge of the us, right?
[02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:08.600]   They're both at the museum,
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:10.740]   but neither can go to the museum, right?
[02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:12.120]   Neither can go to the museum,
[02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:14.440]   but both can go to the museum.
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:18.200]   And then they take away stronger selves from that, right?
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:21.400]   That's a reinforcing experience, it's positive, right?
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:24.080]   It builds the generative drive, it builds confidence, right?
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:25.780]   The person went, they were assertive
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.360]   and that was gratified in a good way
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:28.840]   and they felt pleasure, right?
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:32.480]   So when we look at the us, it is about the us in the moment,
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:34.980]   right, but it is also about how two people
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:37.560]   are impacting one another in the rest of their lives.
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:39.680]   And this, of course, this is more important
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:42.440]   the closer the relationship, like this is very important,
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:45.520]   for example, in close friendships or family relationships.
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:49.440]   And I think this is of extreme importance in relationships.
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:51.600]   Right, these are the two people who presumably
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:54.100]   are the closest to one another on earth.
[02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:58.360]   So a shared us that promotes understanding
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:02.160]   and bolsters a sense of agency and gratitude
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:04.280]   and bolsters the generative drive,
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.080]   like that's great for both people when they're not in the us,
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:10.040]   when one goes one way and one goes the other,
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:12.040]   because that happens all the time in relationships too,
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:13.840]   right, you go to work at different places,
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:17.960]   or we bolster ourselves outside of relationships
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:21.900]   if we see what the magic bridge of the relationship can be.
[02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:24.000]   So we can look there for problems,
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.800]   like why am I anxious, why are you anxious,
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:26.880]   why are we anxious?
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:29.140]   Why are you only anxious when we're we and not?
[02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:31.780]   We can look over all that and we should, right?
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:34.360]   But we can also even more powerfully
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:36.840]   look for the good there, right?
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:39.640]   How can our shared bond, whatever it may be,
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:40.900]   be better for both of us?
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:43.720]   And what stronger incentive could there be
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:46.480]   than to do that in relationships, right?
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:48.640]   Romantic relationships are the ones that are closest to us.
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:50.160]   If they're not romantic, they could be friendships.
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:52.420]   Whatever our closest relationships are,
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:55.300]   they're the most important vehicles, so to speak,
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:57.860]   to better health and happiness, to getting to that place
[02:36:57.860 --> 02:37:02.600]   of peace and contentment and delight, right?
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:04.780]   The us is very, very powerful.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:08.080]   In fact, even more powerful than the I and the you.
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:14.180]   - When thinking about the us and trying to understand
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:18.460]   why somebody that we know and are in relationship with
[02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:21.680]   is behaving the way they are or might be feeling
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:23.980]   or claiming they feel the way that they are,
[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:25.880]   how useful do you think it is for us
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:28.320]   to put ourselves in their shoes?
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:31.960]   I can think of all sorts of ways
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:33.380]   in which this could be beneficial.
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.080]   I can also think of all sorts of ways
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:37.920]   in which it would be focusing off the self
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:40.460]   and our own experience in ways
[02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:45.460]   that might be defensive avoidance or denial, right?
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:46.280]   Yeah, I'll come clean.
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:48.060]   I mean, there've been plenty of times in relationship
[02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:52.420]   where I get fixated on why someone is the way they are,
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:54.260]   behaved the way they did.
[02:37:54.260 --> 02:37:57.540]   And more often than not, by taking a step back
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:02.240]   and thinking about why my reaction to that is the way it is,
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:05.580]   I don't solve the quote unquote problem,
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:07.280]   but I get a lot further along
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:09.860]   in terms of quelling my own anxiety
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:11.420]   and finding a path forward.
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:12.900]   - Right, right, right.
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:15.740]   Well, mentalization, which is the ability
[02:38:15.740 --> 02:38:19.300]   to discern feeling states, intention states
[02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:22.340]   in self and others, but now we're looking for others, right?
[02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:25.100]   So the ability to understand feeling states,
[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:27.100]   what's going on inside of you, intention,
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:28.700]   what are your intentions, right?
[02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:31.380]   That should only be good, right?
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:35.480]   Because if we're seeing it through a clear lens,
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:38.740]   meaning a lens that's not biased by some problem,
[02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:41.940]   like a defense mechanism of rationalization, for example,
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:43.220]   or of projection, right?
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:47.180]   If we're seeing clearly, we're learning about the other, right?
[02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:49.300]   And the learning is never bad, right?
[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:51.860]   Knowledge, truth is good.
[02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:54.020]   So if we learn about the other by, in that sense,
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:57.660]   putting ourselves in their shoes, then we gain information,
[02:38:57.660 --> 02:39:01.540]   but it's the health in us that is so crucial
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:03.660]   to what we do with that information, right?
[02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:04.780]   So one person could say,
[02:39:04.780 --> 02:39:08.020]   put themselves in the other person's shoes
[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:10.400]   and they can say, okay, that person I can see,
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:12.580]   that person's responding, and they say pretty calm,
[02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:14.900]   pretty calm about something, right?
[02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:16.540]   And maybe that's just a good thing.
[02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:19.000]   Maybe there's some contention going on
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.060]   and that person's maintaining their cool
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:22.980]   and that person's gonna be really helpful
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:25.340]   in navigating an argument or a disagreement
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:29.340]   to some really positive end point, right?
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:32.380]   So if a person sees clearly, like I see,
[02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:34.280]   okay, I can see that you're calm
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:37.460]   and I also see that you're trying to figure things out
[02:39:37.460 --> 02:39:39.400]   and the things that you're saying are sort of positive,
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:40.460]   you're disagreeing with me,
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:42.840]   but you don't seem to mean ill, right?
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:43.900]   Then I can see, you know what?
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:45.780]   I think your calm is good, right?
[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:48.820]   Because I'm getting a little bit upset and you're not,
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.620]   and I see that there's a benevolence in you.
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:53.540]   So maybe you'll guide us to the place that maybe I can't,
[02:39:53.540 --> 02:39:54.380]   right?
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:59.180]   But think about if there's not a clear lens inside of me,
[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:02.620]   right, if I have a defense system
[02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:05.600]   that leads me to externalize responsibility,
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:06.780]   that leads me to project,
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:09.000]   or leads me to all sorts of things that are not healthy,
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.300]   now I might think, well, you're calm
[02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:13.860]   because you just don't care about me, right?
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:16.400]   I mean, so think about the same exact thing, right?
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:17.660]   Now, in the example we're giving,
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:20.100]   the person in your position is like being really benign
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:23.100]   and benevolent, but it happens all the time
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:25.180]   where that is misconstrued.
[02:40:25.180 --> 02:40:29.740]   So it's not that the insight, that person is calm,
[02:40:29.740 --> 02:40:30.660]   I see that they're calm,
[02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:33.140]   it's that there's a deficit in the mentalization.
[02:40:33.140 --> 02:40:36.780]   The person's not fully understanding their intention, right?
[02:40:36.780 --> 02:40:39.420]   What's coming through then gets distorted, right?
[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:41.220]   So we think about defense mechanisms,
[02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:44.100]   they can be clear, they can let light through
[02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:46.420]   in this beautiful way that has fidelity,
[02:40:46.420 --> 02:40:48.180]   or they can be very distorting.
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:53.180]   So the thought, if I'm discerning that you are benevolent
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:57.500]   and you seem to be trying to solve the problem for us,
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:00.440]   but I take in, and you just don't care about me,
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:03.420]   and you're trying to put one over on me,
[02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:06.320]   if I've assessed it accurately,
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:10.540]   but it comes on the other end in a way that's changed,
[02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:12.260]   that's because there's a lack of clarity,
[02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:15.420]   there's a distortion inside of me, right?
[02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:18.500]   So then if I'm really working on myself,
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:20.240]   I'm in the best place I can be,
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:24.100]   I'm gonna be better at mentalizing about you and me, right?
[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:25.860]   Even if I say, well, we're having a disagreement,
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:27.940]   I know I tend to get a little defensive,
[02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:31.100]   so I'm gonna be a little biased to see what's in you
[02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:32.580]   in a kind of negative way, right?
[02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:33.420]   So what am I seeing?
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:36.240]   Like, okay, you're pretty calm, like maybe you don't care.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:38.820]   Like, I know I can think that, right?
[02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:39.980]   But like, come on, you're trying,
[02:41:39.980 --> 02:41:40.820]   you wanna solve our problem.
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:43.280]   Like I can imagine when that goes on inside of a person,
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:45.080]   which sometimes goes on consciously
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:48.180]   or goes on unconsciously or some mixture,
[02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:50.020]   it's so powerful, right?
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:51.940]   The person's aware of their own state,
[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:54.700]   which helps them to be aware of the state of the other,
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:56.180]   and then the information they're getting
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:57.580]   comes through with fidelity.
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:41:58.620]   And now all of a sudden,
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:00.360]   instead of maybe I'm gonna blow things up,
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:02.260]   now I'm aligned with you in solving our problem
[02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:04.260]   because I see clearly about you and me.
[02:42:04.260 --> 02:42:06.580]   And that's going on all the time.
[02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:07.780]   It might say, well, it's complicated,
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:09.480]   there's a lot of back and forth.
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:11.520]   Right, there are millions of things going on
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:13.560]   every split second in our unconscious mind
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:15.620]   that is throwing all this up to the conscious mind,
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:17.100]   it's doing things rapidly.
[02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:19.360]   That's going on all the time in us,
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:21.380]   whether we want to acknowledge it or not.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:25.160]   And we choose not to acknowledge it at our own peril
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:27.420]   because then we're not going to those two pillars
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:28.740]   and there are 10 cupboards.
[02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:30.520]   We're not going to the structure of self,
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.360]   the function of self and what comprises those two pillars
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:36.800]   to look for, hey, what's going on, right?
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:38.180]   Let me understand better.
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:41.100]   And even if things are going well, right?
[02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:43.060]   We can always, as you said not that long ago,
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:44.920]   we can understand ourselves better.
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:48.340]   The stronger I am, the more generative drive there is in me,
[02:42:48.340 --> 02:42:50.960]   the less defensiveness, the more the agency
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:52.900]   and the gratitude, the more I'm armed
[02:42:52.900 --> 02:42:56.300]   for whatever difficult thing comes my way.
[02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:58.100]   So if there's a conflict with someone,
[02:42:58.100 --> 02:43:00.180]   whether there should be or there shouldn't be,
[02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:01.660]   maybe someone's being really aggressive
[02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:02.780]   and I got to kind of say some things
[02:43:02.780 --> 02:43:04.220]   and try and counter that, right?
[02:43:04.220 --> 02:43:06.620]   I'm going to be able to discern one from another.
[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:08.760]   I'm going to be more effective in both, right?
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:11.380]   I just set myself up for success.
[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:14.180]   And if I'm setting me up for success,
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:16.120]   then I'm also setting you up for success
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:18.020]   if you're someone I have a relationship with,
[02:43:18.020 --> 02:43:19.020]   no matter what it is.
[02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:22.140]   And then ultimately I'm setting the we, right?
[02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:24.220]   The magical bridge of us.
[02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:26.300]   I'm setting that up for success too.
[02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:29.420]   And that's how you see on these levels of emergence that,
[02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:31.300]   you know, if you understand everything about you
[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:32.660]   and understand everything about me,
[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:36.700]   and let's say person understands we have a generative drive,
[02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:38.280]   you don't really know what our relationship
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:39.380]   is going to be like, but you think,
[02:43:39.380 --> 02:43:41.040]   I bet it's going to be a good one, right?
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:43.860]   And then what would we then contribute,
[02:43:43.860 --> 02:43:45.220]   say to a broader culture?
[02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:47.220]   So a group of people, maybe there's 10 people,
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:48.780]   a bunch of friends getting together,
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:51.340]   we would contribute goodness at that next level,
[02:43:51.340 --> 02:43:54.040]   which is then the culture of the larger group.
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:56.060]   - In hearing your description of mentalization,
[02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:59.820]   this ability for all of us to get into the mind of another
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:03.680]   and to try and imagine motivations and states
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:04.940]   that would explain their behavior.
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:05.780]   - And self, right?
[02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:07.180]   - And self. - Mind of self and other.
[02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:10.380]   - Yeah, that seems like a natural reflex that's healthy.
[02:44:10.380 --> 02:44:12.880]   And it seems to surface most often
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:16.300]   as the consequence of negative interactions, right?
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:17.520]   You know, something didn't go right.
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:19.560]   And so we kind of explore like, was it them?
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:20.400]   Was it me?
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:22.420]   Like, was it something that happened before?
[02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:24.540]   You know, what else is going on with this person?
[02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:26.280]   As a way to try and arrive at some sort of,
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:28.120]   hopefully generative understanding.
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:30.360]   But it seems to me that there's also great value
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:34.080]   in mentalizing about others under conditions
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:35.680]   in which things are going well,
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:38.440]   so that one can potentially make things
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:40.640]   or encourage things to go even better
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:41.880]   in future interactions.
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:42.720]   - Right.
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:44.200]   Well, the first thing I would say is,
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:49.200]   I think the reflex is most often not mentalizing.
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.020]   That the reflex is most often not mentalizing, right?
[02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:57.440]   Because the reflexes often come from a position
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:44:59.960]   of not feeling safe, right?
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:00.800]   There's some conflict.
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:02.200]   I don't feel good, right?
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:03.040]   There's some conflict.
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:05.720]   People, you know, we all can get very defensive very quickly
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:07.120]   whether we show it on the outside
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:09.540]   or we start partitioning inside.
[02:45:09.540 --> 02:45:12.760]   And the problems come not from mentalizing,
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:15.080]   but they come from not mentalizing, right?
[02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:16.680]   And not being aware of the difference.
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:17.520]   'Cause then I conclude,
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:20.520]   I know what's going on in you and I don't, right?
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:22.720]   Because I don't know what's going on in me, right?
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:24.720]   And I think you're being aggressive, really.
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:26.040]   I'm feeling kind of defensive.
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:26.880]   I'm feeling vulnerable.
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:29.160]   And then I'm getting aggressive, right?
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:30.380]   But I can't handle that
[02:45:30.380 --> 02:45:31.580]   because I don't wanna be aggressive.
[02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:32.760]   So you're aggressive, right?
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:35.480]   So there's such a difference between, say,
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:37.960]   coming at a self-other conflict
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:40.740]   from the perspective of say, not mentalizing,
[02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:43.320]   the thinking that you are versus mentalizing.
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:46.540]   There's a difference between, is it me?
[02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:48.200]   I know it can't be.
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:49.040]   Is it you?
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:50.680]   It must be, right?
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:52.600]   And that's how a lot of that goes.
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:54.940]   And then of course, what's the data that's gathered?
[02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:56.860]   The data that's gathered supports that.
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:45:59.560]   I mean, I think there's wars I think have happened,
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.040]   you know, based upon this little conflicts in friendships
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.360]   and in relationships.
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:06.000]   The key about mentalizing is that's not what it is.
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000]   Mentalizing, it goes like this.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:09.220]   Is it me?
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:10.120]   Is it you?
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:11.720]   Is it us?
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:13.580]   Let's figure that out.
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:15.260]   Let's figure it out together, right?
[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:17.500]   It's not defensive.
[02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:18.340]   It's not aggressive.
[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:19.180]   It's not projecting.
[02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:22.000]   It's really actually seeing.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.040]   And look, if it's me, I wanna be aware of it and say,
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:27.000]   yeah, like, whoa, I got up on the wrong side of the bed.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:28.720]   Like, look, let me just say, I'm sorry, right?
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:31.040]   Or if I might say, look, I know that you're being aggressive
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:31.880]   and you normally wouldn't be there.
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:33.880]   I'm gonna say, look, let me just get away from this.
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:36.880]   Let the person I care about calm down, come back later.
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:38.220]   You know, or if it's us,
[02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:40.320]   there's really something between us and let's sort it out.
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:44.320]   Like the information that allows the healthy, right?
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:46.440]   The agency and gratitude decisions
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:48.600]   is always there through mentalizing.
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:50.560]   The danger is when we're not mentalizing,
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:52.200]   but we think we are.
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:53.040]   Got it.
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:56.440]   In keeping with thinking about others
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:46:59.860]   and what's going on with them, mentalizing that is,
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:01.680]   and in thinking about what's going on with ourselves
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:03.440]   and the exploration of the cupboards
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:05.840]   under the pillars of structure of self function of self
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:07.920]   and our desire for all of that to geyser up
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:10.060]   into agency and gratitude.
[02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:14.160]   One thing that we hear about so much these days,
[02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:15.540]   and generally I think it's good
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:19.320]   that people are talking about them, are boundaries, right?
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:20.800]   You know, you've crossed my boundary
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:21.960]   or I'm setting a boundary.
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:26.420]   And I've certainly embedded the message in my head
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:28.120]   that in order for certain relationships
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:30.240]   to be at their most loving in my life,
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:32.220]   sometimes the boundaries require
[02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:35.360]   very little frequency of communication.
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:38.100]   But that doesn't mean the relationships aren't ongoing.
[02:47:38.100 --> 02:47:41.440]   So what are your thoughts on boundaries
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:43.540]   and how should we think about boundaries
[02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:45.940]   for sake of healthy relationships?
[02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:49.580]   Well, healthy boundaries always start inside.
[02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:52.140]   And then once we have them squared away inside,
[02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:54.080]   we can project them outward, right?
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:56.200]   The same as everything works, right?
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:59.580]   It starts with the self and then it includes the other.
[02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:02.880]   So let's say you took an example of a friend
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:05.920]   who's just a little too presumptuous, right?
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:08.740]   Like the kind of person you'd rather knock on your door,
[02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:10.220]   but who just opens the door and comes in.
[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:12.080]   Like that kind of thing.
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:13.440]   And you like the person a lot
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:14.540]   and there's a lot of resonance
[02:48:14.540 --> 02:48:16.220]   and you don't want to lose the friendship.
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:18.840]   And then, so let's imagine what could happen here.
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:20.120]   It's not the only thing that can happen,
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:22.000]   but a thought experiment, right?
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.640]   So the person may then question themselves like,
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:26.020]   is there something wrong with me?
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:28.280]   Like, 'cause I don't really like this person
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:29.280]   coming in my front door.
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:30.340]   Like, is that just me?
[02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.620]   Am I being weird about that?
[02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:34.320]   Or the person can kind of stop and think about that
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:35.700]   and they can take stock of self
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:38.560]   and they can arrive at an answer, right, for themselves.
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:41.980]   Like, look, that person may conclude that, you know what?
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:44.160]   People I'm as close to as this person come in my front door,
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:45.560]   you know what, that's okay, right?
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:47.860]   You know what, I don't need to set a boundary there, right?
[02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:49.420]   That's possible, right?
[02:48:49.420 --> 02:48:52.740]   More often what the person concludes is,
[02:48:52.740 --> 02:48:54.180]   no, I don't really want that.
[02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:56.780]   Like I do actually want this person to knock on the door
[02:48:56.780 --> 02:48:58.400]   and that's okay.
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:00.060]   There's not something wrong with me.
[02:49:00.060 --> 02:49:01.460]   It's not that I'm being a jerk.
[02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:03.400]   It's not that I'm being a bad friend, right?
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:04.420]   'Cause what are they saying?
[02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:05.500]   You might say, oh, they're preparing
[02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:06.940]   for what the other person could say.
[02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:08.140]   But no, they're countering
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:11.200]   what they're testing out to themselves.
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:12.240]   Does that mean I'm a bad friend?
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:13.540]   No, right?
[02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:14.420]   That kind of thing.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:16.500]   So they know and then they understand
[02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:19.020]   and then they have the right to set the boundary, right?
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:20.160]   Like, okay, it's my house.
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:21.420]   I try and be generous,
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:22.720]   but I still don't want people coming in the door.
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:25.460]   Like you come to some conclusion
[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:27.060]   that setting the boundary is okay
[02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:29.780]   and you're squared away with it inside.
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:32.380]   Then you communicate the boundary outward, right?
[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:34.580]   And you decide, how do I want to communicate that?
[02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:37.440]   Like saying, hey man, don't come in the front door anymore.
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:39.000]   Like that's not so good, right?
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.900]   Now the friendship is really on the rocks, right?
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:44.420]   But to say to someone something like,
[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:46.940]   yeah, look, I care about you and I trust you
[02:49:46.940 --> 02:49:48.680]   and I know you feel the same way about me,
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:50.660]   but it just makes me nervous.
[02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:51.860]   People just come in the door.
[02:49:51.860 --> 02:49:53.340]   Like, do you mind?
[02:49:53.340 --> 02:49:54.180]   Like, is it okay?
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:49:56.180]   Like if you just please knock on the door.
[02:49:56.180 --> 02:49:57.620]   Now think about how that's been done.
[02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:01.820]   Like it's so accurate, right?
[02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:03.540]   To what's going on inside the person,
[02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:06.980]   to how the person wants to communicate with the other,
[02:50:06.980 --> 02:50:11.100]   then you have the highest likelihood of effectiveness, right?
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:13.140]   And the person also in that sense
[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:15.780]   has sort of the clean conscience, so to speak,
[02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:18.520]   that lets them take in information back.
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:20.760]   So let's say the other person hopefully
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:22.120]   has a high generative drive
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:23.940]   and all the good things we're talking about could say,
[02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:26.580]   oh, you know what, I'm sorry, I didn't,
[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:28.380]   I mean, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
[02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:29.960]   I kind of just automatically do that.
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:32.220]   Or, you know, I always do that at my brother's house
[02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:34.940]   and it's close by or whatever the person is saying.
[02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:35.940]   No worries.
[02:50:35.940 --> 02:50:37.660]   Okay, everything is fine, right?
[02:50:37.660 --> 02:50:40.320]   But let's say that person does get mad, right?
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:41.980]   Now you know, like, whoa,
[02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:43.420]   what's going on in this person, right?
[02:50:43.420 --> 02:50:45.000]   'Cause now what you're doing is you're seeing signs
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.740]   of unhealth in the other person.
[02:50:46.740 --> 02:50:48.200]   And it may be that, whoa,
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:50.000]   that's not so healthy with the person,
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.840]   but I like other aspects of the friendship
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:54.440]   and that seems like kind of a strange idiosyncrasy.
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:56.500]   Then you might decide, you know what,
[02:50:56.500 --> 02:50:57.500]   I want to keep this friendship,
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:50:59.620]   so I'll start locking the door.
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:01.220]   And the person has to knock.
[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:04.100]   Or you might think, okay,
[02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:06.320]   is this, am I seeing something here
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:08.260]   that's about lack of consideration, right?
[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:09.380]   That's about selfishness.
[02:51:09.380 --> 02:51:10.960]   That ultimately may be about envy.
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:13.580]   I'm gonna walk into your house and ruin your privacy.
[02:51:13.580 --> 02:51:15.160]   I'm gonna walk into your house and make you feel anxious.
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:16.440]   I feel entitled to do that.
[02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:17.440]   Like the kind of thing
[02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:19.260]   that's really coming through the lens of envy.
[02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:20.580]   So then you start thinking about that.
[02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:23.420]   And maybe, not always, of course,
[02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:28.420]   sometimes you find a friend who can do the right thing.
[02:51:28.420 --> 02:51:29.780]   Sometimes you find a friend who can't
[02:51:29.780 --> 02:51:31.240]   and you can still make the friendship work.
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:33.900]   Sometimes you find a person who's not a friend, right?
[02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:36.660]   And you see like, oh, that's how everything is
[02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:37.500]   with this person.
[02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:39.420]   You realize like there's no us.
[02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:40.940]   There's no us, right?
[02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:44.820]   And that's how people can leave relationships
[02:51:44.820 --> 02:51:47.000]   that ultimately are exploitive in one way or another,
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.620]   whether it's a friendship, it's a romance.
[02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:51.420]   If a person really understands
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:53.860]   there's the me, the you, the magical bridge of us,
[02:51:53.860 --> 02:51:56.360]   and then wait, there's no magical bridge of us.
[02:51:56.360 --> 02:51:59.300]   I feel that there's a magical bridge of us,
[02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:00.820]   but the other person doesn't.
[02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:03.380]   There's immense power of understanding
[02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:06.980]   and then of appropriate self-care and self-protection.
[02:52:06.980 --> 02:52:11.940]   - Over and over again, not just during today's episode,
[02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:13.820]   but in the previous two episodes,
[02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:17.940]   it seems that getting squared away with oneself
[02:52:17.940 --> 02:52:22.060]   or at least one's own internal processes to some degree,
[02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:24.940]   gaining some insight as to where the negative
[02:52:24.940 --> 02:52:27.720]   or even positive emotion within us is arising
[02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:30.540]   when we're in relationship to anyone or anything,
[02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:32.420]   it just seems so key.
[02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:33.920]   It's like the foundation of it.
[02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:38.920]   You said like getting to the maximum amount of agency
[02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:42.500]   and gratitude is the goal really.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:46.440]   And that's done by cycling back through the cupboards
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:48.760]   that reside under structure of self and function of self
[02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:50.580]   and asking questions about oneself.
[02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:55.580]   And really, unless we are trained psychiatrists like you,
[02:52:55.580 --> 02:52:57.840]   none of us really should be doing that
[02:52:57.840 --> 02:52:59.300]   for the other person, it seems.
[02:52:59.300 --> 02:53:03.340]   This is really each and all of our own responsibility
[02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:05.140]   to do for ourselves,
[02:53:05.140 --> 02:53:08.600]   but that it serves others in so many positive ways.
[02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:09.660]   - Right, right.
[02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:14.260]   So mentalization, Greece is the progress of all things good,
[02:53:14.260 --> 02:53:16.220]   because it is about actual understanding,
[02:53:16.220 --> 02:53:18.820]   feeling states, intentions,
[02:53:18.820 --> 02:53:22.520]   but I have to first mentalize about me
[02:53:22.520 --> 02:53:24.120]   before I mentalize about you.
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:25.760]   A way of putting this would be,
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:28.240]   if I'm thinking about you before I'm thinking about me,
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:30.560]   I'm on a fool's errand, right?
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:32.520]   You have to start with the self
[02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:35.560]   and to try and attain clarity of self
[02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:38.440]   or to realize that you can't, right?
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:41.500]   Like it's a very important nuance.
[02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:43.560]   If I know that say there's trauma in me
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:44.460]   about a certain thing,
[02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:46.600]   and I know that I respond in ways
[02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:49.000]   where sometimes my emotions get high
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:52.240]   and I can't quite think through it all, right?
[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:55.080]   Which can happen to me with references
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:58.440]   or something that's encompassing a certain kind of trauma,
[02:53:58.440 --> 02:54:00.160]   I wanna be aware of that, right?
[02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:02.720]   So this is the idea of not only being aware
[02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:04.560]   of what you know about yourself,
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:06.040]   but being aware that there are things
[02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:07.540]   you don't know about yourself.
[02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:09.880]   So if I know enough to know
[02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:12.160]   that a certain kind of interaction
[02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:14.720]   about a certain kind of trauma really sets me
[02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:18.240]   to a place where I'm not able to mentalize
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:19.720]   like I normally would be, right?
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:21.780]   I'm sort of flying blind, right?
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:23.280]   Then good for me to know that
[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:25.520]   because I don't know what that's doing to me.
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:27.600]   So it's the last time to make a conclusion.
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:28.920]   So let's say I'm in that state.
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:30.280]   Let's say I'm in that state
[02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:32.720]   because of something that just happened, right?
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:35.040]   And now we have some sort of conflict, right?
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:37.080]   And for me to realize like, well, what's going on in me?
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:39.920]   I'm bringing to this a lack of clarity
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:42.680]   because I'm really activated, right?
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:45.120]   From that sense, the anxiety, the tension in me
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:47.000]   has been raised to the negative emotion
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:50.520]   that reflexive negative affect feeling emotion
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:52.040]   has been raised in me.
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:54.720]   And then I realized like, I don't know how it's gonna go
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:58.240]   if we interact about it now because I can't rely on me.
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:00.200]   So like, hey, can we talk about this later?
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:02.080]   The same way if you recognize in the other,
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:03.640]   that person who's usually rational
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:05.440]   is like it was all worked up,
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:06.940]   recognize that in the other, right?
[02:55:06.940 --> 02:55:08.480]   And maybe that person doesn't realize that
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:09.560]   they still wanna interact.
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:12.120]   And you say, can we, let's revisit this.
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:13.880]   And we're like, we're both kind of calm, cool,
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:15.200]   and collected, right?
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:18.960]   So mentalization greases the wheels of all progress,
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:21.000]   but like anything else has to be deployed
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.880]   in a way that works.
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:25.360]   And the way that works is I start with me,
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:27.460]   then I go to you, and then I go to us.
[02:55:27.460 --> 02:55:31.800]   I'm fully on board the start with me,
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:35.480]   then to the other, and then to us model.
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:37.280]   It makes total sense, in fact,
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:41.680]   so much so that I'm starting to build an image of my mind
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:44.920]   where first is a kind of a rule,
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:47.640]   which is it starts with self-understanding
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:50.080]   and thoughtful, structured inquiry
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:52.160]   along the lines of the map that was laid out
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:54.560]   in episodes one and two of this series
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:57.720]   and that we've been alluding to numerous times today.
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:00.400]   And then there's a second line or rule
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:03.180]   that I've got written on this imaginary piece of paper
[02:56:03.180 --> 02:56:07.120]   in my mind where anytime I default to thinking about
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:10.580]   another without first going to my own map
[02:56:10.580 --> 02:56:13.000]   and exploring what's going on with me,
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.360]   that my own map starts to become blurry,
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:16.780]   like I'm losing access to it
[02:56:16.780 --> 02:56:18.440]   and it potentially could disappear.
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:20.240]   I'm just creating this in my own mind as a way
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:21.920]   to create a little bit of, I think,
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:25.960]   healthy anxiety to really go there first.
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:27.900]   - Paints the picture, yes.
[02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:32.900]   - And the purpose in having such an image in my mind
[02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:36.140]   that access to the self and understanding of self
[02:56:36.140 --> 02:56:39.480]   is potentially drifting away is because I think for me,
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:42.820]   there's a third line in this rule set that I'm imagining,
[02:56:42.820 --> 02:56:46.960]   which is that the less understanding we have
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:49.400]   of our own map and internal process,
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:52.840]   the more likely I am where we all are
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:56.560]   to just latch onto an unhealthy map,
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:56:58.500]   another unhealthy map.
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:56:59.340]   I have to believe this.
[02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:01.840]   - Or even follow the directions of our own unhealthy map,
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:04.240]   right, which leads us to someone else's unhealthy map
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:06.440]   and then we latch onto it, like you said.
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:07.860]   Yeah, absolutely, yes.
[02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:09.260]   - Yeah, that's right, because it's still active,
[02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:12.520]   even if it's blurry or if it's obscured from my awareness
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:14.180]   and drifting away.
[02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:16.700]   - If I'm trying to guide myself with my broken compass,
[02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:19.020]   I run into someone else with a broken compass.
[02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:21.260]   Now we're both wandering, right?
[02:57:21.260 --> 02:57:23.120]   So be aware if the compass isn't working
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:25.800]   the way we want it to, can we go look at that?
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:29.380]   Can we make the map healthy, make the map accurate,
[02:57:29.380 --> 02:57:31.220]   make the map guide us towards what we want
[02:57:31.220 --> 02:57:33.120]   because then we will find other people
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:35.800]   who've worked on their own maps that way.
[02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:38.720]   - Absolutely, and so often I hear about,
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:42.380]   and frankly I've experienced this feeling like,
[02:57:42.380 --> 02:57:46.640]   oh, it's just a matter of finding somebody who is healthy,
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:49.000]   and then things will be much easier and much better.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:50.920]   And surely that has to be the case.
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:52.480]   And surely there have to be instances
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:56.560]   where people have a interaction with somebody
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:58.280]   that leads to a relationship with somebody
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:57:59.720]   and the other person is much healthier
[02:57:59.720 --> 02:58:02.320]   and whatever trauma we come to the relationship with
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:05.280]   is best supported or better supported than it would be
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:06.880]   if we were with somebody exploitative
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:10.040]   or who is truly damaged in some way
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:11.840]   who basically had a map that was really,
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:12.880]   I don't want to say screwed up,
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:14.440]   but that they had not explored.
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:15.280]   - They need a lot of work.
[02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:18.600]   - They need a lot of work, but I don't see that very often.
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:21.520]   I definitely see people who at least from my outside read
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:23.500]   seem to have healthy maps
[02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:26.880]   or are doing regular exploration of their maps
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:28.160]   and therefore healthy, who knows?
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:31.080]   I don't know what they do with their time
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:32.520]   in every domain of life.
[02:58:32.520 --> 02:58:36.880]   But once again, we come back to this importance
[02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:39.920]   of understanding what's in those cupboards,
[02:58:39.920 --> 02:58:44.080]   what's in those pillars as a not just important,
[02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:47.180]   but critical step in understanding
[02:58:47.180 --> 02:58:50.160]   and building ourselves in positive ways.
[02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:53.040]   And as I said once or twice before in this series,
[02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:55.120]   but I'm going to say it again,
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:57.560]   and I'm sure again and again
[02:58:57.560 --> 02:58:59.240]   before we conclude this series
[02:58:59.240 --> 02:59:02.080]   is that what's so attractive about this map
[02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:07.080]   is that it sets a very clear and simple set of ideals,
[02:59:07.080 --> 02:59:08.520]   not necessarily simple to attain.
[02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:10.320]   And as you've said, it takes time,
[02:59:10.320 --> 02:59:15.320]   but agency and gratitude, empowerment, humility
[02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:18.720]   leading up to peace, contentment, and delight
[02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:19.960]   all as action states,
[02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:24.960]   not as passive states to just bask in and disappear.
[02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:27.240]   And this notion of the generative drive.
[02:59:27.240 --> 02:59:29.920]   And by now in this episode, I'm sure people
[02:59:29.920 --> 02:59:31.320]   are well on board the understanding
[02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:33.680]   that the generative drive is not just about going out
[02:59:33.680 --> 02:59:34.880]   and doing things.
[02:59:34.880 --> 02:59:37.340]   It's about doing things in service to
[02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:40.920]   and in a way that supports learning, knowing, creating,
[02:59:40.920 --> 02:59:44.360]   not just of others and in the world, but inside.
[02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:48.400]   - Yes, I love the map imagery
[02:59:48.400 --> 02:59:51.600]   because you can almost see the map changing, right?
[02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:52.960]   As a person, I imagine the person
[02:59:52.960 --> 02:59:54.980]   is busying away in the cupboards, right?
[02:59:54.980 --> 02:59:56.480]   Oh, there's a lot to work on in this cupboard
[02:59:56.480 --> 02:59:58.160]   and they're busying away and they're doing the work
[02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:00.360]   and we can see the map changing.
[03:00:00.360 --> 03:00:02.600]   That path that looked like a really good path
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:04.840]   actually goes through a swamp.
[03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:07.320]   We can see the swamp on the map, now it appears on the map.
[03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:10.160]   That other path that looked like it's a little circuitous,
[03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:11.480]   that's a good path, right?
[03:00:11.480 --> 03:00:14.120]   Maybe a harder path, it is a little circuitous,
[03:00:14.120 --> 03:00:15.560]   but look where it leads, right?
[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:20.560]   The map becomes clear as we do the work on ourselves.
[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:22.320]   - Yes, and also the understanding
[03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:24.000]   that you've laid out for us here
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.640]   really helps avoid a lot of the common pitfalls
[03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:29.480]   that are associated with sticky language
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:30.840]   and sticky for good reason.
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:32.960]   I mean, what's stickier and more interesting
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:34.560]   for people that are interested in themselves
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:37.240]   and relationship than things like boundaries
[03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:41.300]   or labels like anxious attached or secure attached.
[03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:43.080]   I'm not being disparaging of those labels,
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:45.600]   but I'm realizing those are just labels, right?
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:49.940]   They don't define action items and specific lines of inquiry
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:55.640]   to get us back into our self-understanding over and over
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:00:57.400]   and not as a full-time job, right?
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:00:58.540]   We all have to live our lives,
[03:00:58.540 --> 03:01:01.880]   but as a way actually to be more leaned into life
[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:03.160]   in the outside world.
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:05.720]   - Those labels define people no better
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:07.760]   than the numerical diagnoses
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:12.000]   in the psychiatric taxonomy book that we glorify, right?
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:13.920]   Labels are not understanding,
[03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:16.360]   numbers are not understanding, they can help.
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:17.920]   Taxonomies are good.
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:20.320]   Sometimes labels let us categorize things,
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:24.000]   but labels are not a substitute for understanding.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.240]   Numbers are not a substitute for understanding.
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:31.040]   If we look at ourselves, we get real understanding
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:32.460]   and that's what makes the difference.
[03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:35.060]   That's what bolsters agency, gratitude,
[03:01:35.060 --> 03:01:37.720]   all those good things, clear mentalization,
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:39.840]   greasing the wheels of progress more,
[03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:41.940]   the generative drive getting stronger.
[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:45.080]   We really can find goodness and often do.
[03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:47.280]   And that's why I think everything we're talking about
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:48.360]   is very hopeful.
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:50.120]   I mean, it acknowledges there's complexity,
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:51.360]   there are pitfalls, right?
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:52.540]   There are all sorts of things to it
[03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:55.640]   that we need to be aware of and to be aware of.
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:58.440]   But that doesn't mean that ultimately it isn't positive,
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:00.040]   that we're not speaking to,
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:02.160]   hey, whatever it is that's ailing you,
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:03.460]   that thing can be better.
[03:02:03.460 --> 03:02:07.360]   - Well, I'm so grateful that you're sharing your knowledge
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:10.240]   and experience around all of this with us
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:14.760]   and that you've laid out such a clear and logical
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:17.360]   and deep and tractable,
[03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:19.620]   really actionable understanding of all this,
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:22.800]   that we can engage in is tremendously powerful.
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:25.140]   - Thank you, I so appreciate it, thank you.
[03:02:25.140 --> 03:02:27.020]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:28.820]   about how to improve your relationships
[03:02:28.820 --> 03:02:30.360]   with Dr. Paul Conte.
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:32.380]   I'd also like to take a moment to remind you

[03:02:56.860 --> 03:02:58.800]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:01.140]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:03.780]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:05.560]   or guests that you'd like me to consider hosting
[03:03:05.560 --> 03:03:06.960]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:09.180]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:03:09.180 --> 03:03:11.060]   I do read all the comments.
[03:03:11.060 --> 03:03:13.220]   And if you're not already following me on social media,
[03:03:13.220 --> 03:03:15.260]   I am Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[03:03:15.260 --> 03:03:16.980]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn,
[03:03:16.980 --> 03:03:18.500]   Threads and Facebook.
[03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:20.180]   And on all those platforms,
[03:03:20.180 --> 03:03:22.220]   I discuss science and science related tools,
[03:03:22.220 --> 03:03:23.860]   some of which overlap with the content
[03:03:23.860 --> 03:03:25.180]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:27.260]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:28.540]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:03:28.540 --> 03:03:31.720]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:32.960]   Not on today's episode,
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:35.440]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:36.820]   we discussed supplements.
[03:03:36.820 --> 03:03:38.960]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:40.900]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:03:40.900 --> 03:03:42.360]   for things like enhancing sleep,
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:44.660]   for hormone support and for focus.
[03:03:44.660 --> 03:03:46.240]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:47.360]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:49.840]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:52.780]   So it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:03:52.780 --> 03:03:55.000]   If you haven't already subscribed to our newsletter,
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:56.580]   it is a zero cost newsletter
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:03:58.280]   called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:00.120]   And in the Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:02.920]   you get free podcast summaries as well as toolkits.
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:05.040]   The toolkits are brief PDFs
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:07.760]   that list off the specific science backed protocols
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:10.120]   for things like improving your sleep, improving focus,
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:12.580]   optimizing dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[03:04:12.580 --> 03:04:15.060]   We have a complete summary of our fitness series.
[03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:17.180]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[03:04:17.180 --> 03:04:20.020]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:22.880]   scroll down to newsletter and provide your email to sign up.
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:25.280]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:27.540]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[03:04:27.540 --> 03:04:29.060]   with Dr. Paul Conte.
[03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:31.100]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:04:31.100 --> 03:04:32.940]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:04:32.940 --> 03:04:35.520]   [upbeat music]
[03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:38.100]   (upbeat music)
