[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.140]   Welcome back to the podcast. Today's question is not uncommon. We very often hear from Christians
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.280]   who came to embrace Reformed theology in college or shortly thereafter, and those same believers
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.360]   are now having children of their own, and they're now building a family with children,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.020]   children that may or may not be elect in Jesus Christ. And that reality raises huge questions
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.600]   for young Christian parents, like a young mom named Alex. She writes in, "Pastor John,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.140]   my life has been different ever since I first heard you speak at Passion as a college student.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.240]   I'm so thankful for your life and ministry, and I'm getting emotional as I write this.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.380]   By God's grace and through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, your teaching and
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.820]   the resources at Desiring God have made such a huge eternal impact in my life. Thank you."
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.340]   My question to you is this. My son is not even two months old, and he has significant
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.860]   health concerns. We've known about the issues for about six months, and during this time,
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.980]   God has been working something wonderful in my heart as I've submerged myself in Scripture
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.860]   like never before. However, I find myself consistently discouraged by this fact. I know
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.900]   that Scripture does not guarantee my son's physical healing, and it also does not guarantee
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.500]   my son's salvation. I know that because I have been saved by grace, I have a glorious
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.540]   hope, and these trials that I am facing are temporary. So that gives me comfort for myself.
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.900]   But what about my son? I find myself grasping for some sort of truth to give me hope for
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.940]   him, but I can't seem to find any. I know that God will accomplish His purpose for an
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.380]   overall good, but He doesn't guarantee my son's eternal good. I know it isn't sinful
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.700]   to feel this way, but I can't seem to be satisfied with God accomplishing His ultimate good purpose
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.620]   knowing that it may come with the cost of my son's life. Is this just something that
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.820]   I need to accept?
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.900]   Let's take that last sentence of Alex, "I can't seem to be satisfied with God accomplishing
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:08.380]   His ultimate good purpose knowing that it may come with the cost of my son's life."
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:17.140]   I wonder if it might be helpful to point out to Alex and to the rest of us that in this
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:30.580]   world we're not supposed to be "satisfied" with sickness and death and lostness the way
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:40.260]   we will be in the age to come when all of history is complete and every thread of the
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:49.820]   tapestry of providence is woven into its place and we have been completely perfected so that
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.860]   we no longer see through a glass darkly. I wonder. In other words, maybe Alex is asking
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.420]   for more now than the New Testament says we can have or should have. Now, why would I
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.540]   say that? Let me give some reasons. I'll sum up these three reasons with the words
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.060]   "tears, prayers, and deeds." Tears, prayers, and deeds. And all three of these show that
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.060]   God intends for us to experience a kind of holy dissatisfaction with this world the way
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:39.460]   it is until He comes. So first, tears. Listen to Paul talk about his own effort to deal
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:47.340]   with the lostness of his kinsmen. This would be like Alex thinking about her son, I think.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.260]   Romans 9, 1-3. "I am speaking the truth in Christ. I'm not lying. My conscience
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:01.940]   bears me witness in the Holy Spirit that I have a great sorrow and unceasing anguish
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.740]   in my heart." Let that sink in. It's great and it's unceasing. That's just almost
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.180]   unthinkable for the man who said, "Rejoice in the Lord," and again I say rejoice.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.340]   And rejoice in all things. Rejoice at all times. So he's got joy while this is happening.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.620]   And this is happening while he's got joy. "I have great sorrow and unceasing,"
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.480]   mark it, "unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.660]   and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh."
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.260]   In other words, they're cut off from Christ. They're perishing. That's the reason he's
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.660]   in great sorrow and unceasing anguish. And listen as he describes his ministry with
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.740]   those who reject Christ. And even with the strugglers who believe. He says in Philippians
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.140]   3, 18, "For many of whom I've told you often and now tell you with tears, walk as
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.740]   enemies of the cross of Christ." He's weeping over these enemies. And Acts 20, 31, "Therefore
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.380]   be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:19.540]   with tears." Or Romans 12, 15, "Listen, weep with those who weep."
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:27.220]   It seems to me that all of this is Paul's way of saying history has not yet arrived
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:36.460]   at a point, and we have not yet been sanctified to a point where it would be fitting for anguish
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.980]   and tears to go out of our lives over the pain and lostness of others, especially our
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:53.420]   own families. It is possible to weep, to be in anguish without questioning God's wisdom
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.260]   and goodness and power. Yes, it is. Let me say that again because I think she's feeling
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:05.300]   a tension that she feels may be impossible. It's not impossible. It is possible to weep
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.660]   without questioning God's wisdom and goodness and power.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:17.180]   Second, prayers. I said tears, prayers, deeds. So prayers. We are supposed to have a holy
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:26.660]   dissatisfaction with the world as it is because God tells us to pray that things would be
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:34.780]   different. That's the whole point of prayer. Ask God to do things to make things different.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.860]   Not praying that everything stay exactly the same. There's no point in praying. James
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.100]   said, "You do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive because you
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.620]   ask wrongly to spend it on your passions." In other words, things would be different
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.180]   if we prayed. Then he teaches us in the next chapter, "Confess your sins to one another
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.820]   and pray for one another that you may be healed." It's not wrong to pray for healing as though
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:07.780]   it were calling God into question, which means we should not be satisfied with sickness in
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:15.380]   a way that rules out prayer for healing. And Paul says in Romans 10, "Brothers, my heart's
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.000]   desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved," which means we should
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.340]   not be satisfied with anyone's unbelief in such a way that it keeps us from praying earnestly
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:34.900]   for their conversion. So prayer itself is a witness that God intends for us to have
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.580]   a holy dissatisfaction with the way things are.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.460]   Number three, deeds. Deeds. We should have a holy dissatisfaction with the world as it
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:54.180]   is because God tells us to do deeds that make it different. Not just tears over it, not
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.820]   just prayers for it, but deeds to change it. "Let your light so shine before men that
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.900]   they may see your good deeds and give glory to your Father who's in heaven." Every
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:13.860]   commandment in the Bible is a commandment that unleashes changes in the world. The world
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:20.660]   becomes different every time someone prays and acts.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:30.820]   So here's the upshot for Alex. Not only is it inevitable and right that her heart
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:41.020]   should ache for her son's healing and salvation, but I think she should be encouraged that
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:49.740]   until God gives her some comforting evidence that his purposes are otherwiseâ€”like Paul
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.060]   gets, for example, in 2 Corinthians 12, 7 and 9 about the thorn in the flesh, he stopped
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.340]   praying that this thorn would be removed because God gave him evidence that he had other plans.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:08.100]   But until we can have some kind of comforting evidence, she should take heart that the persistence
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:17.060]   of her prayers are good evidence that God has not decided against her request. I think
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.740]   that's the point of Jesus' parable of the persistent widow in Luke 18. He told
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:30.060]   them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart, Luke 18,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.780]   1. So Alex, that's my prayer for you, and I will pray as soon as we're done here.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:43.500]   That's my prayer for you. Don't lose heart. Push against the darkness with tears and prayers
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:52.420]   and deeds, but don't push against God. Trust God. He's with you in this world-changing
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.980]   battle. He's not against you. Why don't we, before we go, just pray for Alex here.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:06.940]   Father, we just for a moment here pause and ask that you would touch her son and grant
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.100]   him healing, and that you touch her heart, help her to know and make the distinction
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.060]   between pushing against darkness, pushing against unbelief, pushing against sickness,
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:20.620]   pushing against sin, and pushing against you. It's not an easy distinction for people
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.300]   to make, and we ask for her and for others that they would discern that. And so make
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.140]   this helpful for her, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.180]   Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for the question, Alex. This is sobering. Thank
