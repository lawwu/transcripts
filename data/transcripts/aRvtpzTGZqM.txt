[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   Hello, this is Gary Kim at Shepherds Conference 2024. I'm here with Patrick Cho. Patrick, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.440]   Yeah, I'm Patrick Cho. I serve as the pastor at Lighthouse Bible Church in San Diego.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.920]   All right, and Patrick, you've been using the LSB. What do you enjoy about it?
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.920]   Yeah, I think a lot of guys, rightfully so, talk about the consistency of the translation of various words.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.800]   But the thing that really strikes me is
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.600]   actually a lot of the syntactical choices. One passage that I saw recently that a lot of pastors go to during communion
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200]   is in 1 Corinthians 11 23,
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.040]   because it says there, "For I received that which I also delivered to you,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.120]   that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread." And I just thought it was really interesting because of
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.200]   the tenses of the verbs. You have "for I received" aorist tense,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.880]   "that which I also delivered" aorist tense, "that Jesus took bread" aorist tense, but then "in the night in which he was being betrayed," and
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.480]   that's imperfect tense.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.520]   I don't know of any other translation that renders that verse that way, and I was thinking about it like that might not be
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.040]   your major point in your sermon on that text. You might not even draw attention to it,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.440]   but I love the fact that even if you don't know anything about the Greek,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.400]   you can, from the LSB translation, see that something different is happening with that verb.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.920]   And I just love that syntactical choice of
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.800]   translating that verse and really serving as a reflection of the original. Oh, that's awesome. Hey, thanks for stopping by, Patrick. We appreciate it.
