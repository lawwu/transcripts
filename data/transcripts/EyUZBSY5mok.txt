[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   I read this evening in the epistle to the Romans in chapter 10 from verse 14 to 17.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.880]   How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.960]   in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.440]   shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of them that
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.560]   preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things." But they have not all obeyed the
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.360]   gospel. For Isaiah saith, "Lord, who hath believed our report, so then faith cometh by hearing,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.640]   and hearing by the word of God." Now we resume these studies in the epistle to the Romans
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.000]   at the point where we left off three weeks ago. And therefore perhaps it would be as well that
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.760]   I should remind you of exactly what we are doing at the present moment. In these verses,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:13.840]   from 14 to 17, in this tenth chapter, the apostle, you remember, takes up this question,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.800]   which in a sense he has raised by the statement in verse 13, "Whosoever shall call upon the name
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.160]   of the Lord shall be saved." He said that in winding up his argument and his statement about
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.040]   the way of salvation. The Jews are outside the kingdom, they are not Christians, because of their
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.480]   tragic error with regard to the way of salvation. They were seeking it by works instead of by faith.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.840]   And the apostle there quotes that statement from the prophet Joel, where the gospel, way of
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.720]   salvation, had been anticipated, and where God had given this revelation of it to the prophet,
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.240]   as he had to other prophets also. And it is a way which is based on calling on the name of the Lord.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.560]   "And whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." Very well. Now then, the apostle
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.720]   takes this up from the more practical standpoint. He says, "How shall they call on him in whom they
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.120]   have not believed?" You won't call on the Lord until you've believed in the Lord.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.320]   "Then how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.480]   a preacher? And how shall they preach except they be sent?" And then he goes on and gives us
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.560]   this quotation from Isaiah 52, 7, showing that that is the way. But then he takes up the point
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.640]   that all have not believed, all have not obeyed the gospel. And then he establishes that once more
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.520]   by this quotation from Isaiah, "Lord, who hath believed our report." And then he comes back to
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.320]   this final point, "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." Now I've suggested,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.920]   as you'll remember, most of you, that therefore we can subdivide this little section from verse 14
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:24.000]   to 17 into two other subsections. In verses 14 and 15, the apostle tells us of how the general call
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.240]   of the gospel goes out. In verses 16 and 17, he deals with the effectual call. The general call
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.560]   goes out to all, but all do not believe, only some believe. And that is what he deals with in verses
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:51.840]   16 and 17. "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." Well now, there is the general
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.760]   analysis of this section. Now we are considering at the moment still the first of these two
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.360]   subsections, verses 14 and 15. And I've suggested that here we have what we may well call the great
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:16.480]   missionary charter. Here is the great explanation of the missionary enterprise. This is how God has
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.840]   chosen to bring people into the kingdom of his dear Son. It is by this method of preaching.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.560]   It is the great charter, I say, for the whole missionary enterprise. How shall they hear
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   without a preacher? How can they believe unless they know something about the person in whom they
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:45.680]   are to believe? And so on. We've dealt with that. We've also dealt with the calling of the preacher.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.560]   How shall they preach except they be sent? And we've seen that there's very rich and valuable
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.640]   teaching with regard to that question. How the preacher, the true preacher, is a man always who
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:05.760]   is sent of God and not self-appointed. And then we've come to what I have called the message
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.040]   of the preacher. We've seen this great method, and it's done by the preachers. We've seen how
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.800]   they are brought into being. And then, of course, the vital thing is, what is the message of the
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.000]   preacher? And we have seen that, first and foremost, it is a message about him. How shall
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.920]   they believe in him? How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.600]   they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And so on. So the message is essentially a message
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:48.000]   about the Lord Jesus Christ. It isn't merely a moral teaching or an ethical teaching. It isn't
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.640]   a political point of view, and so on and so forth. What makes the Christian message is that it is
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.280]   always about him, this glorious person. He's the beginning and the end. He's at the center.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.400]   Very well, we've tried to look at that. Then we went on to the second characteristic of this
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.320]   message, which is that it is always glad tidings. Now here is the point of this quotation you see
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.200]   from Isaiah 52, 7. How beautiful are the feet of them, as this authorized version has it,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.440]   that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things. We've dealt with the way
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.480]   in which the apostle uses this quotation. How beautiful upon the mountain are the feet of them
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.880]   that bear glad tidings of good things. So we pointed out that the second characteristic of
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   the preacher's message is that it must always be good or glad tidings. And you remember,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.400]   we dealt with it on the last occasion when we met together. If the preacher's message is not
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.600]   glad tidings, it is not the Christian message. This must always be present, and there is no
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.880]   better touchstone by which we can test ourselves or the preaching of anybody else than this
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.680]   particular test. The essence of this Christian proclamation and message is that it is glad
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.720]   tidings. And when the church does not give the impression that she's got the greatest good news
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:26.400]   to offer to this world, she is failing in her function. It is a glorious message of glad tidings,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.600]   and we were able to demonstrate how throughout the scriptures this characteristic is always
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.000]   emphasized. Well now then, that brings us to the third characteristic of this message,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.360]   and that is the good things. Glad tidings of good things. And this is the thing to which
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:56.160]   we must address ourselves this evening. Now, the tidings are glad tidings because they are
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:03.280]   tidings of good things. That's exactly what makes them glad. That's where the whole element of joy
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:11.440]   comes in. The joy is the result of the content of the message. And the content is that which
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.960]   is described by the prophet Isaiah and which the apostle uses here as good. Glad tidings of good.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:27.200]   Glad tidings of good things. Now you will remember that in the actual statement of Isaiah in chapter
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:35.600]   52, 7, he adds even to that, the apostle is giving us the essence of the quotation. Here it is in
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.480]   full. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.640]   publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:54.880]   Zion, thy God reigneth." Now the apostle gives us the essence of that as we have seen. And he holds
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:05.280]   on to this idea of good things. This is what makes the tidings glad. Now what are these good things?
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:14.080]   Well, in a sense, the prophet in using the word salvation summarizes it all. The good things
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:22.160]   of the glad tidings are indeed the message of salvation. In other words, the good things about
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:29.280]   which the apostle is here speaking in his quotation of Isaiah is nothing but what he's
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.040]   already been telling us in the earlier part of the epistle. This is one of the grand statements,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.480]   as we've seen, of the message of the Christian gospel. The apostle has announced it in chapter
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   one at the very beginning in verses 16 and 17. "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. I exult
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.440]   in it. I rejoice in it." Why? "Well, it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.600]   believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For herein is a righteousness from God revealed,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:05.680]   from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.'" Now, and he's gone on to
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.560]   work that out. But here, you see, bear in mind our general analysis of the whole chapter,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:21.440]   the apostle is again summarizing the essential content of the gospel. He's got to do it because
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.600]   he's dealing with this problem of the Jews. And here in chapter 10, in contradistinction to chapter
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.920]   9, where he was more theological, he is now dealing with it from the more practical standpoint.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.640]   And, you see, he therefore finds it necessary to summarize this glorious gospel once more.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.560]   Before he finally sums up the position of the Jews, as he's going to do in chapter 11,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.080]   he's here reminding them, as it were, and reminding all Christian people of what
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.840]   tragedy this is, that they should be holding on to their works, endeavor, and effort,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.520]   going about, as he puts it, taking all this trouble-making, all this fuss, all this energy,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:11.280]   going about to establish their own righteousness, and rejecting these good things which are offered
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:20.160]   to them so freely in the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Very well. As the apostle
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.000]   troubles like this to sum it up all once more, though he said it all in detail,
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:32.080]   you and I have got to do exactly the same thing. Now I want to turn aside for a moment just to
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.880]   elaborate that point a little. I feel that oftentimes, as Christian people, and perhaps
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:45.760]   even as evangelical people, we are very guilty in this way. When we come to a summary of something
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.080]   that we've already gone over, we have a tendency to say, "Oh, well, of course, we've done that.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:56.880]   We go on." But you see, the Scripture doesn't do that. Once a man has lost the thrill of this
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.080]   great gospel, there's something seriously wrong with him. Once a man gets into a state in which
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.360]   he says, "Well, of course, I know all that," and goes on to something else, he's in a very bad
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.000]   condition. Let me put that in another form. I often find that there's a type of evangelical Christian
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.560]   who seems to think that a Sunday evening service which is evangelistic has got nothing to say to
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.920]   him. He says, "I'm saved. I believe it all. I know it all already." And he either doesn't come to
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.920]   the service at all, or else if he does come, he says he spends his time in praying for the
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:36.240]   unbelievers. That seems to me to be a complete contradiction to what is so plainly taught in
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.640]   the Scriptures themselves. If you, my friend, and though you may have been a Christian and
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   saved for fifty years, if you don't rejoice as much today as you did at the beginning in the
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.320]   proclamation of these good things, well then I think you'd better examine the foundations once
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.880]   more. You can never become so familiar with these things that you don't want to hear them again,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.680]   or that they don't move you again, or that they don't thrill you again. The apostle keeps on
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.200]   repeating them, because to him they were the most glorious things conceivable, and he cannot repeat
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:17.040]   it too frequently. Very well, then, we go into this phrase, "good things, glad tidings of good
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.680]   things." What are they? Well, you see, this is the message of this messenger that we see coming
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.160]   there over the top of the mountains. There we are in captivity and in bondage, and we can do nothing.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.320]   But we see the messenger coming. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:42.480]   beareth glad tidings of good things." What's he got to tell us? What are these good things? Well,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.880]   now, let me try and analyze it for you once more, or if you like, give a summary of all the glorious
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:55.920]   things we've been considering together in the body of this great epistle. What are these good things?
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.960]   Well, the first thing we say about them is they are the things that God hath done for us,
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:08.560]   the things that God has provided for us. You see, the first announcement of the gospel is,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:14.880]   in a sense, this. You get it in the words, "And from the mouth of Zacharias, the father of John
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:24.320]   the Baptist, God hath visited and redeemed his people." That's the good thing. It's all there.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.000]   "God hath visited and redeemed his people." What is this good thing that we have to proclaim?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.760]   Well, the apostle in 2 Corinthians 5 says that we are ambassadors for Christ. What's our message?
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.120]   What are we told to say? Well, what we are told to say is this, that God was in Christ,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.840]   reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses to them. There's another summary
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.600]   of it. You see, the New Testament gospels, Paul's especially, are full of this. He keeps on saying
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:01.520]   it, always rejoices in it. God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Or, if you
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:08.880]   like, more particularly in this epistle to the Romans, I've already quoted to you verses 16 and
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.440]   17 of the first chapter. I'll get it again in a most wonderful way, and some of you will remember
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.320]   when we were dealing with it in the 21st verse of the third chapter, where having said that,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.960]   "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by the law is
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:31.200]   the knowledge of sin." Then this tremendous introduction of the gospel, "But now, but now,"
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.640]   and here comes out the good thing, "the righteousness of God, apart from the law,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.080]   is manifested." This thing that was witnessed by the law and the prophets, it's now come.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.480]   "Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.280]   believe, for there is no difference." The very thing he's saying here in chapter 10. You see,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.840]   he said it all, but he's repeating it. He's summing up this great way of salvation in
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:04.320]   contradiction to the error of the Jew. In other words, the first thing we have to emphasize under
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   this heading of good things is, the great good news that comes to us is this, that what men had
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.840]   failed to do, what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, as he's put it in
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:23.440]   chapter 8 in verse 3. "God himself, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.360]   and for sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of God might be fulfilled in us
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:36.960]   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The first note then in this good thing
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:46.560]   is that God has intervened. God has entered, as it were, into the fight. God has taken the action.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:56.080]   He had promised it. The Old Testament is full of the promise. "The seed of the woman shall bruise
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.920]   the serpent's head." There's to be an end to this warfare between the seed of the serpent and the
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.400]   seed of the woman, in which the seed of the woman had been defeated so much. A seed of the woman
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:15.920]   is going to come that shall bruise the serpent's head and shall conquer him. "O loving wisdom of
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:22.400]   our God, when all was sin and shame, a second Adam to the fight and to the conflict came."
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:28.640]   That's it. The great thing, therefore, at the beginning is that God has done something,
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.600]   and he has done it in and through his only begotten Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:42.640]   There's the first element in this good thing. But secondly, why has God done this?
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:50.720]   You see, the message is about good things. So the second element is why God has done all this.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:59.280]   And here the apostle, constantly in his epistles, keeps on using these great terms,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.440]   which are the most glorious terms in the whole of the Bible, the great terms of salvation.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.720]   What are they? Well, you've got a wonderful summary of them in the second chapter of the
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.960]   epistle to the Ephesians. I turn to that simply because they all happen to be very close together.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.040]   We've got them scattered about the epistle to the Romans, but listen to them here in
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:26.240]   Ephesians 2, verse 4 and following. "But God," listen, "but God," you see, there it is,
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.760]   "men in his utter failure," first three verses, which end up by saying that we were all by nature
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.040]   the children of wrath, even as others. We were dead in trespasses and sins and completely helpless,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:48.560]   then, "but God." But why has God done anything? Here's the answer. "Who is rich in mercy,"
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:55.600]   here are the good things, the mercy of God. "Not only that, for his great love,"
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:03.280]   mercy, love, "wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.840]   with Christ by grace he has saved, and hath raised us up together and made us sit together
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:14.400]   in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show," what? "All the
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:26.560]   exceeding riches of his grace," here are the words, mercy, love, grace, "in his kindness,"
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:35.920]   there's the next, "in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus." Now, I don't stay with
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:42.320]   these terms tonight, we've dealt with them, but I do rejoice in repeating them, and I trust your
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:50.560]   hearts are warmed as I remind you of these great terms, God's mercy. That means that he looked down
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:58.560]   upon our pitiful condition and felt for us. That's the mercy of God. "Then his great love,"
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:05.520]   you can't define, you can't describe the love of God, all you can say is that God is love,
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.320]   the love of God which passeth knowledge. "Then grace, unmerited favor,"
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   we merit no favor, we deserve nothing but punishment and hell, we deserve nothing but
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:26.640]   the wrath of God that is upon us all by nature because of what happened to us in Adam, as the
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:32.000]   apostle has already told us in chapter 5 and in verse 12 and following. But you see, God doesn't
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.760]   deal with us in those terms, he deals with us in grace, unmerited favor, kindness to those who don't
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:46.320]   deserve any kindness or any mercy or compassion. "Grace," yes, the poets write grace, "tis a
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:53.600]   charming sound melodious to mine ear." And it's one of the tests of our faith as to whether the
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.880]   word grace is to us a charming sound, and then that word kindness. Now, these are the good things,
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:08.640]   you see, that God has been pleased to manifest his mercy, his love, his grace, and his kindness
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.560]   toward us. Here are we in captivity, here are we under the condemnation of the law and the wrath
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:20.000]   of God, but a messenger comes over the mountaintops and what's he say to us? Well, he tells us God is
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.680]   not only just and righteous, he is just and righteous, but he isn't only that. God is love,
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:33.840]   God is full of mercy and of compassion, God taketh no delight in the death of the ungodly,
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.160]   and so on. So that is why he has done these good things and these great things.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:47.680]   And then I must emphasize, as the very word good insists upon our doing,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:22:00.160]   the superlative character of these attributes of God that have led him to do these things for us
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:07.280]   and for our salvation. And you noticed in the quotations there from the second chapter of that
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.840]   epistle to the Ephesians how the apostle brings out not only adjectives but superlatives, and
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.320]   even they are not enough, and he adds to them in the third chapter. But let me again remind you of
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:29.680]   the slogan, God who is rich in mercy. God is full of mercy, he is rich in it. It's not just a little
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:39.360]   mercy. God is superlative in everything. All his attributes are absolutes. He is rich in mercy.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.320]   And then you see, he is not content with saying, for his love wherewith he loved us. No, no,
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:52.000]   his great love wherewith he loved us. You see, this is all in this little word good.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:02.080]   Little word good, I say. That's the content of the word good. Great love. And if the love of
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.880]   God were not a great love, none of us would be here tonight, and there'd be no such thing as
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:15.920]   a Christian. We'd all be damned and lost forever. Great love. This man's announcing good things.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:22.640]   The missionary goes and tells people about this glorious God. They are worshipping their gods,
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.200]   they are worshipping idols. They don't know God. They don't know the true God,
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.080]   they don't know the living God. Their whole conception of God is inadequate and unworthy.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:40.560]   This is God. Good things about God and what he's done for men. So you see, you emphasize
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:47.360]   the great love. And then you come to the next term, that in the ages to come, he might show
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:56.960]   not merely his grace, but the riches of his grace. But you see, even that isn't enough. He's got to
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   add to that, that he might show the exceeding riches, the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.920]   Words become inadequate. The thing is so glorious, it's so wonderful. And this, you see,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.720]   is the Christian message. This is what the Christian preacher preaches. He's not just a man
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.280]   who's protesting against atomic bombs, or against war, or telling people not to do this, that,
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.360]   and the other, and teaching a little bit of morality and decency and niceness out upon the
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:29.760]   suggestion. How beautiful upon the mountain are the feet of this man who's got glad tidings of
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:39.680]   good things. He's telling us about the exceeding riches of God's grace. But when he comes to the
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.600]   third chapter, he finds even that inadequate. Because he describes himself as a preacher in
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.960]   verse 8 of chapter 3 by saying, "And to me, one less than the least of all saints, is this grace
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:25:01.120]   given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ." There's no end to
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   it. They're inexhaustible. He talks about a love that passes none. He says that it's going to be
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.400]   possible for us to be filled with all, that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.640]   And he says that the message that he's got to give is this. It is a message about one
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:28.960]   who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:36.880]   according to the power that worketh in us. That's the content. And I am emphasizing
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:45.040]   the superlative character. It's glad tidings of good things. And here we are peeping into
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.880]   and glimpsing at some of the content of this goodness, which is the goodness of God himself,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:58.560]   the glory of God. And God is good. God is light. God is love. All these glorious attributes of
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.400]   God in all their fullness have come together in order to bless man. That's the message of the
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:14.960]   preacher. Glad tidings of good things. But come, let us again remind ourselves of the actual content
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.800]   those are the characteristics of these good things. What are these things?
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:28.160]   Oh, I find it difficult to leave this word good. Do you find them good, my friends?
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:35.280]   Are these things moving you? Are these things thrilling you? Are you more and more amazed at
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.440]   them? I have a feeling that the trouble with the church is today that we don't know how to use this
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:49.840]   word good. We've turned the glories of the gospel into things, and the glory somehow is missing.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.520]   Orthodoxy even isn't enough. If your orthodoxy doesn't move your heart,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.160]   if it doesn't fill you with praise and rejoicing, there's something wrong.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:06.640]   God deliver us from the mere barren intellectual belief of these truths,
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.680]   and bring them to us with such power that we'll know always and feel that they're good things,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:22.000]   and see something of their glory until we are lost in wonder, love, and praise. Very well,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.720]   what are these things then, which are so good? Well, now then, let me just summarize what the
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.600]   apostle has been telling us. He's doing it himself. I'm just following him. The first
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.320]   great thing is, you see, justification by faith only and its consequences.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:44.480]   This is why he's not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Herein is a righteousness from God
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:51.840]   proclaimed, through faith, by means of faith. This is the way, and this is the most wonderful
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.160]   thing that has ever come into this world. This is the greatest good news that men can ever hear,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.840]   that he's no longer doomed. He's doomed, of course, as long as his salvation depends upon himself.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.960]   If salvation depends upon a man's good deeds and good life and striving,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.320]   every one of us is lost. By the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.640]   No man shall ever be justified, as he's told us in the third chapter in verse 20.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:26.400]   We conclude that by the deeds of the law shall no man be justified, for by the law
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.560]   is the knowledge of sin, and no more. In chapter 7, he's shown us how, in a sense, because of our
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:38.560]   sinful nature, it even aggravates our problem and makes us sin all the more. The motions of sin,
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:45.120]   motions of the flesh, which were by the law, energized by the law, stimulated by the law,
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:53.440]   the law can't save. But here is the message. The righteousness from God, apart from the law,
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   has been manifested and revealed. And it is this great and glorious message of justification by
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.120]   faith only, or as he's put it in chapter 4 in verse 5, that God justifieth the ungodly.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:13.360]   He doesn't justify you because you've become godly, he justifies the ungodly.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:21.840]   He justifies the sinner as he is. Here is the first great message. Here is the first good thing.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:29.360]   And that, as he's gone on to point out to us, leads to certain results. It means that we are
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:36.400]   freely pardoned and forgiven. It means that our sins are blotted out as a thick cloud.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:45.520]   It means that God declares us to be just in his sight. It's a declaration. There is this forensic
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:52.400]   element in justification. God makes the declaration that he regards us as righteous in Christ.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:59.520]   Our sins are put away altogether. And that of course means that we are reconciled to God.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:05.840]   That means that we have peace with God. You remember there he sums it up himself
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.720]   at the beginning of chapter 5, having worked out his argument about justification, he says,
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:18.640]   "Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God." We are reconciled to God.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:27.120]   He uses the term reconciliation in verses 9 and 10. In verse 10 of chapter 5 he says,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.720]   "If while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more being
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:39.360]   reconciled shall we be saved by his life?" Reconciliation, peace with God. The old enmity
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:47.120]   is gone. The enmity between man and God. The carnal mind, he's told us in chapter 8, 7,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:53.440]   is enmity against God. But it's gone now. We are at peace with God and God is at peace with us.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.640]   God has provided the propitiation himself so that the relationship lost in the sin of Adam
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:08.240]   is now restored. We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. These are the good things,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:13.520]   my friends. These are the glad tidings, that he comes to me in my utter sinfulness and failure
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:20.400]   and says, "You are forgiven because of what Christ has done for you." God was in Christ through that
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.720]   reconciling you unto himself. And further consequences you see, which is outlined and
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:35.440]   worked out of these. That my old men, the men that I was in Adam, has already been crucified
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:44.640]   with Christ. That's chapter 6, verse 6. Knowing this, that your old men was crucified with Christ.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:55.440]   I'm no longer a man in Adam, I'm a man in Christ. My old man is dead and he is dead forever.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.960]   Not only that, because of that, I am dead unto sin.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:13.840]   Reckon therefore, he says, yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin. You reckon it because
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:21.600]   it's true. It's because it's true you can reckon it. Dead unto sin. In the same way, he tells me
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.360]   that I am dead to the law. The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, he tells us in chapter 8,
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:34.480]   verse 2, hath set me free from the law of sin and death. He said it still more plainly and at
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:42.400]   greater length in chapter 7. He's writing to those that know the law and what he tells them is that
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:50.080]   you are also become dead to the law by the body of Christ. These are the consequences of
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:59.120]   justification by faith only. But not only am I dead in that way to sin and to the law, I am now
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:06.960]   a new man. I am in Christ. No longer in Adam, but I am in Christ. My life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:12.720]   I'm a new man. I've got a new nature. I've got a new mind. Not the mind of the flesh,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:20.640]   but the mind of the spirit. No longer the enmity, but a love of God. And I am alive unto God.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:28.080]   Reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.400]   Here are the good things that have come to me, whereas I was dead in trespasses and sins,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.200]   and an enemy and an alien in my mind through wicked works, and having no contact with God.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.800]   I am alive unto God. I stand before him and I can speak to him. In other words,
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.080]   chapter 5 verses 1 and 2. Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.240]   through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access to this grace in which we stand.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:03.120]   I'm alive unto God. I can pray unto God. We are able to enter even into the earliest of all,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:11.440]   says Hebrews 10, 19, by the blood of Jesus. Or Hebrews 4, 16, "Let us come therefore and boldly
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:17.200]   unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.000]   It's because we've got this great high priest. It's because we go by the blood of Jesus,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.600]   so that I can pray. I have access into the presence of God and I can speak to him as my father,
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:36.320]   and make my requests known unto him. Now then, there is a very hurried summary of justification
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:44.800]   and its main consequences. But it doesn't stop at that. That is, of course, the first thing I want
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:51.520]   to know. How can my sins be blotted out? How can I know God? How can I pray? How can a man be just
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.320]   with God? And here's the answer. This man brings it. It's a part of the good things he's got for
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:04.160]   me. He has the glad tidings. But you see, I want more than this. I thank God that my sins are
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.120]   forgiven and that I can pray to God, but I'm left in this world and I've got to fight the world and
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:16.000]   the flesh and the devil. And how can I do this? It's good to know that I'm forgiven, but I might
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.400]   have spent the rest of my life sinning and being forgiven, sinning and being forgiven. Is there no
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:30.720]   hope of my being delivered? And the answer is there is. Sanctification. This new life in the
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:37.520]   Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:44.640]   death. Or as he's put it in the seventh chapter in verse six, "But now we are delivered from the law,
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.560]   that being dead wherein we were held, that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:56.640]   the oldness of the latter." I start out upon an entirely new life. It is a life in the Spirit.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.280]   I'm only giving you headings. I am led by the Spirit.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.920]   As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:15.440]   If any men have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. As the result of this,
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.080]   the Spirit comes to dwell within me. And through the Spirit, the Son and the Father
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.200]   take up their abode within me as a Christian, as a new man. I'm living this new life,
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.600]   alive unto God and alive in the Spirit.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:35.760]   What was promised in John chapter 14 becomes a reality in the Christians.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.840]   And then you see this goes on as this great process of sanctification,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:48.400]   the power of the Spirit within me. You remember how he told us in chapter 8 in verse 13,
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.680]   "If ye live after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye through the Spirit, through the Spirit,
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:37:00.160]   do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." I can't do it, but through the Spirit I can.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.400]   Not only that, as I'm told in Philippians 2, "It is God that worketh in you both to will
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:15.120]   and to do of his good pleasure." And you see, we are no longer the slaves of sin.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.880]   Romans 6, 14 has told me, "Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law,
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:28.640]   but under grace." Romans 6, 17 has told me this, "God bethinked that you were the servants of sin,
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:34.880]   but you have obeyed from the heart the form of sound doctrine delivered unto you." So you're
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.400]   no longer the slaves of sin, you are dead unto sin, and now you are the servants of righteousness.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:48.480]   See, this is the content of the good things. That I am indeed no longer under the dominion of Satan,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   he's still there. I'm no longer under his dominion. I may be fool enough now and again to listen to
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.280]   him, but I'm not under his dominion. "That evil one toucheth us not, the whole world lieth in
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.800]   the evil one, but that evil one toucheth us not. They overcame him by the blood of the lamb and
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:13.920]   the word of their testimony." Not only that, and perhaps the most glorious aspect of it all is this,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:23.520]   that God now looks down upon us as his children and he loves us with an everlasting love.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.560]   Let me read to you again that one wonderful statement in Romans 5, 9, and 10. He says,
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:38.080]   "Much more than being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him." Listen
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.680]   to this, "If while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:51.040]   how much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life?" You see, when God has started doing
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:56.480]   something to you, he's going to finish it. And if he gave up his son to the death of the cross that
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.760]   I might be forgiven, he's not going to abandon me now. He's going on with the work until it
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:07.040]   is complete. "If I was reconciled by the death of the son, how much more shall I be saved in the
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:14.000]   life of the son?" Or if you like, as it's put in an argument in Romans 8, 32, "He that spared not
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.480]   his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.320]   things?" My friend, here are the good things that the preacher is announcing to you.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:31.440]   Glad tidings of good things, that God's your Father, you are his child. He's not going to
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.320]   leave you. He's going on with this until you're absolutely complete. Indeed, if you don't listen
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.760]   to the gospel, he'll chastise you. "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:52.080]   he calleth." Nothing that is essential to your sanctification and mine is left out. It is all in
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:59.920]   Christ. Even when I don't know what to pray for as I ought, I'm told in Romans 8, 25 and 26, or 26
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.360]   and 27, "The Spirit also maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be offered."
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:11.280]   Indeed, I am enabled to say this quite confidently and assured, that though hell may be set against
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.040]   me, though that day by day I may be led as a sheep to the slaughter and be killed all the day long,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:23.120]   nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. And I am
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:30.480]   persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.240]   from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Here are the good things,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.320]   justification, sanctification, and the end, the hope of glory, glorification.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:56.240]   Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:03.040]   have access into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.280]   The glory, it is coming. Do you remember the tremendous statement of chapter 8, beginning
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.960]   at verse 17? "If children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ,
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:21.920]   if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:29.120]   sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:37.760]   in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.320]   For the creature was made subject of enmity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.200]   subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:55.120]   of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:01.520]   creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now, and not only they but ourselves also,
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.560]   which have the firstfruits of the Spirit. Even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:14.800]   waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body, glorification, entire salvation,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:24.240]   delivered from the fall and all its consequences in every single detail, until we are perfectly
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:30.160]   glorified, complete and entire, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:35.120]   That's the content of the good things.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:44.480]   How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that beareth glad tidings of good things.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.600]   Those are the good things that the preacher proclaims. Those are the things that he offers.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.200]   These are the things that he tells men and women are possible if they believe,
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.080]   if they call upon the name of this Lord, good things.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:14.640]   He tells of benediction, of pardon, grace, and peace, of joy that hath no ending,
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   of love which cannot cease. There, my dear friend,
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:35.760]   is the content of this great and glorious message. It's all about him, because it all comes
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:46.320]   through him, this one unto whom we are to call, and its glad tidings, and its glad tidings
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:56.720]   of these good things, the unsearchable riches of Christ. That's the message of the preacher.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:02.160]   Well, we've got to leave it at that tonight, but you see, this is what we've got to go on to
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:12.320]   consider. Let us prepare our minds as we do so. Here's the message. God raises, calls,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.800]   sends preachers to bear the glad tidings of these good things.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.720]   But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.920]   For Isaiah said, "Lord, who hath believed our report?"
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:40.400]   These are the good things that the preacher proclaims and announces.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:49.120]   Do we believe them? How can we know that we believe them?
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:56.320]   Well, that's the question, as I told you at the beginning, that the apostle proceeds to consider
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:05.200]   in verses 16 and 17, and which, God willing, we shall proceed to consider next Friday night.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:12.480]   I've been telling you hitherto of this general call, this general proclamation.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:22.960]   We shall consider together how this is made effectual, and how you and I can know,
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.800]   without any doubt at all, as to whether it has been effectual in us.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:38.000]   I can't refrain from anticipating. Are these things to you,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:51.440]   good things, the best things you've ever heard, the only things that rarely matter and count with?
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.920]   Let us pray.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:46:02.640]   O Lord, our God, how can we praise thy name as we ought?
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:10.960]   O, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise,
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:19.120]   the triumphs of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:28.560]   O Lord, our God, will thou not by thy Spirit bring these things home to us
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.600]   in such power and clarity and conviction,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:40.400]   that we shall be filled with a sense of wonder, love, and praise,
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:50.000]   that we may know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, and that our lives
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.160]   may ever be a praise unto thee in their every part and portion.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:07.920]   Tune our hearts to sing thy praise, streams of mercy, never-ceasing call for songs
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:16.560]   of loudest praise. O God, grant that our praise may be so loud
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:26.240]   that it shall be heard throughout the earth and even in heaven itself. We ask it in Christ's name.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:34.000]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:40.560]   and the fellowship in the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:47.360]   throughout the remainder of this our short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:59.520]   and until the great adoption shall have arrived, and our very bodies shall be redeemed and glorified,
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:06.000]   and we shall be in the glory everlasting. Amen.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
