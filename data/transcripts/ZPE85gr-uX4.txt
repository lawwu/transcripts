[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Welcome back to this new week on the podcast, week number 530 for us.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Number 530, that's amazing. Thanks for being a part of this podcast
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   over the past decade and thank you for praying for God to
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   sustain us in this work. Last Monday we talked about
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   the value and dignity of womanhood, a really important episode in a world
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   just blind to God's glorious and intentional design for male and female creatures.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   That was the APJ 1909. And we celebrated
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   the incredible glories of motherhood as well. On motherhood, I often
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   recommend one episode from seven years ago. We recorded it
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and I'll never forget it. It's titled, "I Want Kids, My Husband Doesn't."
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   APJ 908. It's just a great classic episode in the archive
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   on the glories of motherhood. And as always, you'll find
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   our archive at AskPastorJohn.com and there you can search for
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   episodes 908 and 1909. Speaking of
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   the glories of motherhood, we have an international question today about 1 Timothy
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   2:15, an important text, a curious text, that we
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   haven't touched on in about four years now. And we should and we will
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   because today's question is from a listener to the podcast named Luba, L-U-B-A,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Luba, who asks, "Pastor John, can you please comment on 1 Timothy 2:15?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   What are we as women supposed to be saved from in childbirth
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and what does this mean for women who will never have children? This verse is
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   highly discussed among us Christians inside of Russia.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Thank you for your wisdom. In this context right here in
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   1 Timothy 2, Paul is making the case
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   that qualified men, spiritually
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   qualified men, should be the authoritative
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   teachers, or you could say pastors, elders, in
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   the church rather than women. Now we've addressed
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   that issue several times in Ask Pastor John, but
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   this time the issue is different.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Here's the text at the end of verse 15
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   with a very puzzling sentence. I'll read the whole two
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   verses and then underline that last sentence
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   that she's asking about. "I do not permit a woman to teach
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   and exercise authority over a man. Rather, she is to remain
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   quiet, for Adam was formed first,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   then Eve, and Adam was not deceived,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor." Now here's
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   the sentence. "Yet she will be
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   saved through childbearing
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   What is the meaning of verse 15? "Yet
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   she will be saved through childbearing
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control."
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   She. Who's she?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   She shall be saved refers to the woman, or
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Eve, in verse 14, but
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I think Paul means for us to generalize it—I think Luba
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   is right to make that inference—to generalize it
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   because he shifts from the singular "she"
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   to the plural "they" in the very next
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   phrase. He says, "She will be saved through childbearing
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   if they continue
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   in faith," and the natural way to take this
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   "they" is women in general, so I think
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   she's right to ask the question. She's asking the way she's
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   asking it. So what does it mean that women in general
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   will be saved through childbearing if they continue in
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   faith and love and holiness with self-control? And
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   what about women who never have children? How does the verse apply
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   to them? Some have suggested
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   that "through childbearing" refers to the birth of
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Jesus. Since a woman bore the Savior,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   we could say that women are saved through that
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   childbearing, but that's unlikely
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   because, among other reasons, the only other
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   use of this Greek word "childbearing" is found in 1 Timothy
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   5, verse 14, where it simply
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   means ordinary childbearing among women
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   in general. It says, "So I would have the younger widows marry
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and bear children," childbearing.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So I don't think that's what it refers to.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   What then does it mean, "She will be saved through childbearing"?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And here I'm happy to give credit
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   to Henry Alford, a British scholar who died in
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   1871, who pointed me to a text
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   in 1 Corinthians that I think holds the key
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   to Paul's meaning here. So the key question is,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   what does "through" mean when
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Paul says, "She will be saved"—women in general
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   will be saved—"through childbearing"?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I think what gets most of us off
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   on the wrong foot is that we almost
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   all jump to the conclusion that "through"
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   means "by means of." "She will be
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   saved by means of childbearing."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And then we cast about for how that could be the case. There is another
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   possibility for what "through" means, and that was
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   the clue I saw in 1 Corinthians 3.15,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   where Paul uses this very word
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   in a similar situation, and it means something very
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   different. So here's what Paul is
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   talking about there. You remember he's talking about the judgment
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   according to our works, in particular whether
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   we've taught true things in the context of the church. And he says there's
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   wood, there's hay, there's stubble, and if
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   some of your works are wood, hay, and stubble, they're going to be burned up
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   at the judgment. And then he holds out hope that the person
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   himself, even though the wood, hay, and stubble of his works
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   gets burned up, might be saved, even though
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   he has not lived the life that
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   he should have lived in any perfect way. He says
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   it like this. "If anyone's work is burned up,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   he will suffer loss, though he himself
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   will be saved, but only as
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   through fire." So there's that
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   saved idea and through idea.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Now what's the meaning of "through" here, which is the same word
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   used in 1 Timothy 2.15? It does not
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   mean "by means of." You say, "by means of fire."
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   He will be saved, what,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   through fire, in the sense that fire
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   is threatening him, and he comes through
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   it safe. It means virtually in spite
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   of fire. Even though he is under the threat
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   of fire, yet he will be saved. He will come
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   through it saved. So my suggestion
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   is that this is the way we should try to
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   understand the word "through" in 1 Timothy 2.15
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   when Paul says, "She will be saved through childbearing."
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Now how would that work? She will be saved in spite
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   of childbearing. Sounds kind of odd.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Or through childbearing, the way a person comes through
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   some threatening circumstance. Well,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   go back to Genesis 3 and remind yourself
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   what happened after Adam and Eve sinned,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   which is the context here in 1 Timothy 2. What happened
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   was that both of them were told that the curse of
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   sin would fall on each of them in their
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   respective special role. Adam
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   in his farming work, sweat of his face,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and Eve in her childbearing. So Genesis 3.16
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   says, "To the woman God said,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   'I will surely multiply your pain in
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   childbearing. In pain you shall bring forth
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   children.'" Now let's let that sink in for a
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   minute. How that must have landed on women
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   for centuries, especially before
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   modern medicine. No hygiene,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   no spinal blocks, no episiotomies,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   no sutures, no cesareans, no antibiotics,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   no painkillers, and often
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   no recovery. Untold numbers
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   of women died in childbirth, and
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   countless more suffered the rest of their lives from wounds
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   tearing that prevented childbirth or any kind of normal
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   sexual life. In other words, there were aspects of
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   childbearing that felt like a curse from God
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   because, in a sense, they were.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And often that burden lasted a lifetime,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   not just in the moment of birth.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   How easy it would have been for women
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   in Paul's day, for example, or through the centuries
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   to despair and feel that God was against them.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   He's just against them. He was their cursor,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   not their savior. The pain of childbearing, the misery of its
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   long-term effects, often was a reminder of God's
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   displeasure over Eve's sin. Now I think that
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   is what Paul is responding to.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And his response was gospel hope.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   In other words, no to the curse. No!
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   These pains of childbearing, even
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   if they last a lifetime, are not
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   God's word, his final word
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   to women. God intends to save.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   They will be saved through the fiery trials
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   of childbearing, through the apparent curse of childbearing.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   In spite of childbearing being part of God's curse on sin,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   women will be saved through it.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And then Paul adds, "If they continue
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   in faith and love and holiness with self-control," which simply
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   means, I think, if they're Christians, that's
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   the link with the Savior. She's justified by faith.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Then love and holiness and self-control are simply the fruit
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   of faith that confirm that it's real for men and women.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   She is a real Christian, and that's how
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   she will be saved in spite of the
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   curse of painful reminders of the curse
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   of God in childbearing through
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Eve's disobedience. So in answer
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   to Luba's question about, "Well, what does this mean for women who
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   have never had children or will have children?"
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   It means this. Though they may never
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   have tasted the pain of childbearing
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   in their own bodies, they still
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   might feel a solidarity with all
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   women under the curse of the pain of childbearing
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   because of sin entering the world. And so
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   they can share in the same hope as women
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   who have had children, namely the hope that in spite of pain,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   women have to endure in spite of that pain
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   because of the fall. Nevertheless, God is for
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   them, not against them. And if they trust in
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Jesus Christ and walk in lives of holiness,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   they will be saved.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the excellent question all the way from Russia.

[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   call Christian hedonism? And what's the best, simple,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   short definition of Christian hedonism? Well, Pastor John has his
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   favorite version of it, and we're going to hear it next time. "Christian Hedonism in Two
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Minutes." I'm your host, Roderick E. We'll see you Wednesday.
