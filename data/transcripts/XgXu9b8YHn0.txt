[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   A few things in my 50 years in the ministry, more or less, have been more gratifying to
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:22.720]   me than to see the all-pervasive, all-governing sovereignty of God, which we're going to talk
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:33.120]   about as providence, move from being a stumbling block, that it is to so many people, to being
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:47.460]   a soul-stabilizing, insanity-removing power as our people walk through hellish circumstances.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:58.680]   To see that move in a church from being absolutely perplexing and maddening to being life and
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:08.960]   hope to watch providence move from there to there has been over my years gloriously gratifying.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.080]   For example, a quote from one of our missionaries 40 years ago from China.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.200]   "In December of 1987, my father died unexpectedly at age of 63.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.640]   I was plunged into a journey of several months, struggling to understand what had happened.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.100]   I was at Bethlehem," our church, "but new to the teaching and apparently missing many
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.400]   of the distinctives."
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.660]   Fast forward to 1992.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.380]   We had been in China for a year and returned home to have our first child.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.460]   As you remember, she lived one day and died in our arms.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.240]   It was then that the teaching of God's providence came home to roost.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.060]   God had not turned us loose to some natural events, but in his divine mercy had seen fit
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.540]   to give us a child, and through the process of taking her from us, work in us a honing
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.980]   and sanctifying unlike anything we'd ever known.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.440]   Thanks to the foundation laid in my life through our years at Bethlehem, I was now able to
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:41.300]   embrace and understand such verses as, "The Lord gives, and the Lord has taken away.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.540]   Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.460]   There was another missionary couple who went out from us to the Middle East.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.660]   They're still there, by the way, but something happened in between.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.500]   Not long after, they got pregnant, first time, and they went to Turkey, a nice safe place,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.540]   a more advanced place to have their child, and he was born and he died.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.860]   They came home to recover.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.300]   They didn't stay home, but they came home, and their first Sunday back was a morning
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   when I was on the front row getting ready to preach.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.180]   They were sitting, we had these rows that come in like this.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.180]   They're sitting over here.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.260]   I can see them, first Sunday back, and it was the very first Sunday that we sang as
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.980]   a church, "Blessed be your name on the road marked with suffering, though there's pain
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.540]   in the offering, blessed be your name.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.620]   You give and take away.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.060]   You give and take away.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.940]   My heart will choose to say, 'Lord, blessed be your name.'"
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:08.580]   And I looked over, and they were both standing there like this, empty hands of submission.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.180]   And I thought, "That's worth a lifetime of ministry."
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.140]   One more woman with uterine cancer, then I'll tell you in a minute why I'm giving you all
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.140]   these stories.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.940]   I came to Bethlehem 10 years ago.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.180]   I had been a believer for only a few years.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.980]   Within a few weeks of attending, I began to hear your teaching on God's sovereignty in
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.220]   salvation, and it was the weirdest thing I had ever heard.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.100]   It sounded archaic and un-American.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:56.340]   And later, I realized it truly was archaic and un-American, but genuinely biblical.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:04.900]   Eventually, by the awesome weight of scriptural evidence, I was compelled to adopt the Reformed
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.860]   perspective on God's sovereignty.
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.660]   Little did I know that the hunger to understand God's nature and His ways over the past 10
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:22.220]   years was graciously given to fortify me for this year's surprise of cancer diagnosis.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.140]   Of course, the news that I had a life-threatening illness, the realization that I would not
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.980]   be able to have children was horribly painful.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.980]   But the powerful assistance that comes through truth amazed me.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.220]   Theology can be so practical.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.060]   It does wonders for anxiety and self-pity and despair.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:06:00.220]   I am so glad God ordained my conversion to Reformed theology prior to ordaining my cancer.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:08.620]   I know He is immeasurably strong and thoroughly in charge and 100% on my side, even when He
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:17.460]   sends painful circumstances, was a Spurgeon that said, "I will kiss the waves that dash
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.020]   me upon the rock of ages."
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:29.420]   Now, the reason for beginning with those three stories is because I want there to be a tone
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:36.620]   in this room as I talk about providence.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:45.660]   The reality of God's all-governing, all-pervasive, purposeful sovereignty, which we call providence,
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:54.280]   is controversial, and I don't want to think about it mainly that way.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:01.300]   From now until the day that you see Jesus, there will always be people who turn red in
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:18.860]   the face and spittin' mad if you come even close to suggesting that God took their baby.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:27.260]   From now to the end of history, there will be scholars and pundits and articles and blogs
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:39.140]   and books describing the God of Jonathan Edwards and the God of John Piper as a moral monster.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:47.340]   Your job when those things happen, if you happen to love the God I love, will not be
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:56.780]   to return evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but to absorb, like Jesus did, absorb the
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:05.820]   slander, the abuse, hand it over to God, like Jesus did, patiently return good for evil,
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.100]   meet their needs.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:14.980]   And I bear you witness, like I did, I think, on the Q&A this afternoon, I bear you witness,
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.420]   some of those spittin' angry enemies will do a 180, and they'll love you.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:28.700]   It might take 10 years, but don't give up, don't give up on them.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.900]   Don't go online with guns blazing, this is not the kind of doctrine that should be handled
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.700]   that way.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:43.180]   The great design of the doctrine of providence is to be the ballast in the boats of your
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.740]   people to keep them from capsizing in the waves of suffering.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.540]   That's what it's for, and your job is to put it there, and if they keep pitchin' it out,
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:01.780]   just keep puttin' it back in, and do the best you can to win them to biblical truth.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:07.660]   So that's the spirit in which I want you to hear this message, and that's the spirit I
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.220]   think you should have as you try to build your people's understanding and acceptance
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:21.600]   and love for the doctrine of God's absolute, all-pervasive, all-governing, purposeful sovereignty
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.900]   called providence.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.220]   So we're going to do it in three steps.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.660]   First, we're going to talk about the definition a little more fully.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.620]   I've given my definition with the phrase "purposeful sovereignty," but I want to say some more
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.420]   about the meaning of providence.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:49.860]   Number two, we'll talk about the truth that's going to triumph through providence, namely
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:56.260]   certain glorious promises that God has held out to us about His future for us.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:03.080]   So collect some promises together that sum up the glorious future that we're looking
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:11.980]   forward to, and then notice that there are massive obstacles between those promises and
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.580]   their fulfillment that only providence could remove.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.260]   And the third thing is, how does He remove them?
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:27.700]   So a definition, promises of God's future, and how providence removes the obstacles of
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.260]   those promises.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:36.380]   So, clarify the definition, identify God's promises, and how providence secures those
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.380]   promises.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.620]   So, number one, some thoughts about definition, the meaning of providence.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:47.820]   The Word is not in the Bible, in the English Bible, at least not in the ones I have.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.980]   And therefore, when we talk about a definition of a Word that we use a lot and it's not in
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:00.500]   the Bible, we need to be very careful that we assemble our definition from biblical realities
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:06.060]   that are really there, and then don't over-claim anything for the Word since it's not there,
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.340]   but make clear what biblical realities it's trying to sum up.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:19.340]   So I use the phrase "purposeful sovereignty" because sovereignty and providence aren't
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.340]   the same.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.380]   Sovereignty, at least the way I'm using the term, the way I think the Bible uses the term,
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:37.420]   is that in and of itself, the word sovereignty carries no connotation of design or purposefulness.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.300]   God always has design and purposefulness, but it's not in the word sovereignty.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.900]   Sovereignty means He has the power and the right to do anything He pleases, right?
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:59.940]   And then you have to ask, does He please things by plan, or is He whimsical in His sovereignty?
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:08.900]   So the word sovereignty is a glorious word, I love it, but providence is more.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.460]   It's sovereignty plus providence is.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.940]   It implies purposefulness.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:24.380]   Buried in the English word "providence" is the word "provide," which is made up of two
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.660]   Latin words, right?
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:38.780]   "Pro," "toward," "forward," "unto," "videre," "see," which just so happens, amazingly, to
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:46.340]   capture the English idiom "see to."
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:56.980]   So God saw to it that a ram was in the thicket to take Isaac's place.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:02.740]   God saw to it that Joseph would be sold into slavery and save his people.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:09.100]   God saw to it that his son would be murdered and salvation would come to millions.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.060]   See to, providere.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.940]   And all of those imply purposefulness.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:24.340]   God sees to everything purposefully.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.720]   One more clarification on the definition regarding its extent.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:41.660]   I use the phrases "all-governing, all-pervasive," trying to get at how extensive is this purposeful
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.660]   sovereignty?
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:49.180]   Now, we'll see this, the claim that it's all-governing and all-pervasive, we're going to see it
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.820]   in the Bible as we move forward.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:59.900]   But what I mean is that in the entire universe, God governs the smallest thing, like Jesus
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.900]   says, the fall of a bird.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:09.340]   In the darkest forest you can imagine, somewhere where nobody's watching, a bird gets old and
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:16.700]   dies and falls to the ground, God governed that.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:26.040]   Or the movement of stars, Isaiah 40, 26, or the murder of his son, Acts 4, 27.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   The providence of God governs all the moral and immoral acts of every soul.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:44.140]   Neither Satan at his hellish worst or human beings at their redeemed best ever act in
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:56.540]   any way contrary to the ultimate, all-embracing, all-wise plan and providence of God.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.340]   That's what I mean by providence.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:06.940]   Now, second, promises that God has given us in his Word about his ultimate triumph at
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:13.100]   the end, what it would be like, and why we can be thrilled and hope to get there and
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.380]   build our ministries on a confident hope that we're going to get there.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:22.260]   I'm going to mention three promises that I think sum up where everything is going, and
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:29.700]   then we'll step back and say, "Whoa, there's a lot standing in the way of those promises,
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.780]   which only providence can handle."
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:41.820]   So promise number one, the gospel of Jesus Christ will successfully penetrate all the
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:48.540]   peoples of the world and gather into Christ all the ransomed elect.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.540]   That's going to happen.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:56.340]   Matthew 24, 14, "This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.820]   as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.820]   It's promised.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   It's going to happen.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:11.300]   The gospel will reach all the peoples of the world, and it cannot be stopped.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.760]   So if you want to be involved in something that cannot fail, be sure to be involved in
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.580]   world missions.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.980]   It reaches all the peoples, and when it gets there, it succeeds.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.060]   In Revelation 5, 9, all the redeemed are going to be gathered, the ransomed are going to
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.060]   be pulled in.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:36.920]   "Worthy are you to take the scroll, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:43.380]   people from every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.780]   priest to our God.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.500]   They shall reign on earth."
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.140]   All the ransomed from all the peoples, tongues, tribes, and nations are going to be there.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.140]   They're going to come.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.360]   They're going to hear the gospel.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.220]   Faith comes by hearing, and they're going to come.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.500]   It's going to succeed.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.980]   John 10, 16, "I have other sheep that are not of this fold.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.140]   I must bring them also.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   They will listen to my voice, so there will be one flock, one shepherd.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.880]   I must.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.100]   I will.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   I will."
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.460]   It's going to happen.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.700]   That's the promise.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:29.540]   So promise number one, the gospel will reach all the peoples of the world, and it will
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:35.780]   do its mighty work when it gets there, and all the ransomed will be gathered in.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:43.600]   Number two, all of these ransomed elect from all the peoples of the world, the bride of
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:54.020]   Christ will be sanctified, glorified, and made perfectly beautiful for the eternal enjoyment
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.260]   of her divine husband.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.460]   Romans 8, 30, "Those whom he predestined, he also called.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.900]   Those whom he called, he also justified.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.700]   And those whom he justified, he also glorified."
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:16.940]   So the glorification of the predestined, called, and justified is as good as done.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.800]   I think John's going to preach on that tomorrow.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.180]   It's as good as done.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.900]   They are glorified.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.320]   It's going to happen.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.700]   It will not fail.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:33.820]   Ephesians 5, 25, "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:43.540]   sanctify her, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:53.700]   or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish."
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:03.260]   Christ did not die to set in motion a failed marriage.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:08.060]   She will be blameless and beautiful.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.420]   That's why the universe exists.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.140]   She will be beautiful.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:21.140]   First Thessalonians 5, 23, "May the God of peace sanctify you completely, and may your
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:27.180]   whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.200]   He who calls you is faithful.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.780]   He will do it."
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.140]   That's the promise.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:41.780]   So all these reached and ransomed, elect from all the nations of the world, are going to
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:52.220]   be redeemed and justified and sanctified and glorified and made spectacularly beautiful
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.820]   for the enjoyment of her husband, Jesus Christ.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.660]   Number three, third promise.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:14.540]   This beauty of the bride will consist, most essentially, in the sinless echo of Christ's
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:27.200]   excellencies, his preciousness, reverberating back to him in the all-satisfying pleasures
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.680]   that his people find in him forever.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:37.840]   Now that's a long, complex sentence, and it contains all of my theology.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.220]   That's why it has to be long and complex.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.340]   I'm going to read it again, and I hope you can get it.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:50.660]   So the beauty of the bride, for which the universe was made, the beauty of the bride
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:57.020]   will consist essentially, not only, there are other things to say about this bride,
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:07.660]   but essentially, in the sinless echo of Christ's excellencies -- emanation, remanation, Jonathan
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:21.620]   Edwards -- echo back the excellencies of Christ in the all-satisfying pleasures that she has
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.020]   in him forever.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:37.380]   That's what her sinless excellencies or his sinless excellencies do when they are properly
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.460]   seen and tasted and enjoyed.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:50.140]   They echo back his worth, his preciousness, and the end of all things has been reached.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:58.180]   Isaiah 55, 12, "You shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:04.580]   The mountains and the hills before you will break forth into singing, and all the trees
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.420]   of the field will clap their hands.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   Instead of the thorn will come up the cypress, instead of the brier will come up the myrtle,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:27.500]   and it -- what's that -- and it shall make a name for the Lord, an everlasting sign that
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.940]   shall not be cut off."
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.300]   What's the "it"?
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:40.580]   The "it" is the spectacular joy of the creation.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.060]   She's going to go out in joy.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.820]   The mountains are going to clap their hands.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:53.820]   They're going to sing, and it will be for the name of the Lord, an everlasting sign.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:23:03.500]   The joy of the bride will be the sign of the worth of the name of the Creator, the Bridegroom.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:09.340]   That's the gist of the argument of Isaiah 55, 12 to 13.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:16.540]   All creation, especially the bride, but also maybe even dogs.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.420]   Not cats, I think, but dogs.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:26.700]   Although, I do have a theology of glorification that might allow cats in.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:32.980]   Because they're going to -- I mean, big cats are going to be there for sure, right?
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.980]   Lion.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:40.100]   They're going to lie down with the lamb.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   But I digress.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:51.380]   Isaiah 35, 10, "The ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:58.620]   Everlasting joy will be upon their heads, and they shall obtain gladness and joy, and
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.380]   sorrow and sighing will flee away."
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.780]   And what's the center of that joy, that gladness?
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.540]   Revelation 21, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with them.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.780]   He will dwell with them.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:20.580]   They will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.500]   He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.500]   Death shall be no more.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:30.300]   Neither shall there be mourning nor crying anymore, nor any pain, for the former things
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.380]   have passed away."
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:38.620]   God is the center of their joy, the focus, the source of their joy.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.380]   You make me know the path to life.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.740]   In your presence, there is fullness of joy.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.420]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:54.900]   And that's the end of the story.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:01.940]   One of the tests you can make of yourself and your understanding of worship, true, authentic,
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:09.540]   inner worship, not just motions, hands, mouth, whatever, just really what's going on here,
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:16.360]   the test is if you try to use it for anything else.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:21.220]   If you say, "We're going to worship to raise money for our building program, worship to
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:26.980]   bring people into the church, we're going to worship in order to fix our marriages,"
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.060]   you don't understand.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.180]   You don't do worship in order to anything.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.900]   It's the end.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:41.020]   There's no in order to, once you've gotten to the end of the universe's purpose.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:48.700]   Now just a little parenthesis, if you do that authentically week in and week out, marriages
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.380]   are going to be changed.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:58.420]   You can't not have better marriages in a church that's meeting God authentically as an end
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.340]   in himself every Sunday, you can't.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.820]   And everything else has changed.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:16.660]   But if you shoot at that, try to use this authentic enjoyment of God himself as a means
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:25.940]   to something else, you just don't get it.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:37.480]   The ultimate purpose of God's all wise providence then is this enjoyment of God by the bride
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.940]   at the end of history.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.540]   Bring my sons from afar, my daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:56.660]   by my name, whom I created for my glory, that's Isaiah 43, 6, and 7, I created for my glory.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:04.380]   And the way that glory, that worth, that beauty, that greatness, that preciousness of God is
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:17.340]   put on display is that it awakens in us pleasures in him and they echo back to him his worth
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:22.660]   and greatness and beauty, his glory.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.980]   It's a promise, that's going to happen.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.140]   So those are my three promises.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.700]   They're going to happen.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:38.940]   The nations will be reached, the elect will be gathered in and made beautiful for Christ
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:45.380]   and that beauty will consist in our echoing back his excellencies in the enjoyment that
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.900]   we have in him.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.100]   That's the end of all things.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:28:04.180]   None of that's going to happen unless there is an omnipotent exercise of providence because
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:13.460]   there are massive threats and obstacles to those three promises, massive, 10 million
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:19.460]   times greater than you have any hope of overcoming.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.820]   There's only one hope for those three promises to come true and that's the providence of
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.000]   God.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.860]   So that's where we turn now.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:42.340]   What are some of these threats, obstacles, and how does God's providence overcome those
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.000]   threats and guarantee the triumph?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.140]   I wrote that sentence and then I stopped and I thought, "No, no, not what I'm going to
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.140]   talk about.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.820]   I'm going to take it up a level.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:05.860]   I'm not going to say what or how does the providence of God overcome those threats and
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.860]   obstacles.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:14.740]   I'm going to ask and show from the Bible, how does the providence of God not only overcome
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:21.540]   them but make them serve His purposes?"
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:29.060]   You know, if you think of, here's God, here's the fulfillment of all things and promises
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.500]   and in the middle there are obstacles and God has to do things to get over them.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.420]   You've created an autonomy here that doesn't, it's not real.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.380]   These obstacles are not autonomous.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:51.300]   I mean, Satan at the center of this threat and this obstacle is not autonomous.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.300]   We're not dualists.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.300]   Right?
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:59.820]   It's like, here's God, here's Satan duking it out.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.260]   They're not duking it out.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.020]   This fellow's done.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.860]   He's a creature.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:20.100]   So what God is going to do, since He plans all things as well as performs all things,
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:27.340]   is not only get over the obstacles but take them captive and make them serve His designs
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.340]   and His purposes.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.340]   That's what I want to see.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   Is that true?
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:34.220]   Because if that's true, oh my.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.820]   How does it change your view of the world in which you live, the sufferings you walk
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:45.060]   through, the miseries of this globe?
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.060]   That's where we're going.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:52.460]   I'm going to steal a little bit of John's thunder here with Romans 8.35, but you pick
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.460]   it up.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.740]   I won't stay long.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:01.660]   Romans 8.35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:08.100]   For tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:13.300]   Now if you stopped right there, rhetorical question, a good prosperity preacher would
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.300]   say, "No!
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   No!
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.420]   They're not going to separate us from the love of Christ because it's not going to happen
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:27.660]   to us."
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.540]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.140]   For tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine?
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.140]   Famine!
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.140]   No way!
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.660]   No way are Christians going to starve to death.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.660]   Or nakedness?
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.660]   No way!
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.500]   There will always be clothes.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.260]   No naked Christians.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.180]   No Christians who can't afford clothing.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.260]   This is a wicked, wicked...
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:32:00.700]   I've got a guy in our church right now from Cameroon, I mean, he's in our seminary, and
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.340]   he's writing his thesis on the prosperity gospel, and it's absolutely, I mean, we have
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:11.580]   exported this, you know, the devastating effects it's having all over West Africa as he sees
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.580]   it in his little sphere.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:24.620]   So my ire gets up a lot when I see that people stop in the middle of verse 35.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.300]   Because if you keep going, everything that I just said is proved false.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.540]   Who shall separate us from the love of God?
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:38.500]   Shall tribulation, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, comma, and
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:48.900]   a quote from Psalm 44, "As it is written, we are being killed all day long."
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.720]   It happens!
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.280]   Nakedness happens!
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.800]   Starvation happens!
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:04.740]   Swords go through Christian necks all day long.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.340]   That's happening somewhere in the world right now.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:12.660]   Not happening in this room right now, but somewhere it's happening, as we heard earlier,
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:21.300]   who filled in, whoever quoted all those incredible statistics about last century and this century
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.620]   martyrdoms.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:30.460]   So there they are, the obstacles right there.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:38.700]   And Paul says, after he says, "We are being killed all day long," there's this adversative
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.500]   which is often translated, "No!"
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.300]   I like that translation, "No!"
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:51.900]   Like, but, but no, "In all these things we are."
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.180]   Now what does that mean?
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.340]   I wonder what MacArthur's going to say.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.260]   What is more than a conqueror?
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:07.420]   I'll give you my take on more than a conqueror, and then you can correct me.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:20.180]   If you got an enemy, an obstacle between you and victory, you and fulfilled promise, and
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:29.980]   you conquer him, he falls dead at your feet, you're dead, over you, I'm going to my fulfillment.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.820]   Okay, that's conqueror.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.260]   What's more than a conqueror?
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:45.360]   My answer is, he gets up and serves you, helps you get there.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.340]   So he's not sabotaging your purpose.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.880]   He's helping you fulfill your purpose.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:59.820]   You defeat him and make him, or make you, more than a conqueror.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:10.420]   So the flag that is flying over Joseph's brother's sin, remember this?
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:19.920]   It sold him into slavery, and it's just shot through with sin, that act of enslaving and
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.980]   almost killing Joseph.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:29.900]   The flag, as you know, flying over that according to Moses' intention, I believe, in Genesis
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:36.580]   is, "You meant it for evil, and God meant it for good," chapter 50, verse 20.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:44.380]   And it does not mean, you can take that, that happened this afternoon as well, that emergency
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.180]   thing going off.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:58.000]   This word "meant" is not, "You meant it for evil, God used it for good."
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.620]   It does not say that, and it does not mean that.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:09.220]   You meant it for evil, the selling of Joseph into slavery.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.220]   God meant it.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.900]   In fact, the psalm says, "He sent him," right?
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.380]   Psalm 105 says, "He sent him."
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.840]   God meant it for good.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:25.820]   So Satan and sinful people have a purpose and a design and a plan for this, and God
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:30.940]   has a purpose and a design and a plan, and this one loses.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.580]   This one wins.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.260]   God meant it.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:41.260]   He didn't play catch-up ball and say, "Oh dear, didn't see that coming.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.180]   How can I use that to save my people?
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.500]   Oh, we'll do this famine thing," and so on.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.060]   It's all planned.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.940]   He meant it.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.120]   He sent him to save this people.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.500]   It was a plan.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:02.600]   So not used, but meant.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:08.620]   So it is with every obstacle, I believe, to God's promises.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:15.220]   It will be with every evil from the fall of Lucifer to the lake of fire.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:22.020]   We should see the flag flying, "Satan meant it for evil, God meant it for good."
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.080]   Satan meant it for evil, you meant it for evil, sinners mean it for evil, God means
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.580]   it for good.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:38.220]   So let's walk through a few of these obstacles to those three promises.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:45.960]   Number one, the most serious, the greatest obstacle between you right now and the fulfillment
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:55.640]   of that promise for you and your church, your family, is the wrath of God against sin.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:02.280]   That's the greatest obstacle in the universe to the fulfillment of God's promises.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:09.760]   God's wrath is the greatest obstacle to the fulfillment of God's promises.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:17.000]   Nothing compares to the horrible, blazing barrier of God's wrath between us and our
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.160]   everlasting happiness in him.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:26.640]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.520]   who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth, Romans 1:18.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.720]   This is why we pour out our lives in the cause of world missions.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:44.640]   The greatest obstacle to the everlasting happiness of every culture and every people group on
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:54.920]   the planet is the wrath of God, and we know how to escape.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:02.320]   Nobody but Christians know how to escape this greatest obstacle to our future happiness,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.080]   everybody's future happiness.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:14.520]   Only one thing can remove this obstacle, the love of God, propitiating the wrath of God
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.520]   through the death of the Son of God to vindicate the glory of God.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:28.200]   That's how it's removed, the love of God propitiating the wrath of God through the death of the
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:38.040]   Son of God to vindicate, Romans 3:25, the glory of God, the righteousness of God.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:45.560]   God put Christ forward as a propitiation by his blood.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:54.120]   But right here, at the most horrible point in human history, the murder of the Son of
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:03.400]   God, right here at the center, the most sinful, the most horrible, most wicked point in history,
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:09.960]   the providence of God is in total control, total control.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:15.860]   And I've already referred to Acts 4, I'm going to read it now because for me, this is one
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:26.840]   of the texts about God's providence that helps most people handle God's sovereignty over
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.640]   sin.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:35.440]   "Truly in this city, Jerusalem, there were gathered together against your holy servant
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:44.760]   Jesus whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:54.780]   of Israel to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place."
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:41:04.520]   So Herod, Pilate, mobs, crying, "Crucify him, crucify him," soldiers driving the nails.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:13.800]   You thought, you four, Herod, Pilate, mobs, soldiers, you thought you were threatening
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.720]   and destroying the saving purposes of God?
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:24.320]   Another resounding, "No!"
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.420]   You were fulfilling them.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:30.560]   You thought you were destroying his purposes?
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.600]   You were fulfilling them.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.440]   In God's providence, you were doing whatever God's hand and God's plan, that's a quote
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   from the Bible, had predestined to take place.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:50.760]   You meant it for evil, God meant it for good.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:59.520]   And the reason that text is so amazingly effective for many, many people in helping them submit
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:06.580]   to the sovereignty and the providence of God is because what's being controlled here by
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:12.900]   God and his plan and his hand is the worst thing in the world, right?
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.240]   There isn't anything worse than to murder the Son of God, and if the worst thing in
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:25.880]   the world, way, way worse than the death of your child, is controlled and planned by God
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:34.320]   for the good purposes of his saving work, everything is, or at least everything can
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:41.080]   be without calling God's morality into question.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:50.720]   So now the ransom of the bride is paid, the sins are covered, the condemnation is passed,
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:43:04.240]   the impending wrath is removed, but for the bride to enjoy all of what she is promised,
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.520]   she must hear and believe, right?
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.120]   Romans 10, 14 to 17, how should they believe?
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.480]   If they don't hear, how should they hear without a preacher?
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.360]   How should they preach unless they're sent?
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   Beautiful feat, take the gospel, faith comes by hearing, no other way.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:31.040]   New birth comes through the living and abiding word of God, no other way.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:40.080]   They must hear and believe the gospel, and Satan in concert with human depravity will
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:48.540]   do everything in his power to prevent that, to prevent them hearing and to prevent them
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.880]   believing.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:59.280]   For example, let's just take kings, governors, who make laws and break laws that hinder the
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.920]   spread of the gospel.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:08.680]   They will lay their hands on you and persecute you, and you will be brought before kings
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:19.240]   and governors for my name's sake, and what does that mean for the spread of the gospel?
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:25.040]   Here's what Psalm 2 says it means, "The kings of the earth and the rulers take counsel together
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.460]   against the Lord and against his anointed.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.720]   He who sits in the heavens laughs.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.040]   The Lord holds them in derision."
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.200]   Why is that?
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:43.480]   Because the most high rules the kingdoms of men gives it to whomever he will, Daniel 4:32.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:49.760]   He removes kings and sets up kings, Daniel 2:21, and when he sets them up, wicked though
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:58.320]   they be, Republican or Democrat form of wickedness, they do what he pleases.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:03.680]   Proverbs 21, "The king's heart and so is the president's heart is a stream of water in
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.140]   the hand of the Lord.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:11.120]   He turns it wherever he wills.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:17.160]   Whether he's born again or not, he is governed by God's providence.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:23.200]   Do you think, O king of Assyria, because you destroy my people that you are not a hatchet
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.760]   in my hand?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:32.600]   Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it, or the saw magnify itself against him
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:40.520]   who wields it, as if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or as if a staff should lift
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.200]   him who is not wood?"
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.360]   No.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:53.600]   When Satan and sin conspire to raise up kings and governors against the mission of God,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.120]   they cannot succeed.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   They cannot.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:06.240]   They are hatchets, rods, axes in the hand of God.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:13.960]   They simply find themselves to be advancing in ways you can't even begin to comprehend
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.960]   the ultimate purposes of God in this world.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.520]   You meant it for evil, Mr. King.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   God meant it for good.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.520]   What about disease?
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.160]   That's a great hindrance, isn't it?
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.240]   We have a missionary family in our church right now, a little baby clinging on for life
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.080]   down in South Africa.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:40.760]   In fact, that particular mission field has just had incredible blow after blow.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:46.480]   Three of our key missionaries going to that one place have been devastated.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:57.560]   Cancer with a double mastectomy and liver disease, and now this poor little baby.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:08.600]   I've known this for 40 years, just watching our missionaries be cut to pieces.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.160]   What about disease?
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:16.880]   Missionary kids dying, intensive care, freak accidents of two missionaries flying off a
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:25.040]   cliff and dying, or a whole family of five, some of you know who I'm talking about, on
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.080]   their way to the mission field, and they're all dead.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:40.720]   All five of them dead, faithful, humble missionaries on their way.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.900]   What about imprisonment?
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.600]   What about murder?
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.200]   Disease.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:55.840]   We have a sovereign Lord in heaven to whom all authority is given.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:01.440]   He rebuked fevers, and they left.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.040]   He cleansed lepers with a touch.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.560]   He opened the eyes of the blind.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.880]   He made the deaf hear and the mute speak.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.160]   He made the lame walk.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.040]   He raised the dead.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:26.680]   He spoke to the powers of hell, and they obeyed him.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:34.680]   And he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, isn't he?
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:44.640]   Which means any sickness in your church, he could just change like that.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:54.400]   And he doesn't change all of them like that.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:00.120]   Satan strikes with sickness, Luke 13, 16.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:06.280]   This woman bent over by Satan, but he's on a leash.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:11.000]   He cannot act contrary to God's decisive plan.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:21.680]   God can step in at any moment, and what he permits Satan to do, he wills to permit.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.800]   He plans to permit.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:32.680]   He doesn't permit on the spur of the moment, like, "What will I do next?
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.700]   Oh, I'll permit this."
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.060]   He doesn't permit on the spur of the moment.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:47.680]   He plans his permissions, and planned permissions is providence.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:53.640]   So get over any playing off of permissive will and sovereign will.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.240]   Just get over it.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.640]   It doesn't work.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.360]   Permissive will is planned.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:06.840]   If it's planned, it's according to his good pleasure.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:13.000]   It's folded into the plan and the design.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:23.360]   So yes, Satan went from the presence of the Lord and struck Job with loathsome sores,
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:33.520]   Job 2, 7, and three verses later, after the text says, "Satan struck Job with loathsome
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:43.660]   sores," Job says, "Shall we receive good from God and not receive evil?"
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:51.640]   To which many commentators say, "Job totally blew it in that comment.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.080]   He didn't."
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:51:00.280]   And we know he didn't because the inspired writer adds, "In all this, Job did not sin
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.440]   with his lips."
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:10.400]   And if that were not clear enough, the whole book has this flying over it as a banner in
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:17.840]   chapter 42, verse 11, one of the most remarkably unquoted passages in the book of Job by preachers
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   and scholars.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:29.320]   42, 11, "Job's family showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.400]   Lord had brought upon him."
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.160]   It's a summary of the whole book.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:41.560]   They comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:50.960]   They took his kids, all his possessions, all his health, turned his wife against him, brought
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:52:01.020]   friends whose friendship lasted about seven days, and then became really annoying.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:04.240]   This was just terrible.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:10.440]   He had these sores that crawled with maggots and he used shards to scrape the pus out.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.400]   It was horrible.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:22.560]   And the inspired writer says, "They showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:27.040]   evil that the Lord had brought upon him.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:38.920]   And Paul called his painful thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan."
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.860]   It must gall Satan, don't you think?
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:48.040]   It just must gall Satan to be made an instrument of our humility.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:51.760]   That's what it says.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:57.560]   To make him contrite, to keep him from being puffed up, he was given a thorn in the flesh,
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.360]   a messenger of Satan.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.720]   And Satan's thinking, "I don't want to make him contrite."
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.520]   And God says, "I don't know what you want.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.680]   I'm using you, buddy.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.200]   I use you.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.880]   You're on a leash and you're going to lose.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:20.960]   Don't you ever think that the misery you cause my people is sovereign.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.200]   I'm sovereign, not you."
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.440]   And oh, how our people need to feel that.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.580]   They need to feel they're not at the mercy of Satan.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.480]   They're not at the mercy of whim.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.640]   They're not at the mercy of empty fate.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.760]   They're at the mercy of a merciful Father.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:45.660]   You know, if they could trust Him, how it would transform their lives.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:54.560]   So Satan now throws Christians into prison in Revelation 2.10, and he kills them.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:02.440]   Satan can kill Christians, Revelation 2.10, he kills them.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:10.600]   There are freak accidents from a human standpoint, John 8.44, 12.31.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:17.360]   But from God's standpoint, there are no accidents, period, freak or otherwise.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.360]   Listen to James 4.15.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:25.240]   This has got to be one of the most stunning verses in the Bible with regard to providence.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.640]   James 4.15.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.800]   So instead of saying, "Come now, you who say, 'I will go up to such and such a town and
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.760]   spend a year there and trade and get gain,'" you don't know about your life, you're like
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   a vapor.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:49.440]   He said, "You ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live,'" and stop there, "'If God wills,
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.320]   I'm going to finish the sermon.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:57.840]   And if He doesn't, I won't,'" period.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.840]   This is not rocket science.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:05.920]   You don't need a Ph.D. or an M.Div. or a B.A. to understand James 4.15.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.200]   "If the Lord wills, John Piper finishes the sermon."
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.480]   Otherwise, he could just drop dead with a heart attack.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:18.960]   And if that happens, by the way, don't you anybody get in God's face about that?
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.740]   Don't ever get in God's face about anything, especially not me going home to heaven in
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:31.500]   good grief.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.460]   That's not the end of the sentence.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.460]   It gets more amazing.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:42.340]   "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.340]   What's that?
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.340]   That's it?
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.380]   Do this or that?
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:50.980]   That's everything.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.500]   Do random this?
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.500]   Random that?
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.060]   These are random.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:56:02.340]   If the Lord wills, this hand keeps doing this right here, whatever that is.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   Why does He do that?
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.660]   I have no idea.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.220]   It's that meticulous.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.580]   It's that detailed.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:17.260]   This or that.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.260]   If the Lord wills, we live.
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.300]   If the Lord wills, we die.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.140]   It is a glorious thing, and many missionaries have said it.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.380]   I am immortal till my work is done.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.660]   Isn't that a great thing?
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.780]   Good night, how happy you could be.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:32.540]   I am immortal till my work is done.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:36.140]   And when it's done, it's done, right?
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.980]   God has decided now's your time.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.860]   Come on home.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.240]   If the Lord wills.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:52.260]   So if Satan and the enemies of God rub their hands together in triumph when a Christian
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:57:00.060]   witness languishes and dies, let them hear this word from Revelation 12, 12.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:05.260]   I'm saying this out loud for Satan to hear it right now, for demons to hear it, and for
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:10.840]   you who may be called upon to give your life to hear it, Revelation 12, 12.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:17.980]   They have conquered the accuser, the serpent, by the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:22.260]   their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.940]   That's the way you conquer.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:33.500]   It looks to everybody like a loss, and it's a victory.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:47.540]   One more threat, Satan's blinding power over keeping people from believing the gospel.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:54.460]   There's the depraved human heart, and that's all it takes to keep people hard and impervious
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:58:00.860]   to the gospel, and then according to 2 Corinthians 4, Satan blinds the minds of unbelievers to
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.260]   keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.260]   God.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:17.180]   So you got Satan blinding unbelievers and Satan attempting to turn away believers from
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:23.620]   the path of obedience to make shipwreck of their faith and not be saved and thus prove
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.260]   themselves to be fake Christians.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:32.460]   So those two things, unbelievers blinded, believers constantly being pushed off the
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.380]   narrow road that leads to life.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:44.420]   That's the way Satan's going to keep this promise from being fulfilled, or is he?
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:51.900]   So neither Satan nor man is sovereign over the blindness of unbelievers, the fragile
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.380]   perseverance of Christians in faith.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.820]   God is sovereign over that.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:00.620]   God is sovereign over the new birth.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:07.940]   He's sovereign over every blood-bought perseverance in faith.
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:16.260]   The banner flying over every conversion is God made us alive in Christ by grace you have
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:28.660]   been saved, Ephesians 2, 5, and over every miracle of perseverance, conversion, lasting,
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:35.220]   God says, or we say, "Now unto Him who is able to keep you from stumbling."
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:47.060]   I remember the first T4G after I finished at Bethlehem, I guess I was 67, and that April,
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.260]   I guess I was 68 then.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:56.100]   First time to preach it together for the gospel, not being a pastor.
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.820]   And this is the text I preached on, because I was just...
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:04.900]   All I could do was reflect on how He'd kept me, how He'd kept me.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.340]   Forty-three years in the ministry, and I made it.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:12.740]   I didn't wreck it.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:18.820]   Now to Him who is able to keep me from stumbling and to present me blameless before the presence
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:25.200]   of His glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.660]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time, now and forevermore.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:37.580]   I mean, that's just about the greatest doxology in the Bible, and what prompted it?
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.900]   He kept us.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.460]   That's why He's saying that.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:46.020]   Now unto Him who is able to keep, keep, let your heart sing.
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:51.300]   If you're older and you haven't yet made shipwreck of your faith, sing that.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.500]   If you're younger, hope that, believe that, lay hold on that.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:01.460]   God is sovereign over your perseverance, and God was sovereign over your salvation.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.500]   So here's my conclusion, I'm almost done.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:14.340]   I conclude that the truth of God, the promises of God are going to triumph, all those promises.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:21.340]   So number one, the gospel of Jesus Christ will successfully penetrate all the peoples
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:29.500]   of the world and will gather into Christ all God's elect, ransomed elect.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:38.060]   Number two, all of these ransomed, the bride of Christ will be sanctified and glorified
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:46.660]   and made perfectly beautiful for the eternal enjoyment of her husband, Jesus Christ.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:56.700]   And thirdly, this beauty of the bride will be the sinless echo of Christ's excellencies,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:04.460]   His preciousness reverberating back to Him in the all-satisfying experience of pleasure
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.620]   that she has in Him.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:20.100]   The truths, these realities cannot fail because God's providence is all governing, all-pervasive,
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.940]   purposeful sovereignty are true.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.620]   They're going to happen.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:34.460]   God will see to it that everything is under control to bring about these three glorious
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:44.460]   end-time consummation promises or as He says in Isaiah 46.10, "My counsel shall stand and
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.620]   I will accomplish all my purpose."
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.420]   Let's pray.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:56.220]   Lord, where would we be in the suffering and the sorrows and the miseries of this world
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:05.860]   if we did not know that You were a God of purposeful sovereignty, namely a God of providence?
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.180]   And so I bless You.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.460]   It is well, Lord.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:21.740]   It is well with our soul when we ponder how glorious is the outcome of these promises
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:26.420]   because Your providence is undefeatable.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:31.980]   Lord, put ballast in the boats of our people.
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.500]   Many of them shed tears over the difficulty of this doctrine.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.260]   They just at first are flummoxed by it.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:42.460]   They don't have categories to embrace it.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:45.460]   Oh, make us patient, pastors.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:50.820]   Help us to build into them over time a deep love for Your sovereignty.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:55.900]   So put ballast in their boats so there are millions and millions of Christians across
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:05.180]   the world who when their boat meets great suffering waves, they will not capsize.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:09.100]   Help us to be that kind of pastor, I pray in Jesus' name.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:09.780]   Amen.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:19.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
